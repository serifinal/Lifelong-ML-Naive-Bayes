iphone 4 pre-order questions \ launch day purchase question .
sorry if this is in the wrong spot , the iphone forum did n't seem to fit as well .
in any case , i have a few questions that i hope people here can answer .
1 .
will the iphone 4 pre-orders be available on the premier site ?
my wife gets a discount through her employer and i am thinking of switching and activating via the premier site .
2 .
i am looking at a 2 iphone , 2 line family plan .
the recent launch information suggests that if we added the fan later and went to an at & t store on launch day that we would be restricted to one iphone even though we want a 2 line family plan .
is that really correct ?
3 .
how difficult is it to add the fan after the fact ?
her discount gives free activation .
if we add the fan later will we be able to get a credit for the activation fee ?
edit : 4 .
does at & t offer any sort of service like caller tunes aka ring back tunes ?
thanks !!!! jeff
