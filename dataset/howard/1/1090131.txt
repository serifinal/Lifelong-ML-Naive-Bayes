current prepaid account , can i port in old number from at&t / t-mobile ? .
i have a couple of lines on family accounts and i was wondering if i could chose to port one in to my verizon prepaid ?
i keep the verizon prepaid in the car for emergencies because of the coverage , will i be able to call in to verizons prepaid customer service and port in a number or would i have to buy a new phone ?
thanks in advance .
