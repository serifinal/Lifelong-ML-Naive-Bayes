multiple homescreens .
hi all , are there any other ways of getting more launch screens other than using ahome ?
i need about 5 homescreens . .
7 is too much and 3 is too little .
i guess i can use 7 homescreens and just fill up 5 , but that means i 'll have to use sense , which i prefer to avoid .
