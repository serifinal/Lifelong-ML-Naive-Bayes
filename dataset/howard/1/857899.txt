micro sd cards 32 gig for the bold 9700 .
i 'm pretty excited about the 9700 and i want to use it to it 's full abilities once it comes out .
one of the things i 've been doing is trying to find microsd 32 gig cards , and they seem to be surprisingly rare .
the only place i 've found them in ebay really , and they are listed over 100 bucks .
anyone have any idea where to pickup some cheap mircosd 32 gig cards that will go so nicley into my 9700 ?
thanks in advance !
