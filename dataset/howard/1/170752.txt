will any lg micro-usb data cable work .
i am looking on ebay for a data transfer cable to use with bitpim or datapilot for reading the contacts off the phone .
but i 've noticed that if i search for -lrb- ax155 , `` ax 155 '' -rrb- -lrb- data , transfer , usb , cable -rrb- the prices are -lrb- naturally -rrb- higher than a search for -lrb- microusb , `` micro usb '' -rrb- -lrb- data , transfer , usb , cable -rrb- .
but will pretty much any data cable work ?
especially if it mentions it 's compatible with a similar lg phone ?
also what software works with the ax * phones ?
will lg desktop , lg phone manager , or lg phone tools work with them ?
i bought an ax5000 off of ebay and want to move my stuff over to it .
