is it possible to have a rogers iphone with data only ?
no voice plan . .
i have an iphone that is off contract that i bought when i needed a new ipod , in hopes that telus ' hspa network would be ready .
but it looks like i have to wait until january .
is it possible to use the iphone with a data only plan , with no voice plan ?
i need to keep my number with telus , and its in a contact , so i do n't want to switch .
sorry if this has been posted before .
