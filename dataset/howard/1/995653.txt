adding new line + data to new family plan ? .
i am currently with at&t and looking to switch over to verizon to get myself a shiny new droid .
my mom is currently on verizon by herself -lrb- just a voice/text , 1 line plan -rrb- .
i would like to add myself onto her plan .
how can i do this ?
from what i 've gathered on the verizon website and several forum posts , it looks like my best option is to get the nationwide select family shareplan .
$ 99.99 -lrb- that 's $ 90 plus $ 9.99 for the second line -rrb- for 700 shared minutes , unlimited texts .
then since i 'll be getting the droid , i 'll need the $ 29.99 data plan for my line .
she does n't need data .
she has a 20 % company discount so -lrb- $ 90 - 20 % -rrb- + $ 9.99 + $ 29.99 = $ 111.98 plus taxes/fees .
am i correct in that this plan is available and will meet my needs ?
also , it is my understanding that the 2-year contracts on each line are independent of one another ; is that correct ?
that is , my mom 's contract still has a few months remaining , but i will still be able to get the droid for $ 199.99 with a new 2 year contract for my new line , right ?
and she will still have her contract expire in a few months as usual -lrb- i.e. no forced contract extension for her -rrb- ?
thank you for your help .
