tutorial : setup iphone 4 as a new phone , but save sms , photos , game saves , etc. .
so i started a thread a few days back looking for ways to setup iphone 4 as a new phone rather than restoring it from backup of my iphone 3g/3gs .
just in case , someone comes looking for it later , here is a quick writeup of what i found : how its done : what you need : 1 -rrb- jailbroken iphone 3g/3gs 2 -rrb- iphone 4 setup as new phone and jailbroken .
3 -rrb- iphone explorer installed on your pc or mac .
steps : 1 -rrb- on your iphone 3g/3gs -- > install `` applinks '' from cydia .
this app creates a folder in your iphone that links all the applications in an easy to view manner .
2 -rrb- on your iphone 3g/3gs -- > run `` applinks '' and hit the `` refresh '' button .
this is create all the links .
3 -rrb- with your iphone 3g/3gs still plugged in -- > open iphone explorer and browse to : `` your iphone/root directory/var/mobile / applinks '' 4 -rrb- copy any of the application data you want -- > -lrb- for me , it was angry birds , sms , voicemail , etc. -rrb- folders to look in : ruski?s iphone/root directory/var/mobile / library/sms/sms .
db ruski?s iphone/root directory/var/mobile / library/voicemail/voicemail .
db ruski?s iphone/root directory/var/mobile / applinks/angrybirds .
app/documents / ... any other apps/games you treasure 5 -rrb- connect your new jailbroken iphone 4 via usb and open up `` iphone explorer '' 6 -rrb- copy over any of the application settings files -lrb- * .
plist , etc. -rrb- that you saved into the appropriate directories .
final tips : it makes it easier to find your applications if you install applinks on iphone 4 first .
in some cases , you may need to run the application on the iphone 4 first , so that it creates the initial directory structure and files for saved games/settings .
then browse via iphone explorer and copy .
let me know if you have any questions .
cheers .
