new user iphone4 .
hey gang i just switched over from tmobile on launch day to the new iphone4 , i was with tmo for many years and been using my unlocked iphones in the past .
finally made the switch anyways ever since i got my iphone i can not access 3g network data .
ive done everything from soft restart to hard restart to on off 3g signal and called csr which they were no help at all . .
they told me i was holding the phone wrong i told him i know about that already its not the problem .
i was never able to access from day one !
only way i get on is through wifi .
anyways the csr told me to wait a few days to a week till things clear up on the network your phone might not be completely activated and i told him what does that mean ?
he said oh you arent able to make or get calls txt messages .
and i was like no my phone is working totally fine am using it to make this call right now no problem .
anyways is happening to other users as well ?
am calling att tomorrow again to see whats up i dont want to be paying for data this month if am never going be able to use it till a few weeks later that doesnt make sense to me .
or at least it better be prorated a whole lot
