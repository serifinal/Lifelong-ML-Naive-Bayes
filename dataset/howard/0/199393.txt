acii - new required feature `` data roam restrict am ch $ 0 '' seen when adding msg plan .
so for the first time since the big vcast change , i went to add a messaging package to my account -lrb- for a single day , of course -rrb- .
i 'm sitting at the confirmation page , and there is a new feature that i 've never seen before that the system is trying to add to the account as i make the change .
=========================== add features ------------- unlimited mobile to mobile messaging plus 500 additional messages $ 10.00 / month data roam restrict am ch $ 0 $ 0.00 this is a minimum required feature for your device .
remove features ---------------- video & picture messaging -lrb- $ 0.25 / message -rrb- ; text message -lrb- $ 0.20 / message -rrb- $ 0.00 this conflicts with unlimited mobile to mobile messaging plus 500 additional messages .
============================ that 's a scary sounding feature , so i 'm holding off on confirming the change .
has anyone seen this feature or have any idea what it means ?
i did n't see it mentioned anywhere in a search , so i wonder how new it is .
as for acii data , we have always been restricted to verizon network only data access .
mobile web / vcast / picture messaging still does not work in extended network areas .
i try it every couple months on uscellular 's network in northern wv , but it is still disabled .
i do n't know if this feature is just clarifying that restriction or adding additional restrictions to the account .
i guess i could always hope that they are removing the restrictions from acii , and now only this feature will stand in the way of data access on extended networks , but i wo n't hold my breath .
