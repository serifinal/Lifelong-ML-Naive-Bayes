assistance required inregards to wireless mobile internet .
hello , i 've been using datajack in january when they were $ 40 monthly with advertised unlimited download .
i only used it for 2 months , just recently i 'm in need of wireless mobile internet again .
i just found out that datajack has jacked up there prices to $ 50 monthly and 5gb limit .
basically i need internet on the go for my laptop , i know about the i425 boostmobile motorola tethering which i believe get 's you dial up speed nether the less its unlimited .
the reason i 'm posting here though is i would like to know is there something out there like say tethering 3g speed or something better then dial up but cost efficient , my sole purpose is cost efficiency and i was wondering if there are better alternatives as opposed to paying $ 50 dollars for datajack 5gb limit .
i heard millenicom is unlimited for $ 70 but the problem is i would have to shell out 100 's just for new modem .
so basically my main concerns is unlimited downloads with decent speeds say 1 mbps or something but off course with lowest cost .
so i was thinking tethering or something , anyways if anybody know 's what i 'm getting at would appreciate the input .
i live in nyc and thats where i will be using the service
