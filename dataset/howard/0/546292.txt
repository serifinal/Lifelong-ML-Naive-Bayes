iphone 4 drops less calls !
-lrb- from engadget review -rrb- .
you heard it from engadget !
of course , the big internal story is what has become external : namely , the umts , gps , wifi , and bluetooth antennas .
apple has made the stainless band around the phone essentially a couple of big antennae , and they seem to be doing a pretty good job at hanging onto radio signals .
the big question is obviously whether or not this fixes or helps with the constant dropped calls iphone users on at&t 's network have gotten used to .
well in our testing , we had far , far fewer dropped calls than we experienced on our 3gs .
let 's just say that again : yes , the iphone 4 does seem to alleviate the dropped call issue .
it was n't perfect , and we had some connection issues in downtown new york city in particular , though it 's tough to say if it was the fault of our phone , the cluster of buildings we were near , or the person we were speaking to , who was on a 3gs in the same location .
http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/22/iphone-4-review/ i 'm interested in hearing from others on how well the new antenna/chip combo works .
