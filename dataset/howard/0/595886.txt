sony tm506 settings for wind .
hi : i recently joined windmobile and bought a sony tm506 and was wondering if anyone else purchased this phone ?
if so , i have the following questions : -lrb- 1 -rrb- debranding : need to debrand phone -lrb- get rid of t-mobile crap -rrb- and was wondering if anyone has done this successfully already ?
does anyone have a surefire `` how to '' on how to do this ?
-lrb- 2 -rrb- picture message + web settings : does anyone know what the proper settings are for the phone to send/receive picture messages ?
although i can get text messages , i can not send or receive picture messages .
when i look @ the settings on my phone , there 's just no way to figure out what to set it to .
has anyone been able to set theirs up ?
i 'd really appreciate it if you can help !
thanks !
