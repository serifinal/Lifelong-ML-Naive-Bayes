source : sizlopedia samsung ctia event sources report that the sexy looking samsung galaxy s will getting a new home at t-mobile .
bluetooth sig has approved this android beauty and has named it samsung sch-t959 following the t-mobile naming convention .
we will still be referring it to as t-mobile samsung galaxy s to make our life easier .
there appears to be some suspicion regarding the device identity being other galaxy s. specs wise the device definitely looks the one we want with a 4 inch amoled touchscreen , android os and of course samsung 's very own touchwiz 3.0 the question here is of course this - will the samsung galaxy be able to do wonders like the recently launched t-mobile htc hd2 ?
t-mobile and samsung folks will definitely be hoping for that to happen again .
