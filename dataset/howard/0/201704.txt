hey all ; just decided to d/l this programme right now and find it allows for great remote access to phone functions ; 1 -rrb- send and receive sms/txt from your computer without picking up your phone -lrb- threaded by conversation -rrb- 2 -rrb- automatically upload photos and videos captured on the go to easily organize and share with your friends 3 -rrb- add an address book contact on your computer and have it instantly appear on your phone 4 -rrb- easily set internet favorites , ringtones , wallpapers , and speed dials ?
in seconds from your computer 5 -rrb- single click media upload to facebook , flickr , friendfeed , twitter & bebo 6 -rrb- update your status on facebook & twitter 7 -rrb- visual voicemail on your computer -lrb- or as i call it , power vvm -rrb- i dont usually try these progs until i read more about in on hofo but this time i couldnt resist ; you control which items sync and when it happens .
dashwire connects across wireless data , wi-fi , bluetooth , and usb .
