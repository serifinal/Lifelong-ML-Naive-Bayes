facetime & headsets .
i 've got a decent plantronics 855 bluetooth stereo headset that i use daily for music and calls .
i ca n't seem to get it to work while on a facetime call .
i 've tried facetime dialing , direct dialing then adding facetime , switching from being called to being the calling party , and all variations of these configurations .
anyone have a possible solution ?
it seems every facetime call requires that you use the built-in mic for speakerphone setting .
i do n't know why , since facetime could be very useful in a very noisy environment , but i do n't see an option for mic selection like on standard calls with a bluetooth set connected .
are we going to need a jailbreak and app for this also ?
we have two iphone 4 's in our household , so i 'm open to test any suggestions .
