dropping 3g/hsdpa connection .
i 've had my htc magic from rogers -lrb- 32a -rrb- for about 3 weeks now .
i live in the us but no matter what rom i use the connection keeps disconnecting .
so the way it happens is that i start the phone , all is fine , i can browse then a few minutes later i can not ping nor browse it seems as the data connection just dies .
i 've tried the hofo rom , stock rogers rom , hero roms , and all of them have the same issue .
i 've tried playing with the apn settings but they all seem correct .
i 'm also running haykuro 's spl with the latest radio version .
does anyone have any suggestions ?
