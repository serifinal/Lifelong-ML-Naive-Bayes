question for anyone who knows about adding a line/family plan .
i know this is a very basic question but i can not seem to understand what t-mobile .
com has on this subject i have two questions : do you have to renew your contract when you add a line ?
does that automatically make your plan a `` family plan ? ''
please tell me if i am understanding this correctly : you pay $ 10/month to get an extra number which uses minutes from your original plan -lrb- as opposed to a new plan -rrb- ?
thanks !!!
