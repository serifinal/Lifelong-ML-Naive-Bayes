iphone users go back to blackberry ?
iphone or bb 9700 ? .
i had a bb for about 3Â 1/2 years and switched from an 8900 to an iphone 3gs in june .
i had a pearl prior to the 8900 .
i returned the 8900 within the 30 day hassle free return window .
the touchscreen is great for browsing , apps , games and a few other things , but is not that great for typing emails in my opinion .
i miss the full qwerty keyboard .
the bb has true push email and you can do more customization with the device .
if bb could come close to the iphone 's safari browser and customization , i would jump back in an instant .
the killer browsing experience on the iphone is the only thing that could hold me from going back to bb .
i do tons of browsing on my iphone .
i guess the bb browser is just ok and the safari browser is great .
i even miss the led light on the bb and a few other minor things , but they are a big deal to me .
these are some reasons why i would go back .
the 9700 looks like the best bb yet .
