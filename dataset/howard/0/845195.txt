is it possible to convert a 6gb data plan to rocket stick ? .
the cell number itself is now month to month with no contract but the 6gb plan is on a contract until june 2012 .
i searched and found out some thread saying that it is not possible to take over the $ 30 6gb plan portion only and transfer it to my existing voice plan as is it tied in with the original cell phone number ?
if i ca n't separate the 6gb plan is there a way to convert the data plan it to be used with a rocket stick instead ?
thanks for any information and i 'll keep searching for an answer in the meantime .
