engadget review of nexus one : they prefer the droid .
the engadget review of the nexus one was kind of a letdown .
http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/04/nexus-one-review/ i did find this comment near the end interesting `` it 's a good android phone , but not the last word -- in fact , if we had to choose between this phone or the droid right now , we would lean towards the latter . ''
surprising comments .
something i was not expecting .
