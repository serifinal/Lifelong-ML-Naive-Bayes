sprint embraces android on srdo data-only plans 15 commentswritten by christopher price on october 12 , 2009 google android -lrb- oha -rrb- , htc , samsung , sprint srdo , or sprint relay data only , has become popular amongst those looking for a post-sero value plan .
led originally by phonenews.com?s coverage , the plan has been tacitly embraced by sprint as a not-so under-the-table offering of a data-only plan for tech-savvy consumers .
the $ 30 plan offers unlimited data , text messaging , and 5 gb of phone as modem service .
on everything-plan-required phones like the palm pre , the plan trades 5 gb of pam for basic sprint tv and sprint navigation service .
and , starting today , the plan is now available for android phones on sprint .
android joins the palm pre , blackberry , and windows mobile , as well as non-smartphones in being offered on the plan .
the htc hero is available for sale from sprint?s relay store web site , and existing sprint relay customers can switch to an android phone with the help of a plan specialist .
sprint has also confirmed to phonenews.com that the samsung moment will be available on srdo , next month .
