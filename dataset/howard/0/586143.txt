samsung caliber sch-r860 download mode / emergency ?
stuck on loop .
ok my girls caliber is stuck on loop .
samsung screen comes up loads up and then restarts .
hoping to figure out someway to reflash the software / firmware to the phone .
googles / searched for info on this and couldnt find any .
i figured out how to put it in download mode which i couldnt find that anywhere either .
download emergency mode - press the tty button , volume down button , and home / center button , and the power button to load into this mode .
