new micro projector - upgrade ... keep or no ? .
wellllll i 'm an impulse buyer and decided to upgrade my micro projector from the aaxa p2 to the m1 ... it blows my old one out of the water , but my question is : has anyone seen anything extraordinary from ces that would make me want to return this while i 'm still in my return limit ?
preferably , if i 'm going to upgrade , it should cost nearly the same as what i paid -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- .
i keep seeing the optoma pk301 but its not available to the public yet and suggested retail is about double mine .
the downside to the pk301 is that it is n't as bright as mine -lrb- 50 lumens to my 66 lumens -rrb- but it seems way smaller .
those are the only reasons i can think of to not buy right now .
i already have my cable that connects to my n97 and it works well as it is .
anyone have more input that will sway me ?
i 'm dead in the middle .
i make a decent living but spend way too much .
