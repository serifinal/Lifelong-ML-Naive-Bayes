port blocking status ? .
can anyone tell me the status on the port blocking issue ?
i have n't seen anything on it for a while and am wondering whether i simply missed it .
last i heard -lrb- quite a while ago -rrb- wind was taking a white list approach -lrb- which we all seemed to agree was the incorrect approach -rrb- , and there were still a number of applications having problems due to this .
is that still the case ?
is wind hell-bent on continuing with a white-list approach ?
has wind even explained why it needs to do this -lrb- which we all seem to agree is unnecessary from a security point of view -rrb- .
