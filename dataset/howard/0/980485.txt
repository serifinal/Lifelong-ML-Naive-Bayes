great micro sim adapter ! .
i know a lot of people are cutting and mutilating , taping , gluing , etc etc. .
but seriously , stop with the shenanigans .
gizmodo posted about the microsim-shop .
com , and their adapter .
so i ordered 5 .
under 20 bucks .
i 'm giving a few away to friends , and keeping the rest for myself .
they fit and work perfectly .
price is great , and shipping is fast .
i got mine in about a week , shipped from austria .
