ca n't sync outlook calendar to t-749 . .
samsung sgh-t749 using new pc studio ver .
1.2.0 iec .
when i try to sync outlook calendar with the phone calendar it runs out of memory .
i do n't know if it is using the internal mem. , but i do n't see a way to direct it to use the sd card .
it also mentions that it is getting email info from outlook .
does this mean that it is also syncing the address book ?
i only want to keep the calendar on the phone synced .
anyone have any input ?
thanks , kev
