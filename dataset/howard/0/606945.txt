softbank network settings ?
-lrb- sms server , mobile internet ap , e-mail server -rrb- .
i want to populate my nokia with softbank usim .
now it can only voicecall .
so i need original -lrb- and hidden in sharp handset -rrb- settings : 1 -rrb- sms portal phone number 2 -rrb- mobile internet access point -lrb- the one that has upper limit of charge for `` unlimited mobile internet pc site browsing '' ~ $ 60 -rrb- 3 -rrb- settings for e-mail/s !
mail -lrb- is s!mail basically mms ?
or not ? -rrb-
how to send/receive s!mail via nokia handset .
i do n't need immediate receive of incoming mail , but if this could be done in pop3/imap mode - that 's ok .
the problems are regional characters and t9 input on sharp phone .
on nokia i can install complete set of japanese fonts/codepage/input for symbian -lrb- about ~ $ 15 for s/w package -rrb- .
of course nokia is a piece of crap .
but this crap is useful for sms/mails in european-languages .
at least it can process `` joint sms '' .
