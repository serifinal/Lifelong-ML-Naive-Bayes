is it possible to transfer my cellphone contract but also be able to port my # ? .
im transferring my rogers plan to another person , but i also want to transfer/keep my current cell phone number and transfer it to fido .
is this possible ?
when i called rogers , they said its not possible cuz when they port my number , it cancels my service completely .
does anyone know a way to keep my number ?
i 'd hate to have a new number after having my current number for more than 4 years .
