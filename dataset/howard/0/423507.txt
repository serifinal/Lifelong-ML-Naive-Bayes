thought of a great idea for a mytouch 3.5 mm adapter .
instead of making a cable why does n't somebody just make like a small adapter that would be flush with the bottom of the phone with the 3.5 mm port on the side ?
it would only add maybe half of a centimeter in length and it could stay there ... edit : kind of like this , but extend the full length of the phone and have another usb port on the bottom
