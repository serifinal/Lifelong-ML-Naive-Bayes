bell turbo stick and 10.6 osx .
hey guys , so i read some threads on here regarding this and the driver links etc that i got from the threads didn ; t help . .
just wondering if there is an update on if this works ?
bell told me i am sol cause mc is not supported via 10.6 i got it to work once -lrb- had the sticks for a day -rrb- and since then it connects but no data is sent/received .
any ideas ?
