how to change grps/wap settings and un-brand samsung gravity i .
i have an unlocked t-mobile samsung gravity i -lrb- t-459 -rrb- .
how to find a way of changing its grps/wap/data settings ?
is there some hidden menu or something ?
more generally , how to -lrb- completely -rrb- un-brand the phone , remove t-zones , t-mobile mobile backup , etc ?
if it matters , my gravity was unlocked using an unlock code provided by t-mobile customer service .
