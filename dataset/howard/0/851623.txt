anyone want a $ 30/mo unlimited data account ? .
apparently i entered into a contract without any sort of agreement on my part and sprint is not wanting to cooperate in the least so anyone want to take over liability on this ?
its a $ 30 per month unlimited data account -lrb- signed up for as radio shack employee -rrb- , i would greatly prefer this go to someone who will use a massive amount of data each month .
i 'm taking contracts this semester but i really do n't think i want to get into a legal battle with spring over the intricacies of contract law since i 'm sure they have attorneys with about a billion times more knowledge than myself .
oh , the kicker ... i called and canceled the account mid november and was told everything was good , the line was canceled and the device was even removed from my sprint.com account ... and then i got another bill yesterday .
