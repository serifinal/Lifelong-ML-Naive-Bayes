why uscc is the best wireless provider in the u.s. .
i just got a call from my local uscc store -lrb- answer wireless in crystal lake -rrb- they were contacted by corporate customer support about my post either on here or facebook regarding equipment returns .
the manager apologized and said that i can return the acclaim within the 30 days and activate my old phone and resign my contract as soon as the desire comes out -lrb- no 90 day waiting period -rrb- .
you ca n't get that level of customer service from another carrier .
thanks us cellular .
