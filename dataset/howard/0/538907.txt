ipad micro sim is apparently different than iphone 4 micro sim .
i just tried to switch from a normal sim to a micro sim that i ordered online last week but bell 's website would n't accept the serial number .
i called in to find out that apparently this micro sim card ca n't be used in a phone because it is provisioned for an ipad .
they told me i should go to a bell store and buy another micro sim card designed for the phone .
anyone know how they could be different or how you can tell the difference ?
why i 'm doing this is because i want to use the micro sim card in my 3gs -lrb- with an adaptor -rrb- and put it in my ipad on long trips -lrb- obviously only for data -rrb- .
