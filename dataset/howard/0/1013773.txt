camera roll says -lrb- 30 -rrb- yet no pictures ?? .
this is n't a huge problem , but just something that bugs me .
i deleted all pics from camera roll , only had 46 , just stupid random shots .
now the camera roll shows 30 with no thumbnail preview , and when i go into camera roll it says no photo 's / vids etc. .
i even did a restore and completely wiped the 3gs 32gb through itunes .
restored from last backup etc , everything great except for it still says i have 30 pics yet there is 0 in that folder .
even when i go into the iphone not using itunes -lrb- iphone camera/windows -rrb- there is nothing there , not even any hidden folders etc. .
iphone is up to date with 3.1 and such , mms also . .
that works pretty good i must say .
ps i 've tried taking more pictures , and deleting them , thinking this would refresh it-no luck .
the 2-button reboot multiple times , nothing .
