seems t-mobile samsung vibrant can work on the big 3 's 3g network .
i found an interesting thread in xda developer site .
someone there with an unlocked vibrant got 3g on at&t .
i think at&t is using the same 3g bands as big3s .
i have no intention to leave wind but it 's nice to have a choice .
it seems this phone is more capable than the official spec .
tells us .
