adding the ul bbm/im/email plan to my voice plan .
hey guys im thinking of adding the $ 15 unlimited blackberry messaging -lrb- pin to pin -rrb- email plan to my existing voice plan .
i just have a few questions and wondering if anyone can help me with this . .
1 -rrb- do i need to call in to get this done ?
2 -rrb- at present my internet on the phone is blocked . .
will i need to unblock this service ?
-lrb- though i dont need to browse just check my emails and bbm only -rrb- so i dont need any overages .
3 -rrb- with instant messaging . .
does that mean i can have my msn/yahoo whatever it may be on 24/7 without being charged a sent extra ?
also i can pin to pin till my fingers hurt ?
with anyone around the world ?
4 -rrb- also what about attachments in an email ?
does it cost more on the size of the attachment ?
can i use my existing email address ?
5 -rrb- if i do call in do get this . .
will i have to have it on for 1 year minimum or be bound on a contract ?
6 -rrb- finally . .
is there any type of credits i can ask for ?
sorry for the list of questions guys , since i get most of my information from this site i figured id ask the knowledgeable folk here . .
thanks in advance . .
