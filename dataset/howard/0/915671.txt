trading : 16gb iphone 3g -lsb- s -rsb- locked to bell for 16gb iphone 3g -lsb- s -rsb- locked to rogers .
hi , i recently acquired a white 16gb iphone 3g -lsb- s -rsb- that is locked to bell .
at the moment it can not be unlocked since it 's on firmware 3.1.3 and baseband 5.12.01 .
i am on rogers ... so the phone is of no use for me .
i would like to trade my iphone 3g -lsb- s -rsb- for a white iphone 3g -lsb- s -rsb- locked to rogers .
condition : 9.8 / 10 .
the phone is in great condition , except for a minor scratch that is hardly noticeable .
the phone should be fairly close to the condition of my phone .
the phone does not have a box , however i only require the phone .
willing to trade with anyone in the gta .
-lrb- should meet at a subway line or a popular mall -rrb-
