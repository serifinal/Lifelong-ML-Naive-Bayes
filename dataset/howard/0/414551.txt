cheney gets praise and protest at wyoming event by mead gruver -lrb- ap -rrb- ?
1 day ago laramie , wyo. ?
praise and protest greeted former vice president **** cheney as he visited his alma mater thursday for the dedication of a new international center bearing his name .
about 100 protesters heckled cheney throughout the dedication ceremony for the university of wyoming 's cheney international center .
cheney and his wife lynne donated $ 3.2 million for the new center for foreign students and for scholarships for wyoming students to study abroad .
protesters made up about a fifth of the crowd of about 500 and hoisted critical signs : `` shame on uw '' and `` we do n't want your blood money . ''
`` they violated international law .
they had no respect for other countries , '' jennie boshell , a senior at the university , said of the bush administration .
`` to put cheney 's name on an international center is ridiculous and it makes the university look stupid . ''
another protester , dan depeyer , said he is studying democratization in the former soviet republics and may well have received some of the cheneys ' money to study abroad .
`` if i were ever to study in a muslim society ?
say , saudi arabia ?
i would n't tell anybody over there i was funded by money that came from **** cheney , '' depeyer said .
**** and lynne cheney both spoke at the event .
**** cheney said his time as a student at the university of wyoming laid the foundation for an `` extraordinary career . ''
`` we hope that this center will provide the kind of support for wyoming students to travel overseas , to travel internationally , to learn a lot of the lessons that we 've learned over the years , '' he said .
the former vice president endured shouts from the protesters gathered around the back of the crowd but got a standing ovation from those in front .
another well-known wyoming political figure , former u.s. sen. alan simpson , rose to cheney 's defense in introducing his longtime friend .
`` this is a proud state , this is a proud family , and we 're proud of them , '' simpson said .
the last three presidential administrations , he said , all endured a lot of petty criticism .
`` it is easy to second-guess .
it is easy to protest ?
takes no brains , '' simpson said .
the cheneys ' gift came with no strings attached and the university does n't subject its donors to a public referendum , university president tom buchanan said afterward .
`` everyone has a different take on the cheney vice presidency .
i think he is by far the university 's most accomplished alum , both in this state and in national politics , '' buchanan said .
`` whether you agree with him or not , he certainly is a sincere gentleman and we 're very glad he came back to visit his campus . ''
