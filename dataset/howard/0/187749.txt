wireless modem and my account .
hello all , is there any way to add the wireless modem service to the `` my account '' page online ?
it asks for a pin sent via text that the modem ca n't receive .
cs rep said it ca n't be done , i 'm just wondering if there is a way that she may not have known of .
thanks !
