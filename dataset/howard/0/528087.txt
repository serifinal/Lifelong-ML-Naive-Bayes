bell samsung galaxy s , kies , sync outlook .
i use outlook for corporate email -lrb- the email server is mdaemon , not exchange : i use an app called outlook connector for mdaemon and outlook is fully functional -rrb- .
i want to sync my contacts and calendar to the galaxy .
from another thread here , i know there is a way to get gmail and outlook working together but i 'm not pursuing that right away .
so far i can not find a reliable syncml app for the android-based smartphone , so an `` over-the-air '' sync is not in the picture .
if you know of an app that works , please post !
meantime , i will try to use kies as the intermediary between outlook and the galaxy .
wondering if any of you have installed and run kies and successfully got a sync going with outlook ?
if it has n't worked , i would appreciate hearing about the issues you had .
thanks .
