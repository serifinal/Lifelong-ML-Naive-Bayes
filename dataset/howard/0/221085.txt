wind mobile misses the points - help wind mobile improve .
i am a new wind mobile customer but have been reading this forum for a long period of time .
i switched over from fido a week ago once my contract had almost expired .
it is understandable that promotions will get you many customers but will they be long-term staying ones ?
there are plenty of abuses around , frankly wind mobile was and is continuing asking for .
the flippers who are only interested in saving a buck or two will not help wind mobile survive in any way .
there are plenty of people will be interested in wind mobile service , promotion or not , because they have fed up with the big 3 .
you may not agree , but to me , current offerings without promotion is competitive enough .
offering per-second billing could potentially bring more chat customers switching from the big-3 .
i wish wind mobile could focus more on customer service , improve customer communication -lrb- so no current billing fiasco occurring -rrb- , and network coverage .
once you build a solid brand , people will come .
i hope wind mobile is here to stay and really hate that i would have to go back to the big 3 .
what is your take ?
