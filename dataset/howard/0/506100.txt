upgrading two phones . .
two questions . . .
hopefully the right forum or subforum . .
we have a family plan from alltel .
three phones .
phone # 1 is up for renewal now .
phone # 2 is up 4/1 .
phone # 3 -lrb- primary phone/every 2 -rrb- is up 12/18/10 .
# 1 .
phone # 1 belongs to mother in law , who does n't need a new phone .
phone # 2 and phone # 3 belong to myself and my wife , and we both need the new phone .
alltel would allow us to renew whatever lines we wanted when it was time , and could transfer the contract to a different phone -lrb- in this case , contract up for renewal on 12/18 could go to phone # 1 , phone # 2 and # 3 are replaced -rrb- .
i hope this makes sense .
the question is : vzw willing to do this too ?
or was this an alltel thing ?
# 2 .
anyone know when bogo is up ?
i 'm worried about doing all this on 4/1 and bogo being gone , as my wife and i want to get the droid .
i called customer service and of course they could n't tell me , and they could n't forgive this last pending month of renewal , which is bs .
