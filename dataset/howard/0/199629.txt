upgrading and activation questions .
today i called about my tour 's trackball problems and cs is sending me a brand new bold as they are out of tour 's .
you can imagine how disappointed i am ... of course i am kidding .
another family member is about to use their ne2 and get a bold .
i was wondering if it would be possible for me to give them my new phone and for me to use their upgrade on a droid .
how would this work for things such as insurance or warranties ?
would it make a difference if i did not activate it when i receive it ?
i do n't think it would be right if their new phone did n't have the warranty or insurance .
i would just keep mine .
thanks for any replies i receive , i figure this is a good place to ask since i know there are a lot of knowledgeable employees/customers who would know these answers .
