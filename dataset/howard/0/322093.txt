after being updated , apps still showing in appstore available updates .
i was wondering if anyone else is having the same problem .
it started about 2 weeks ago .
i run appstore updates on my iphone and i find let say there is one app that needs to be updated .
i download and install the update and run appstore updates again just to find out that it is still showing that the same application is still in need to be updated .
no matter how many times i do it , it still shows in the available updates .
i verified that after the first update the application did actually update and is running the latest version .
the bug happened only with certain apps : betterlists , cardstar , pandorabox , virtuoso piano free .
the same problem happened also on my pc 's itunes with the same applications so i do n't think the problem is in the phone itself .
i could be either within appstore or the applications themselves i emailed appstore support and they said it is not their problem .
i asked them to forward it to the right support department and all i get back is the same prewritten statement that this is not their problem .
i called iphone tech support and they were going to charge me a fee for the call -lrb- i 'm out of the 90 days free support -rrb- but they gave me a one time courtesy free support .
they said the problem is within the applications not sending to the appstore the correct version info after updates .
they said the only way to correct that would be to delete the application and reinstall it fresh .
i did that and it worked for 3 of the 4 apps in question -lrb- except for pandorabox -rrb- , but that way i lost all the personal info on the app and i needed to enter everything from scratch ... pain in the neck .
i contacted the applications authors and they said that the problem is not in their applications and it must be an appstore problem .
so go figure .
any insight would be appreciated .
thanks .
