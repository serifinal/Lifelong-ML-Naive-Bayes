make some noise about port blocking .
come on , hofo .
you guys ca n't possibly be all happy with the port blocking situation .
having a cool app not work over 3g , having to ask pretty please for them to open the relevant ports , and then waiting months until the app does n't seem that cool anymore is unbearable .
make comments on wind 's community site and let them know you 're still not happy .
i 'm not saying you should n't also be asking for them to open ports you need , but if people stay quiet about the overall issue they may start to think that the large majority of people who care are happy .
app i 'm upset about right now : ustream .
