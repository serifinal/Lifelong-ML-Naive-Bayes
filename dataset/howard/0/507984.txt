motorola razr v3 - never seen this issue .
hi everyone .
i have searched the web high and low and have n't been able to find anything whatsoever about this problem .
i do n't know all of the technical jargon , so i hope i can make this clear .
on the center , round navigation button on the keypad , there is a small , circular piece that sits inside the button itself .
mine has dislodged .
i still have the piece , and am wondering what would be the best way to reseat the circular piece .
the only idea i have is perhaps to use a tiny bit of adhesive , but i do n't want to screw up and accidentally glue the keys .
it 's not a huge deal , but the phone looks better with the little ring , and the button is n't as responsive without it .
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated .
happy holidays !
