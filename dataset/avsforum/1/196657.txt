samsung ln32a450 or lg 32lg40 .
i am trying to decide between both of these two 32in 720p lcd 's .
they both seem comparable to each other -lrb- except for the fact that the lg comes with a built in dvd player -rrb- .
any suggestions or advice to push me one way or the other would be appreciated .
the reviews on both tv 's are excellent so i am trying to find that little extra ... to help me decide .
thanks for the help !
