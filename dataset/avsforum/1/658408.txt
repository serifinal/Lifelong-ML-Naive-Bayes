just impule bought a panny th42pz80u ... couple questions for you all . .
my only other hd set has been a 1080p dlp .
late last week my old tube tv crapped out in the bedroom .
i went online and without much research at all i purchased the panasonic th42pz80u -lrb- the deal ... from an authorized panny dealer ... sure seemed to be a great one -rrb- .
anyway , now it 's been delivered and directv has been out to hook me up with a hd dvr ... but ... i 've got no idea of the proper settings and the `` 100 break in '' guidelines that i 've heard about .
by chance , can somebody direct me to a quick reference on the proper settings as well as break-in guidelines ?
i 'm really trying to avoid having to read through the thousands of posts in the `` owners thread '' if at all possible .
one last thing ... is there such a thing as `` motion blur '' with plasmas ?
i was doing some late night tv watching the other night on the new set and could have sworn the pixels were breaking up from time to time .
thanks !
