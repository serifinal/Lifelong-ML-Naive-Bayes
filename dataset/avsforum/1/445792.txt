speakers having more power than reciever ? .
i have been reading a little bit on the forums here about damaging speakers if they are not getting enough power ... the receiver `` clips '' or something like that ... i am not exactly sure of what that means ... here is the question i ask . .
i am going to be getting an onkyo tx-sr606 and was thinking about getting the energy rc-50s as they are on sale for a pretty good price ... the question i have is , is this going to be a problem ?
the 606 outputs 90 watts rms per channel ... it looks like the rc-50 's power is rated at 225 watts ... is this a big problem or am i just being paranoid ?
thanks for any information .
i did try to do some searches , but it did n't help very much unfortunately
