samsung a550 or toshiba xf550 ? .
is the pq of the toshiba pretty much on par with samsung ?
black levels , colors , sharpness , motion blur .
the a550 is a lot cheaper but i 'm willing to pay the premium if the toshiba has the same picture quality with 5:5 120hz .
anyone actually have experience with both ?
or should i wait for the sony z series ?
thanks
