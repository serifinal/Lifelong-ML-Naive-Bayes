is it worth getting a samsung 750 over a 650 for only $ 150 more ? .
so i just ordered a samsung ln52a650 , but i realized i could get the 750 version for about $ 150 more .
in your opinion , should i just get the 750 over the 650 ?
from some of the reviews i 've seen , it appears that the 650 actually has slightly higer ratings than the 750 , so i 'm not sure what to do .
