samsung pn50a550 or pn50a650 ??
need help quick please :-rrb- .
hi !
i am about to bite the bullet and wanted to ask people that own one of these or have experienced both in action -- the only reason i an contemplating the 650 is for the supposedly better anti-reflection .
i have a lot of ambient lighting in my house and with the curtains closed on the glass doors that lead to the outside , there should n't be any direct sunlight .
will the 550 be ok in this setup ?
or is it worth spending $ 200 more for the 650 ?
is the picture quality , etc. , exactly the same between the two ?
thanks for any helpful insight ... i want to order this today so i appreciate any immediate feedback !
