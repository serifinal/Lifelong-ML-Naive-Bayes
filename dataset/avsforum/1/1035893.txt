totem tribe vs. morel vario ? .
i 'm looking at on-wall ht speaker options -lrb- space constrained -rrb- .
i 've got a short-list down to the totem tribe i -lrb- l/r -rrb- & 3 -lrb- c -rrb- ; or the morel vario on-wall .
i also looked at the bg radia 17i/18i , although i heard the morel vario were better .
i 'm located in colorado , and having a hard time finding demo locations , although will be out in la in a few weeks so hoping to demo some then .
any recommendations or suggestions between these options , or others that i might have missed ?
