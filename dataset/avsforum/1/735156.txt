is there any way to have more space on my dvr ? .
i have comcast digital cable and their hd package as well as their hd dvr .
the problem is , recording all these hd programs fills the dvr 's space up quick .
is there any way i can , like , put a bigger hard drive in it or something ?
or can i buy a non-comcast dvr such as a tivo and use it with their dvr service ?
i need answers , man .
this extremely limited space is killing me !
