more power . .
new reciever or amp .
i currently have a onkyo 705 , and i just got my new onix rocket setup , but i want more power so my question is .
do i buy a onkyo 805 for 600 bucks and sell the 705 for $ 400 , or keep the 705 and spend $ 400 plus shipping on a used emotiva lpa-1 ?
its obviously way cheaper to buy the 805 and sell the 705 but will the emotiva have that much more power ?
im kinda broke after buying the rockets so id like to save some money if theres not much of a difference thanks
