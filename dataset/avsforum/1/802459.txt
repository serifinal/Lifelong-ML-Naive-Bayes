recommend me a fixed screen please ! .
instead of searching through 1000s of threads i decided to post my own .
i just installed my panny ae3000 and i was going to install a 120 sarria screen thats motorized ... but after testing the panny against the wall , i decided i need something between 125 to 130inch .
so what manufacturers do you guys recommend and how much should a screen of that size cost me ?
im still kind of new to this whole projector scene .
but i want the best bang for my buck , thanks !!!!
