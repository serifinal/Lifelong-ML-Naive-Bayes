buying a stand alone region 2 dvd player or hacking current dvd players ? .
well looks like i will need to buy a region 2 dvd player to view some pal dvds , thing is i heard that current dvd players can be legally hacked to view region 2 dvds , is that true ?
i have a ps2 , ps3 , xbox & a xbox 360 , any chance any of them can be easily modified to play pal dvds ?
i been looking around & the cheapest region free players are going for around $ 100 & only upconvert to 1080i -lrb- i 'm looking specifically for 1080p support -rrb- .
