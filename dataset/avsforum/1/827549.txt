looking for 32-37 '' tv for bedroom . .
as the title suggests , i will be in the market for a 32-37 '' tv for my bedroom .
the set will be primarily used for watching cable tv and dvds .
would be nice if it had a atsc ?
receiver included for getting some hd off of a regular digital cable signal .
viewing distance would be 14-18 feet , but the space for the set is limiting , thereby only looking for 32-37 '' .
lcd or plasma , i do n't care .
under $ 1000.00 if possible .
would like to have before end of the year .
thanks .
mike been out of the loop since i bought my 42 '' plasma three years ago , so your input would be much appreciated .
