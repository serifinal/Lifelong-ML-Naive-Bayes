similar situation .
to anyone who has seen both the samsung pn ** a550 and panasonic ** pz800u , how do they compare ?
i 'm planning to get a 58 inch and am deciding whether to pull the trigger on the samsung now or wait 6 months or so for the panasonic .
sounds like only the smaller sizes of the panny are available now , but any comments would be greatly appreciated .
thanks !
