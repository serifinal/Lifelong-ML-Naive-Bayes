pioneer kuro 5010fd vs samsung ln52a650 -lrb- lcd -rrb- within 100 dollars of eachother . .
i heard the kuro 's are pretty much impervious to burn in , but does this older model do 24p / ect .
or am i better off with the new samsung 52 '' a650 .
i do a lot of gaming , and have had burn in issues , my local bb has the kuro heavily discounted nib .
so idk , i need to make a descision soon .
