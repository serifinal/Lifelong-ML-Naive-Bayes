samsung pn50a450 vs panasonic pz85 .
i 'm looking to get your opinions on which tv to get , the samsung pn50a450 or the panasonic 46pz85 .
the samsung is and the panasonic is .
right now i do n't have a blue ray player to take advantage of the 1080p , but may get one down the road .
screen size they would both be plenty big enough for me .
i guess i 'm a little stuck on this decsion and could use some swaying to one or the other .
thanks .
