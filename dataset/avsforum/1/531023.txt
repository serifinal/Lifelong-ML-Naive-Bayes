samsung model confusion - 650 vs. 750 ? .
what is the big difference -lrb- if any -rrb- between the samsung ln52a650 and the samsung ln52a750 ?
looking at the circuit city website , all i can see is that they picture the 650 with an oval looking base , while the 750 is shown with a rectangular base .
are there any other differences ?
both seem to have the same specs as far as i can see .
i like the rectangular base better , by the way .
is the 750 a good tv to buy ?
