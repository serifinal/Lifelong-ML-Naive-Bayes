.
hi , i have a 32 inch 720p poloroid tv .
i really like the color and that there is no glare , but there is one problem its a little small .
walmart has the deal for a samsung 50 inch 720p plasma or a 42 inch 1080p lcd .
what one should i get ?
i sit about 10 feet away from the tv .
is the samsung going to look good ?
when i went to the store i looked at the plasma 's and they looked very dark .
is this just in the settings or are these the way plasmas are .
what one would you choose thanks in advance !
