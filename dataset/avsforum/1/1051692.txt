panasonic th-c42hd18 vs. samsung pn42a400 .
i am looking to pick up one of these 2 tvs in the next couple days and i am wondering which one people consider the better of the 2 ?
what features does each have that the other does n't ?
if you have owned one or have experience with them , what do you like and dislike about them ?
are either of these older models or brand new ?
which has the better picture quality ?
better audio ?
i wo n't have money for external speakers for a couple months .
is either considered more reliable ?
they are both on sale for the exact same price at 2 different stores and they are my maximum -lrb- actually over -rrb- price by budget , so please do n't suggest another tv even if it is literally $ 50 or $ 100 more .
thanks
