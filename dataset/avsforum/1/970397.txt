niles phd-42 flat panel speakers vs. other flat panel speakers ? .
has anyone auditioned the niles phd-42 flat panel speakers ?
there are no local places that have these speakers to audition and i have not found any reviews yet .
generally speaking , are niles speakers considered good ?
i am trying to find alternative options in my budget -lrb- $ 300 or less per speaker -rrb- for a surround system in my family room .
the following are my options so far : - paradigm cinema 330 -lrb- $ 299 each -rrb- - good sounding , better for movies than music , not sure if i like the plastic enclosure for the price - polk rm7300 flat panel speakers - i bought 5 of these on ebay for my bonus room and think they sound really good for the money .
i am looking for a better speaker , if possible , for my family room than these .
- energy fps take -lrb- < $ 250 each on internet -rrb- - i have not heard this speaker in person , but have always liked the way energy speakers have sounded .
good reviews on internet .
- niles phd-42 flat panel -lrb- < $ 300 each on internet -rrb- - i have not heard this speaker in person , but is the only 3-way speaker of the bunch .
- nht l5 -lrb- < $ 200 each on internet -rrb- - i have not heard this speaker in person .
heard some good and some not so good reviews .
it seems like it might be hard to drive @ 85 db sensitivity rating .
what are the opinions of the options above ?
