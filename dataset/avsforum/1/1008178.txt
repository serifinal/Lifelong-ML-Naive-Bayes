klipsch synergy sub-12 .
i have the following setup : onkyo 805 front speakers : def tech bp7006 -lrb- 2 -rrb- center : def tech c/l/r2002 surround/surround rear l/r : bose cube speakers -lrb- 4 -rrb- subwoofer : old polk audio sub -lrb- bout 8 yrs .
old , ca n't find model # , no manual -rrb- blu-ray : panasonic dmp-bd30k -lrb- dolby truehd & dts-hd master audio via bitstream , arriving tomorrow ! -rrb-
dimensions : roughly 18x25 w / vaulted cathedral ceiling that is very high .
i do n't have a large budget remaining -lrb- bout 500 max -rrb- as my 805 i got last week and my bd30k arrives tomorrow .
however , i realize the importance of a sub to any ht system , and badly want to upgrade my sub as my current one is boomy , old , and simply does n't provide good sound anymore .
if i go over 500 , i will be forced to wait 8 months til i pay off my new player and amp .
i saw/heard the klipsch synergy sub-12 at best buy .
is this a good buy or do i need to live w/o a decent sub for 10 months to get a hsu/av123/etc . .
thanks
