sub for 8500 cu .
ft. room .
i am close to making the final order for home theater equipment in my new house .
i currently have a velodyne f1500r 15 '' sealed servo controlled sub .
i have had it for a while and it has been great , but this new room is larger than anything else i have had and i do n't think it will perform like i want .
it 's time to step up to something bigger and better .
the main area -lrb- living room + kitchen -rrb- is about 18 ' wide , 31 ' deep and a vaulted ceiling up to 12 ' .
this room opens into hallways and other bedrooms etc. .
i have calculated the entire open area to be around 8500 cubic feet .
i have room up front on the screenwall for two subs , and one near the main listening area for near field placement .
i am looking for excellent mid-bass as i have bookshelf - type speakers .
solid extension down to 16hz is crucial for pipe organ music playback .
music performance is paramount .
size or looks does n't really matter ; my wife likes this as much as i do .
budget is up to ~ $ 2000 .
diy is not an option so leave that alone .
i do n't have the time or desire .
the next house -lrb- 3-5 years -rrb- will have an ib so leave me alone about it .
i do n't want to cut holes in this house .
i have looked at the submersive , terraform , th-50 , dts-20 ; stuff like that .
what say you ?
