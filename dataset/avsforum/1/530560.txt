which lcd has the least problems ? .
i am looking for a 32 '' set but can not decide which brand to purchase .
it seem like every one has some problems .
the panasonics have the buzzing sound , samsung 's have the purple haze problem , sharp the banding problem , etc. .
i would prefer 1080p , 120hz .
i want to upgrade to satellite hd soon .
would any owners care to recommend anything ?
