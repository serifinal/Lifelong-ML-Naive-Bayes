panasonic 32lz800 vs sharp 32gp3u - which to choose ? .
hello all ... so i 'm finally going to bump up my -lrb- still relatively new -rrb- 26 '' sony 720p -lrb- not xbr -rrb- set to a 1080p set .
i have very limited space , so the max i can go to is 32 '' .
the two sets that look the best to me are the panasonic 32lz800 and the sharp 32gp3u .
from what i have read here , people rave about the panasonic , but the sharp is also nice -lrb- i like the swivel stand , tho ' getting a tv just for that would be silly -rrb- .
has anyone here seriously investigated both , and found one head and shoulders above the other ?
