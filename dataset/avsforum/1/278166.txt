pz85 vs pz80 .
i am trying to decide b/w a 42 inch pz85 and pz80 .
does the 30k :1 vs. 20k :1 contrast ration make a big difference in pq ?
is there any other big difference in pq or features between the two ?
i do n't think i will e using the pc input too much ?
btw , what does the thx on the 800 do ?
bottomline pricewise : fry 's has the 80 it for 1270 incl tax , shipping & 5 year warranty .
the 85 is 600 bucks more amazon : has 80 for 1100 and 85 for 1180 .
but can not find warranty information .
anybody know how to add warranty to tvs in amazon for panny 's ?
thanks , arvind
