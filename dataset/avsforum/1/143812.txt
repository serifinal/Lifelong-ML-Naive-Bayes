.
i have owned a klipsch synergy speaker setup for almost ten years , and i 'm still driving them with a yamaha rxv-595 -lrb- first dolby digital model ! -rrb-
, still kicking if only at `` 85 watts per channel '' .
i 'm going to stick with the klipsch for a few more years , but of course it 's almost time for a receiver upgrade .
i definitely want minimum 3 hdmi inputs , 7.1 channels -lrb- minimum 110 wpc -rrb- , usb in/networking , `` night listening '' for volume control , lip sync ... hoping to keep it under $ 1500 , so i may have to wait a year .
the real question is , do i want another yamaha ?
i 've always liked the sound , but i was 19 when i bought it and did n't really audition other brands with my klipsch .
i can see what some reviewers mean about the yamaha/klipsch combo being occasionally too bright .
i am very interested in the denon 2809ci / 3808ci , and the pioneer vsx-94txh / vsx-03txh .
thoughts ?
