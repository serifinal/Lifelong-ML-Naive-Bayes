hi all .
i 'm strongly decided on a crt projector .
after doing my research , i know that my room can properly hold a 120 '' screen , and i know that light can be completely removed from said room .
i am strongly set on 1080p .
mostly because it is the strongest standard right now , and if not 1080p , and the ridiculous life of these crt projectors , i might as well get a digital projector -lrb- lighter , smaller , and 720p/1080i -rrb- . .
these are my basic reasons for it .
i also consider it a big deal how these are more along the lines of industrial quality and modular , and this strongly puts me towards crt projectors .
i was looking at the marque 8500 , and the nec xg 1351 lcs for sale on curtpalmes site , but according to his guide , they can handle 1080p alright , just not amazingly , and possibly even softly .
i do not want to plan to get something like this , and then have complaints afterwards after i spent a good deal of money on one .
so i come here , to ask your opinions , thoughts , and other details ... what projector should i get ?
would i be good with a nec xg 1351 lc ... is there a similar alternative that will do this better ?
i must also mention that a while back -lrb- few months ago -rrb- i was asking questions about the marque 8500 , but now that i have the money to spend , i have doubts in my mind that need quelling so to speak .
i appreaciate all input , and thank you ahead of time for putting in the time to respond to my questions . .
