samsung pn50a530 compared to samsung pn50a550 .
i have been reviewing the information/specs on the samsung pn50a550 compared to the pn50a530 plasma tv 's .
the only difference i 've been able to identify is that the pn50a550 has the wiselink -lrb- usb 2.0 -rrb- .
does anyone know of other differences between these two units ?
thank you , cory
