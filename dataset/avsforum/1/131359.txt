response time .
i have been looking around and i have narrowed my selection down to two sets .
i plan on going and purchasing one or the other tomorrow , and i know the manager so i will buy either at cost and not much price difference for me between the two .
in the store they are sitting side by side and each has it 's up and downs .
the toshiba seems to have more color and deeper blacks and definately looks noticably bigger even though it is only 2 inches , while the samsung is definately crazy bright and has mad contast and detail .
overall though they really look extremely similar which is why i 'm having such a tough time deciding , i mean there are slight differences , but absolutely nothing substantial .
personally i think the toshiba frame and overall look of the tv is more pleasing to eye and it is 100 dollars more than the sammy , but at the price of the tv 's this does n't really make any difference to me .
again the tv 's i 'm deciding between are the samsung ln40a530 and the toshiba 42rv530u .
whichever i buy will be hooked up to pioneer surround sound , a pioneer 1080p unconverting dvd player and a xbox360 all at 1080p , and eventually blu-ray to come .
what are your opinions as i know it can be tough to tell in the store since their feed is n't exactly the highest quality ?
i just want the overall best looking and performing tv out of the two because i plan on having it for a very long time
