recommendations for 150 '' power screen please .
i am moving my projector -lrb- panasonic ae2000u -rrb- to a larger room , now looking for a large -lrb- 150 '' diagonal or marginally smaller -rrb- power retractable screen -lrb- ceiling-mounted -rrb- .
this will be my first screen , as so far i was just projecting on a wall .
looking for suggestions on brand / model / fabric / etc. .
thanks !
