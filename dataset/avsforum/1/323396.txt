2.40 masking for 1.85 retractable screen .
does anyone have any suggestions on a temporary masking system for a manual retractable screen .
i was thinking of maybe using velcro to secure a long strip of black velvet across the top and bottom of the screen , then remove them when i need to retract the screen .
this sounds and might look kinda ghetto though .
