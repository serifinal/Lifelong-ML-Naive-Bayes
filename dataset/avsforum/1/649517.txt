panasonic th-42px80u vs samsung hp-t4254 .
for those that have seen both sets , what does each set have over the other ?
my main question , is the panny ~ $ 150 better than the sammy is ?
does one produce better whites and blacks ?
i am looking at about 50/50 hd and sd viewing .
no bashing , i have limited expierence with plasmas , just want some comparison info .
