opinions on totem tribe ii and iiis ? .
hi guys , i 'm interested in the totem tribe ii and iiis mainly for movies and sports .
i did get to audition them and was quite pleased however the place i heard them at could n't set up the tribes with a blue ray player or anything so i was n't able to hear them with movie dialog .
anyone heard them on movies ?
and if there 's a dramatic difference between the iis and iiis ?
thanks .
