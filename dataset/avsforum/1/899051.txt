sharp lc-52d85u reviews ? .
i have found only two reviews on-line , both seemed to like it , but other reviews are scarce .
anybody purchased one , yet ?
it is a price i was waiting for the sony 's and sammy 's to come own to for the super bowl .
i have a pioneer 1018ahk w / energy speakers , so sound is n't important .
i have fios and will be getting a ps3 for christmas .
