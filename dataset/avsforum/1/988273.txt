so what 's up with sony speakers and speaker reviews ? .
well now that i have my home theater projector i 've started looking for a budget surround setup .
i 've been doing some speaker research -lrb- as i 'm a noob -rrb- and checking them out at the local big box stores .
i notice that the sony 3000 bookshelf speakers are on sale at bb -lrb- 79/pr -rrb- and noted the glowing reviews .
now i was always under the impression that sony did n't make good speakers however the reviews say differently .
-lrb- of course none of the stores i visited had the sony 's set up so i could listen to them - and i visited 3 bb and 2 cc -rrb- .
then i noticed something else - every speaker gets glowing reviews .
yes there is the occasional negative review but overall 98 % of every review i 've read for every speaker is very positive , regardless of brand or price .
that leads me to believe that speaker construction has got to a level that even cheap speakers sound good , or that most reviews out there are fake .
any thoughts ?
also - has anyone here listened to the sony 3000 and would they be a good choice for a 5.1 setup for the l/r speakers , with the sony 5000 center ?
probably go with a dayton sub and an onkyo 5.1 receiver .
it 's a small room -lrb- 11x18 -rrb- .
they 'll be used 80 % for movies/tv and 20 % for music .
thanks everyone .
