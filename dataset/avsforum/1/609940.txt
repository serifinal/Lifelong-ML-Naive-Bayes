.
i own a sharp lc42d64u .
when watching standard definition tv -lrb- my provider is dish network -rrb- , a small , thin band of `` static '' -lrb- for lack of a better term -rrb- appears at the top of the picture .
this phenomena does not occur when watching hd programming .
is this an issue with my tv or dish network ?
in either case , is there a known fix ?
