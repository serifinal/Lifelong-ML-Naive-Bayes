asus xonar hdav1 .3 vs xona d2 .
i just picked up a xonar d2 on line for under $ 150 .
for hd-dvd & bluray playback i use tmt & nero .
my receiver hk520 no hdmi , so i use analog inputs .
i feed my sony 42e200 from a msi 8600gts by hdmi .
arcsoft will be supporting dts master audio hd in the next release .
will i really gain anything by returning the xonar d2 and waiting for the asus xonar hdav1 .3 ?
i understand that it will be $ 200 + additional daughter card with rca outputs .
the xonar has been working flawlessly .
i have no plans to purchase a new receiver in the near future .
i tried standalone bluray players sony , samsung , and a panasonic , returned them all due to the fact i get much better playback with my htpc with no issues thanks to anydvdhd .
i been able to play ever disc except jumper , it will play without anydvdhd running , update coming soon .
when using tmt and nero with analogs outs with the xonar d2 , it really sound spectacular .
any opinions or suggestion would be very helpful .
