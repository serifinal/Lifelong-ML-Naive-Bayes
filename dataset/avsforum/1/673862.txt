32 '' samsung a550 vs sony xbr6 .
hey guys i am purchasing a new tv tommorow and need some opinions on which one you would choose .
there is only an 80 dollar difference after my discount that i recieve , so if you were me which would you chose : the xbr6 or the a550 -lrb- both are 32 '' -rrb- .
the 24p interests me but i was wondering if it is worth it or if it is just hyped .
also here is what im going to be doing with it : i have a 360 and hdtv but i do still play many ps2 games on my ps2 with component cables .
i noticed on my other similarly sized lcds that i get a black bar on the sides of my tv -lrb- imagine what 4:3 looks like on a 16:9 tv but shrink the bars on each side until they are about 1-2 inches thick -rrb- in which i have tried every setting imaginable on my ps2 and tv .
i was wondering if that was a video processing problem or just a problem on that sized screen .
thanks for the input !
