having trouble connecting the htpc to my tv .
i got a rca d56w20 56 in .
tv and it supports 1080i , i connect the htpc to the screen and the tv acts like it is the wrong res .
i can view the pc but the screen bleeds over past the edge of the screen , i can not however scroll to those points on the edge like on a pc monitor with the wrong res .
i have tried intel , nivida , and ati cards all with the same result .
i do not have the remote for this tv to reset it to defaults . .
any help would be appreciated .
i am connecting the pc through the dvi port -lrb- which works with my xbox 360 hdmi > dvi cable and looks great -rrb- i have not yet tried through the component cable since i will have to buy the dongle to send component out of my video card .
any thoughts on this ?
