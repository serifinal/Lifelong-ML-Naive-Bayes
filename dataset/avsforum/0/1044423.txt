which is better : sony 40w4100 or sammy 40a650 ?? .
well , im all set to pull the trigger on my new tv purchase .
i was set on the sammy but i found out today that i can get the sony w4100 for about $ 50 - more .
i know the sony is newer , but in reality which is better ??
i have read the cnet review about the a650 's and i know they are terrific tv 's , but i cant help to think that the sony is very good too .
i know it does not have a 10 bit panel -lrb- i hate that -rrb- but besides that , what would you get ??
i need to make my decision today before they run out of stock .
please help !!
