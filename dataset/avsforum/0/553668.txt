over a home network -rrb- 750 can play video off of dlna/usb flash drive .
650 limited to images/audio 750 comes with 1gb internal flash memory pre-loaded with hd pictures , games , recipes , and a few other things 750 's controls on the bezel have a red backlight .
650 's controls have no backlight 750 has a square bezel compared to the 650 's rounded bezel 750 has a square stand compared to the 650 's oval stand 750 stand does not swivel -lrb- contrary to samsung 's literature -rrb- ************ 750 calibration/settings thread link *************** calibration/settings thread ****************************************************** known issues : the ` halo ' effect : some people have noticed that the clear surrounding of the 750 bezel acts as a sort of fiber optic transfer for the screen .
what this means , is that at certain angles , and in certain darker lighting conditions , the bezel will dimly light up with the colors that are on the screen .
this appears somewhat like a ` halo ' encircling the tv .
some people find this hugely distracting , others could n't care less .
it 's up to you to see it and decide for yourself .
this is a purely aesthetic effect as the result of the bezel design and has nothing to do with the electronic hardware .
here 's an example of the effect .
better pictures will be posted as they become available .
notice the glow on the top of the bezel .
as said previously the presence of the effect is very dependant on lighting condition and viewing angle .

what this means is that the 750 series tv 's are able to display streaming content from a computer .
first you must connect the tv to your network .
then you must install the included samsung software on your pc and you should be good to go .
this does not work with the wireless adapter -lrb- sold separately -rrb- .
the dlna network must be connected via a normal broadband networking cable .
-lrb- i.e. cat-5 -rrb- people have reported that the free software tversity -lrb- www.tversity.com -rrb- will also work with the tv and may be somewhat more user friendly .
here are the currently supported file types that the 750 can display : -lrb- more types may be supported .
samsung has stated they 're updating the user manual to reflect all supported file types -rrb- image : jpeg -lrb- .
jpg , .
jpeg -rrb- audio : mp3 -lrb- .
mp3 -rrb- video : -lrb- resolutions are the maximum resolution that file type can be displayed -rrb- wiselink pro explanation : wiselink pro is the tv 's ability to play media stored on a usb flash drive .
to use this feature , simply place the drive in the wiselink usb port located on the side connections panel and then navigate the appropriate menus .
all of the same file types from dlna are supported over wiselink pro .
usb harddrives such as an external hdd or an ipod are not supported .
attach these at your own risk as owners of other models of samsung tvs have reported that trying to access files on these resulted in bricking the tv .
*** note : the ntfs formatting system is not supported .
the drive must be formatted in fat32 .
