need help with onkyo 606 .
so i just spent all my money on my new hobby :--rrb- but i 'm having a big issue .
i bought the onkyo 606 , paradigm monitor 7 fronts , cc-190 center .
using my old sony 's for rears and no sub .
those will be upgraded later when i have money again :--rrb- .
tv is a sony kdf-46e3000 .
now my problem : i use a ps3 for all my playing needs .
blu-ray , dvd , cd , etc. .
it is connected via hdmi , and i 'm having the buzzing problem so many people seem to have .
now without reading 60 pages of talk , is there any known solution to this problem , or should i just give up and go exchange the receiver for a denon/sony ?
i know the speakers are connected properly , the hdmi cable is a very high quality shielded -lrb- friend works for bb so i got monster cables at cost -rrb- .
i want to love my new speakers , but with this buzz i just ca n't .
any help will be appreciated .
