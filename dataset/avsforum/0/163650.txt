antenna help....kdl-40v2500 .
first , please let me apologize if this should be on another board i have a sony bravia kdl-40v2500 lcd tv hooked up outside near my hot tub .
i do not currently have cable hooked up to this tv .
i assumed since it has a built in atsc tuner that i could get ota channels without the help of an external hd antenna .
however , my tv is not receiving either analog or digital signals .
is the built in tuner not strong enough to receive ota channels ?
maybe a setting in the tv is not turned on ?
or do i indeed need to buy an antenna -lrb- preferably indoor as i do not wish to hang an outdoor antenna -rrb- .
i felt i knew quite a bit about hd television but i realize i am very ignorant when it comes to tv 's and antennas .
any help you guys can be would greatly help me out .
