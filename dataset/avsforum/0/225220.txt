hdmi and svideo output at same time .
i have two tvs , and old 32 '' crt with s-video in , and my mitsubishi 720p 1500 projector with hdmi in .
i want my upcoming htpc -lrb- assuming it will be mythbuntu -rrb- to drive them both , because i try to limit using the projector .
and my kids watch all their stuff on the 32 .
is there a vid card with both hdmi and svid out that will work ?
hopefully something that can display on both at the same time .
i do n't want to have to toggle between the two video outputs .
