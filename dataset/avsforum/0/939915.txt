cps or mack - does it matter ? .
i have a few weeks left to pick one of these guys for an ew on my 1150hd .
i 've already decided i want a 3-year ew so that 's not the question .
i 'm wondering if either of these guys ' ts & cs are any better than the other .
does one have coverage for some failure conditions that the other does n't ?
does one have more loopholes to get itself out of having to cover things ?
do they both deal with factory authorized local repair centers ?
i tried going through their respective fine print but it got me discombobulated real quick .
hoping others can enlighten me .
