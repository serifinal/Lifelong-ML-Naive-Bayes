.
i purchased a pioneer elite 1140hd plasma tv from best buy a little under a year ago .
well , about 3 weeks ago i turned on the set first thing in the morning and i saw a white line across the bottom of the screen , then a very loud pop / explosion on the inside of the tv .
i quickly turned the tv off and noticed that there was now a crack .
i called pioneer immediately and they asked me to send pictures of the tv .
i sent them pictures and they said , `` well it looks like a crack from external damage so its not covered '' .
of course thats what it looks like !
i asked them to send someone out to open up the tv to find any internal defects to corroborate my story .
they did , and as i knew they would , they found melted chips .
the tv repair tech stated that the internal meltdown could 've definitely caused the screen to crack .
the tv tech repair sent an email with pictures of the melted chip to pioneer to review so they would authorize a repair or replacement .
at this point i was very happy since i thought this would be enough to validate what had happened to me .
pioneer has refused to acknowledge the manufacturer defect and are claiming they have no proof that the internal damage caused the screen to crack just like i do n't have proof that the crack would n't have caused the internal meltdown of the chip .
basically what they 're saying is that its my word against theirs even though i thought i had proof .
so much for being loyal & honorable .
any help ?
what can i do ?
