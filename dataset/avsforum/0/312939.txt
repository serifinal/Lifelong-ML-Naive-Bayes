running the break-in dvd on the computer instead of dvd player - is this ok ? .
i am still worried about letting the sony blu-ray player to run the break in dvd over night or while i am at work uninterrupted on my pioneer elite 101 .
i am wondering if it is okay to run the break in dvd iso image on a computer hooked up to the panel via hdmi and connected to a uninteruptible power supply ?
has anyone done it before and is it ok to go that route ?
