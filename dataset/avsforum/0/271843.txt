light right in the path of my projector .
i was looking at where my projector might sit , and it seems like i will have ceiling lights that sit right in line with the path of the projected image .
while i will have a light controlled room , would ambient light emitted from that light have any more effect on the image than ambient light from the sides of the room .
meaning if the image is shooting right through a light , would it get any more washed out that it would from lights to the side ?
