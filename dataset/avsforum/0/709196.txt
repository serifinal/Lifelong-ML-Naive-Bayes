odd problem with x-plosion , arcsoft totalmedia theatre , powerdvd and soundmax ad1988a .
have a intel p5b motherboard , with auzentech x-plosion 7.1 cinema , and an ati radeon 3800 series this mb has the soundmax ad1988a as audio chipset - also 7.1 i have powerdvd 8 and totalmedia theatre installed all drivers and software are fully updated the problem is getting reliable 7.1 output from the my htpc , particularly from tmt/x-plosion combo i am outputting via analog to a 7.1 analog in receiver - onkyo sr606 i made the following observations : 1 .
problem decribed here effects both compressed multi-channel formats -lrb- dts , dtsma , ac3 -rrb- , as well as 5.1 and 7.1 lpcm 2 .
when using powerdvd , htpc outputs proper 7.1 analog sound using a bluray disc , whether i use the x-plosion or the soundmax to output 3a .
when using tmt , htpc outputs proper 7.1 sound using a bluray disc , when i use soundmax to output 3b .
but when i use tmt and the x-plosion , it seems as if i get single channel sound from each of the 7 channels i.e. identical signal comes from all 7 speakers .
this sounds terrible with the actor/speakers voice coming from all 7 speakers _________________ i had a basic x-plosion 7.1 also , swapped this in , but same problem .
also tried the previous approved version of x-plosion drivers , same resultls as above so in lay terms , it seems that the `` communication '' between the tmt software/codecs and the x-plosion is flawed - somewhere in sequence , there is an instruction to output combined mono output to all 7 speakers any ideas on how i fix this ?
if i contact tmt tech support , i suspect they will bounce me to auzentech x-plosion support .
when i call auzentech , they will like do the bounce to tmt -lrb- one obvious solution is to stick with the soundmax only , but having purchased the auzentech in belief it might give slightly better analog output , i was hoping to get the x-plosion working -rrb- btw one other observation .
nero 9 seems to suffer from exactly the same problem , altho source in this case was avchd structure with a variety of multichannel audio formats help appreciated jeff
