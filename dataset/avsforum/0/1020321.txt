sales of flat panel tvs are going flat .
http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/te...ref=technology quote : in a reversal of fortune , television sales in the united states are predicted to drop in 2009 , according to a new report from displaysearch , a market research firm .
it would be the first sales decline in at least a decade , said displaysearch , and the first decline in revenue since 2000 .
tv makers have long argued that tvs were recession-proof because americans would continue to buy them as a cheap way to entertain their families .
but consumers are now starting to shun the lcd and plasma sets , even as prices fall sharply .
in 2009 , sales of all types of tvs in north america are predicted to decline by 4 percent .
lcd tv sales are expected to increase in north america by 2 percent over 2008 , a fraction of the 22 percent gain in 2008 and the 77 percent rise in 2007 .
i think some of the greedy companies need to take a serious look at this forecast .
especially the arrogant companies that keep manufacturing and marketing overpriced displays that are not selling .
