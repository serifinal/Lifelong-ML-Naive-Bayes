noob needs suggestions for first surround sound set up to go with non-elite kuro .
hi guys , i know there are a lot of threads about this but i had trouble finding one that matched up and was recent . .
i just picked up a pdp-5020fd and i love it .
i like the speakers on it too and i was wondering if i could incorporate those into a surround sound system ?
like i said , i 'm completely new to this .
i play games and watch movies mostly . .
the system would be used occasionally for playing background music for a party , but i do n't need anything that would blow you away because i 'm living in an apartment for the next 2-3 yrs .
the -lrb- living -rrb- room with the tv has a 10ft viewing distance & has 1 semi-open wall -lrb- the right side -rrb- .
the width is like ~ 16-20 ft. i definitely want to be able to tell if ppl are sneaking up from behind in games , but i 'm completely flexible with the set up -lrb- 5.1 , 7.1 , surround bar -rrb- as long as it can do that . .
i 'm thinking about spending up to $ 1500 .
i know there are a lot of these posted all the time , but i 'd really appreciate any useful input you have !
could i implement my tvs speakers in a system ?
is there a huge difference between surround bars and actual surround systems ?
how about the 5020fd speakers vs a surround bar ?
thanks !!
