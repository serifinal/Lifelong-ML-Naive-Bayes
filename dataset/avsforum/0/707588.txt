noob looking to build first speakers .
i am completely new to building speakers .
i have woodworking experience and a little electronics .
i currently have some very old and crappy bose acoustamass speakers that i bought when i was young and did n't know any better .
the only plus about the bose is that they are tiny and that has a high waf .
the center channel is so weak we can hardly hear the dialog without cranking the rest .
i was wondering if anyone can recommend some kits for surround speakers with center channel that are small like the bose or close to that size .
if there are different kits for l & r compared to c that is cool .
i also plan to build a sub kit later as well .
any recommendations and advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated .
thanks .
