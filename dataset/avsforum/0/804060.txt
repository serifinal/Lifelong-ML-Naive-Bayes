what is this effect ?
seeing green lines edit : rainbow effect .
i have a samsung t5687s dlp and whenever i watch it , i see green lights flashing on some edges .
it 's really hard to explain , but it seems to happen between frames , on the edges where a light color meets a dark color .
sometimes i 'll also see red flashes too , but not as often as green .
it also seems to happen when i look from one side of the screen to the other -lrb- while my eyes are moving -rrb- .
is there something i can adjust to get rid of this ?
i remember seeing the same thing on my old roommates rca 50 '' non-dlp , but it 's not as bad as mine .
definitely puts a strain on my eyes .
please help !
i do n't want to have to send this thing back .
