taking the shine off the dark knight -lrb- aka `` those box-office grosses '' -rrb- .
from http://www.weeklystandard.com/conten...5/567dkyzd.asp the most discussed box office story of the summer was the enormous success of the dark knight , the batman movie that , we were told incessantly , has made more money than any film in history besides titanic .
only , in point of fact , it has n't .
the only honest way to compare the grosses of the dark knight with those of past blockbusters is to measure them in constant dollars .
by that standard , the dark knight 's $ 500 million in domestic box office places it a mere 29th on the all-time box office list ; it is bested , surprisingly , by movies like the sting , thunderball , and grease .
-lrb- using this method of measurement , by the way , titanic is only the sixth most popular film of all time ; gone with the wind actually tops the list with earnings of $ 1.4 billion in 2008 dollars , followed by star wars , the sound of music , e.t. , and , of all things , the ten commandments . -rrb-
