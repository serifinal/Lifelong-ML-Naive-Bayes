how to get spider off of crt ! .
at least i think it 's the crt .
it started crawling across the entire screen , and decided to settle right in the middle .
i 'm pretty sure it 's the crt , and not the screen .
i pushed the screen back and it looked as if it was being projected , despite looking like it was right on the screen .
any suggestions ??
i 'm hoping not to have to take the stupid screen off .
is there an easy way to get to the crt 's , or perhaps a shortcut way of getting this stupid thing off of my screen ?
i tried strategies like turning the contrast up - not working so far .
