quote : director : blu-ray offers better pix than theater the step up 2 director says more detail can be seen .
washington , d.c. -lrb- june 9 , 2008 -rrb- -- since the advent of high-definition tv , film buffs have debated whether it offers a better picture than what can be seen in your local movie theater .
however , jon m. chu , director of the disney hit step up 2 the streets , believes the argument should now cease : the blu-ray high-def disc wins by a mile , he says .
in an article by home media magazine , chu says next month 's release of the blu-ray edition of step up 2 will offer far more detail than the theatrical print .
&#8220; it &#8217; s beautiful , &#8221; chu says of the blu-ray disc version .
&#8220; the colors just pop .
you get to see because we play a lot in the shadows .
that &#8217; s what we wanted to do and sometimes the print was a little dark to me . ''
he added : `` on the blu-ray , just consistently you know what you &#8217; re getting and you can play in those shadows .
you can see it and it doesn &#8217; t feel dark .
it just feels moody .
&#8221; chu even worries that the blu-ray disc will offer too much detail and , consequently , the director says the production team took great care to eliminate potential mistakes unseen by the moviegoer .
&#8220; well , you definitely get to see more wires from the camera , &#8221; chu said .
&#8220; there &#8217; ll be like a sandbag or something somewhere -lrb- on the set -rrb- .
