samsung ln40a550 - should i buy the extended warranty ??? .
i just spent 4 hours on the samsung lnxxa550 calibration forum .
people seemed to have a number of issues , so now i 'm nervous .
factory warranty is 1 year .
extended warranty is for 5 years , in home , for $ 150 .
opinions/thoughts/advise ?
thank you .
