why is my cpu usage so high .
hey all .
my htpc is really getting me down .
i 'm using winxp and nero right now just to play around until i get the upcoming asus hdmi audio card .
i was having an issue where when i ran nero show time with dvd and hardware acceleration on , the screen was all distorted .
i fired off a message to xvx tech support and they suggested i re install my chipset drivers .
i did this and it worked .
here si the problem though .
the screen is clear until the movie gets past the screen that shoes the movie studio logo , then it freezes .
so basically it plays for about 10 seconds .
i did ctrl-alt-del to end it and noticed my cpu usage was at 99 % so i 'm guessing that it 's the overloading of the cpu that caused the freeze .
i restarted the computer and when it 's at idle , with nothing running , just the desktop , cpu usage is at 80 % !
no wonder i ca n't even play a dvd .
unfortunately i do n't know what the usage was at before i updated the drivers but i ca n't see that causing this issue .
there are no applications running , 28 processes running in the back ground , and pcu temp is 39deg .
any idea what could be causing this ?
the computer i 'm on right now is running 48 processes and cpu usage is at 6 % .
it 's a p4 3.2 ghz .
i 'm tempted to wipe the whole thing out and start over with a clean install .
thanks allot everyone .
