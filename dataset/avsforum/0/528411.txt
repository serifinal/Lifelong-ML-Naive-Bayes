.
i just replaced the color wheel on my samsung dlp -lrb- hl-p5063w -rrb- because of the grinding noise .
the tv comes on and the grinding has gone away but , the blue colors are now brown .
the picture is very distorted and doesnt look right at all .
could this be a bad color wheel or did i do something wrong ?
i appreciate any advice you guys can share !
