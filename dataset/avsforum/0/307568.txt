arcsoft tmt - dd over spdif with mkv or m2ts .
all , does anyone have dolby digital + or dolby digital correctly sent via spdif to their receivers ?
tmt always downgrades to 2 channell sterio for me and only passed 5.1 when i tried using a dvd rip with dolby digital ex on it .
what am i missing ?
what am i doing wrong ?
i have spdif selected in the drop down and i have tried both enable mixer and disable mixer .
thanks
