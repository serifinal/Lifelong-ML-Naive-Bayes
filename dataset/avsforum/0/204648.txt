advice on 5.1 or 7.1 for corner tv .
ok , i finally bought a house and figured it was time to get my fun room setup .
i 've been reading over the speaker placement forums and the ' 101 guide ' and have found conflicting answers on how to handle a room like mine .
i do n't really have an option other than putting the tv in the corner and the couches opposite of it because of where the wall openings are .
i was all gung-ho to get 7.1 implemented but i see a fair number of people posting that it would be better to just have a 5.1 system than a 7.1 system that has bad speaker placement .
also , i have vaulted ceilings that go from 8-15 feet in height .
here is what i was originally thinking -lrb- speakers are in red -rrb- .
will i be able to get good sound out of a speaker placement like this ?
i tentatively plan to get a polk lsi/c for the center -lrb- on a shelf above the tv -rrb- and a pair of lsi/7 or 9 's for the fronts .
not sure on the surrounds or sub at this point .
if it matters , i have a pioneer vsx-03txh for my receiver and a 73 '' mitsubishi dlp .
thanks in advance !
matt
