audio problems with intel g45 and hdmi .
i have built a htpc using an asus p5q-em board .
the hdmi output of the pc is connected to a denon 3808 with a 5.1 speaker setup .
everything works perfectly fine , but i hear artifacts in the audio .
it is difficult to describe ... it sounds like a slightly scratched vinyl record .
every few seconds i hear a tick in one of the speakers .
this is totally random and independent from the media i am playing : mp3 , movies , internet radio ... it does not matter .
it all has the same problem .
my dvd player , ps3 and satellite receiver also work fine with the denon .
when i switch the pc audio hardware from hdmi audio to the realtec hd chip the sound is ok , but then the audio is not transported to the denon via hdmi .
i run xp , latest intel drivers on the htpc , upgraded the denon firmware , read articles and postings for the last two days , but i am stuck .
any advice ?
thanks in advance !
