.
here 's what i got : 2.1 altec lansing computer speakers with the sub two bookshelf polk audio speakers kenwood vr-605 receiver playstation 3 samsung ln32a330 hdtv is it possible to hook up the computer speaker jack to my receiver that only has holes for speaker wire for inputs ?
i want to use the polk bookshelf speakers as my front left and right , and use the smaller computer speakers as rear left and right .
but actually the altec lansing vs4121 's sound so good that they can be interchangable .
i really want to be able to do this because if it works , i can save a lot of money , and i know it will sound good enough .
the main thing is that i do n't want to buy a separate sub .
