did anyone ever get to the bottom of the weid flicker issues in 2008 panasonics ? .
i was just curious if anyone ever got an anser or a fix on that odd flickering on certain scenes -lrb- this is not in reference to the 48hz mode btw -rrb- .
i mean i noticed it quite a few times already , but as i 've had them operate on my tv enough just to get a panel without dead pixels i 'm inclined to want to know if anyone really got the issue solved or not .
