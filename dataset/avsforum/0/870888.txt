build thread . .
*** i decided to a a `` current progress '' picture to my first post *** so , here we go .
i 'm not sure the wife knows what i 've gotten her into , but she will soon .
i 'd absolutely welcome any comments and unsolicited advice for this project as i 've never come close to anything of the scope .
i 've done plenty of reading here for a number of years but i think until you get your hands dirty it 's hard to really visualize the process .
notes : 1 .
i plan on doing as much soundproofing as possible : gg , dd , rsic on the ceiling .
2 .
component so far : - paradigm studio 60 , studio cc , studio adps , studio 40 's -lrb- rears -rrb- .
- onkyo 805 - easybutton ixl 18 '' , behringer ep2500 , behringer eq - ps3 , xbox360 , htpc - no projector selected yet - screen will be an at one in the false wall .
originally i had planned a laminate diy screen , but i think i am switching this .
i 'll add some pictures soon , but i 'm hoping that the experts here can help me with some questions before i go to hd tomorrow to take advntage of a sale : 1 .
is it easy to frame a double drywall style wall under a beam and amongst the beam support posts ?
2 .
if i am doing dd/gg and weaving the insulation in between the studs , how do i decide what width of insulation i use ?
my understanding is that roxul safe n sound is the best way to go here ?
3 .
i will framing over the storage area , so do i need a dd/gg wall all along that length ?
-lrb- the north wall -rrb- .
4 .
should i just get a standard 6 ' 8 '' door ?
i have a full eight feet under the joists and 7 ' 3 '' under the beam in which i might integrate the on the south side of the theater area .
5 .
any reason to not use dri core ?
i 'm willing to give up the 7/8 '' for a comfortable floor .
i 'm sure i 'll have a ton more questions !
