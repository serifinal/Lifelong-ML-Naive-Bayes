cutting basement floor to run conduit - is this a diy project or not ? .
i am considering redesigning my riser and that would require me to place a conduit in the existing basement concrete .
the max run would be 8-10 feet .
has anyone done this , if so do you have any tips ?
i have tried searching the forum , but after reading for 35 minutes , i did not see anything applicable .
help me gurus ... help me .
