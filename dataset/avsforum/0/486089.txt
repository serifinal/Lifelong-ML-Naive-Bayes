bipole/dipole or direct radiating speakers for read and side surround speakers ? .
i know this depends entirely to room layout et cetera but ... 1 -rrb- in a 7.1 system , which one would you prefer , for ; a -rrb- side speakers , and b -rrb- rear speakers ?
if you prefer dipole/bipole speakers -lrb- either for sides or rears or for both -rrb- , then please indicate which option do you prefer for which ?
such as dipoles for sides and bipoles for rear , or vice versa , or the same option for both .
2 -rrb- as far as i know , one of the advantages of bipole/dipole speakers is that they can be a bit closer to you and to the back wall , right ?
is this true for if you switch to bipole and dipole or only for one of them ?
ps .
if you want , you may give an answer for both movie watching and music listening .
thanks !
