my dream receiver , when will they make it ? .
we can dream , right ?
when i 'm elected king , we 'll be able to buy one of these : my modest home home theater has five hdmi sources and just a single `` legacy '' component video source .
i ca n't remember the last time i had a svideo connector in use , much less a composite video source .
who on earth needs a receiver with eight svideo/analog inputs ?
it 's time for receiver manufacturers to join us here in the 21st century and stop being stingy with hdmi inputs !
