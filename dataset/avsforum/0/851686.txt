the shirley street theater construction thread .
heres where i will post updates on my theater .
the screen is a used pvc 16x9 screen shortened to 12x8 .
its made from 1Â 1/2 pvc .
the 2 legs are 2 inch pvc hammered close to 3 feet deep .
the screen frames sits inside the legs and can be removed for storage -lrb- the legs stay -rrb- .
the screen will be a canvas drop cloth from either home depot or lowes .
