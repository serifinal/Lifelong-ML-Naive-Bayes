calling all xa2 experts , please help me figure out what kind of hd dvd player i have .
i purchased a refurbished xa2 from bidtopia -lrb- read : bargainland -rrb- in 3/08 .
it has played flawlessly since i got it .
i was going to update it to version 2.7 and that is when i noticed that mine is version 2.0 -lrb- see screenshot -rrb- .
the thing is i did n't know there was a version 2.0 for the xa2 .
i burned the 2.7 disk myself but the machine would n't update .
i thought i burned a coaster so i tried to update to 2.8 with a factory toshiba disc .
it would get to step 2/5 then flash an error code and eject the disk .
i called toshiba and they sent me another 2.8 update disc thinking the first one was bad .
same problem as before .
then , toshiba refused to exchange the xa2 for another refurb because bidtopia is not an approved seller/reseller .
at a loss , i compared the setup menu between my bidtopia xa2 and my ubid xa2 that i had and noticed they were different .
the outside , back , remote , box etc. are identical to my ubid xa2 but the setup menus are different .
what gives ?
i then tried to update the bidtopia xa2 via the internet thinking that no matter what kind of hd dvd player i really had , it would update properly .
no luck .
it would get through all of the initial downloads and then flash the same error code on step 2 of 5 .
one question i have is do the setup menus change based on the version the player is on ?
i 'm hoping someone on here has had a similar experience or can figure out what is going on .
thanks in advance for any insight .
