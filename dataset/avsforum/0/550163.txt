is more gloss the only reason the 71 's amp is more extreme than 650 .
i went to ciruit city in new braunfels , tx and they had the 650 playing pirates of the carribean on blue ray .
it defiantly was a step down from the 71 as far as `` soap opera look '' or the extreme amp look when you crank both of them up .
i ask the rep there why was that the case and did samsung tone the amp down and he basically said no .
he told me the reason the 71 looked more extreme was only due to the extra glossy screen they had and it had nothing to due with there amp .
also he said the 120hz isnt what give it the soap opera look it was something else that went with it .
i couldnt remember the last part though only him mentioning about why the 71 looked more extreme with the auto motion plus .
i dont know but i was wondering what some of you guys thought about it .
