painted screen for mitsubishi hc5500 .
hi , i just bought a mitsubishi hc5500 projector and want to project it onto a screen painted on my wall .
the screen wall will be black , but the other walls will be light colored .
the ceiling will be a drop ceiling and the first row of tiles along the screen wall will be black , but the rest will be white .
i have total light control in my room , so ambient light wo n't be a big deal .
now for my question , what color should i paint the screen ?
i have read that using a gray paint will increase the perceived contrast , but it also requires a very bright projector .
is there a way to increase the gain in gray paint to accommodate this ?
should i just use a white paint ?
thanks for any help you can give me !
