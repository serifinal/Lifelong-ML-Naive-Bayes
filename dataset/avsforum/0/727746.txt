help burn in . .
i bought a pioneer 5010 about a week back .
the manager of the store said it was fresh out of the box , never used as a display unit .
but , i figured it had been a display unit at one point in time .
so i never did a dvd burn in .
the picture is always perfect .
i just got home from a trip and attempted to use my laptop hooked up to the tv using a dvi cable .
i watched some youtube videos for the last 20-30 minutes .
when i turned the laptop off and went to other inputs i could still see the task bar on the dark screen , it is very subtle , but i know it shoul n't be there .
will this just go away as i watch other shows tommorow .
is it burned in ?
what can i do to fix it ?
no more laptop for this plasma ?
should i run the dvd burn in , or is this common with any image displayed for 20-30 minutes on the screen ?
