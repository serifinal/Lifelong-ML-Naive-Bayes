how do you get ps3 to turn off by itself after downloads ? .
i thought with the latest firmware the ps3 would turn off automatically after downloads have finished from the psn store .
well i ca n't find anywhere to activate this .
i have looked in the energy saving settings in the main settings section but it only gives you option to turn off if unused for 1 hour or more .
any ideas ?
