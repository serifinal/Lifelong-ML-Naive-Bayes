i 'm about to gut my theater and rebuild it .
update : the room is done .
to jump directly to pictures of the completed room , click here : http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...4&postcount=73 my current ht started off as the leftover space from my basement finishing , that i throw my old big screen tv into .
it started off like this : i then decided to create a false front wall to make it look sort of like a small movie screen .
it then became this : i then decided i wanted the whole room to have acoustical treatments , and look more like a dedicated room .
so it then became this : well my tv recently had an issue , so best buy 's extended warranty got me a new tv .
they 've giving me an in store credit for a new tv , which i 'm using to buy an optoma hd71 .
if i was smart , i would just do the necessary wiring for the projector , and redo the front wall .
but i 'm getting a little tired of the way it looks , so i thought i would just completely redo it .
i am using this theater -lrb- avs user named `` hed '' -rrb- as inspiration : my room is very small -lrb- current size is 11 ` wide x 16 ' long but i 'll be expanding into the 8 ' wide x 5 ' long behind the rear columns -rrb- , so it wo n't look as good as this one , but i 'm going to try my best .
i 'm going to build a stage , have a 16:9 110 '' screen .
i 'm going to add side surrounds to go from 5.1 to 7.1 , and i 'm going to put a small riser behind the current theater seating and try to find a black leather 2 seater couch that matches .
the rear columns will then be behind it .
the equipment rack will be built into the rack in the wall behind the current seats .
i hope to get my building materials this weekend , and get a good chunk of it done .
wish me luck !
