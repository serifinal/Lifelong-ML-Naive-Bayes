*** scroll down for calibration reports time to start a stand alone owners thread for this model now that people are starting to get them in hand and installed .
so if you own the 141 take some pictures and post your impressions here .
maybe the 141 vs 151 thread could be merged here , but a `` vs '' thread is not what i am interested in nor is it the purpose of this thread .
this is a stand alone 141 owners thread .

you have to calibrate all sub-levels ... meaning difference input types -lrb- 1080p/60 , 1080p/24 , 1080i , 720p , 480p , 480i , etc -rrb- while i totally recommend using controlcal or getting a pro to calibrate your display since pioneer does not allow you to have access to all adjustments this way , buts its still interesting to know how you can access the isf mode via your web browser .
this works on both euro and north american units .
quote : originally posted by andrewfee on the european models -lrb- krp-m -rrb- i found that you can get into the isf section by logging into the regular web interface and then going to : your_kuro_ip '' target = '' _ blank '' > http://your_kuro_ip/cgi/isf.cgi as this bypasses the password page .
the options available are : quote : originally posted by turbe ez hours : enter this in your browser -lrb- internet explorer recommended -rrb- http://monitor_ip_address/cgi/service_right.cgi networking info : -lrb- here is what i did -rrb- *** anyone in my area who would like to hire a networker that is familiar with setting this feature up please send me a pm and ill pass on his info 1 . -rrb-
bought apple aiport express 2 . -rrb-
connected 141 to the network -lrb- hired computer networker -rrb- 3 . -rrb-
once connected i was able to access all the control menus excpet for isf mode which requires a password .
see above for how to access .
4 . -rrb-
setting up the email function was a little tricky .
my best guess is that what you are required to enter is in fact labled wrong .
------ i did not need to put in an id or password ----- `` mail server smtp '' is actually for the mail server ip address ----- `` sender address '' is for your email address ----- there is no dns built into the email 5 . -rrb-
once you get your ip address for the display type it into the browser .
the manual suggests you should only use internet explorer , but i can confirm you can also use safari .

here is a list of wall mounts which work with this display .
sanus vmpl3 : comes with low profile -lrb- 1.5 '' -rrb- and tilting attachment -lrb- 2.5 -rrb- .
you use one or the other .
