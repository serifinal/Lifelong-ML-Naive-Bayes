samsung 750 series usb hard drive refresh .
i have an external hard drive hooked up to my samsung television .
i constantly update my external with new photos and videos , but the television still recognizes old file names and deleted files .
i have 75 gigs of media , is it that it takes a while to refresh ?
or is there a another option to speed this up ?
thanks so much !
