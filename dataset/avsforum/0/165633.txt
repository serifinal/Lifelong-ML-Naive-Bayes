need help with antenna in remote area .
we have a channel master cm3671 and cm7778 set up on our property near clare michigan to get the football games etc. when we 're up there camping .
we have a 19 '' hdtv and an old voom satellite box that we use as a digital tuner .
it all runs on a generator as there is no electricity , plumbing , buildings , anything .
we do have the basics though ... food , shelter , tv .
this was all put together on the cheap as it gets used on a limited basis .
we 've lived with mostly analog for a few of the big networks but that needs to change or we have to find an alternative .
the cost of the solution has to be considerably cheaper than the backup plan which is to buy a satellite dish/box and pay for service a couple months out of the year .
we 're very close to getting the major networks out of flint .
which is about 55 miles to the south east .
we can watch abc in full hd glory but the signal drops out so much that it 's actually better to watch it in analog .
i think our problems are twofold .
first , the antenna is only about 8 ' above the ground .
we 've attached a 10 ' piece of 1Â 1/2 '' conduit to a post that was already there .
it 's very stable but not very tall .
second , there is a stand of at least 40 ' pine trees 75 ' to the west .
it 's about 100 ' wide and about a 1/4 mile long , running north-south .
it 's essentially a wall of trees .
from what i 've been reading , i 'm thinking there might be some multi-path interference from the trees .
i 'm planning on being up there next weekend with the intention of doing something about the antenna .
i can move it about 75 ' to the east to get it further away from the trees or i can come up with some way to raise the antenna up another 10 ' .
what 's going to give me the best chance at bagging those stations ?
what 's going to do me the most good ?
