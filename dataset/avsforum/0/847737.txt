cablevision stb turns itself off at night .
every few nights , after midnight , my scientific atlanta 4250hd does a firmware upgrade , then powers down .
of course , this renders the ir blaster inputs from my two replaytv 5040s useless , and they record black screens for a couple of hours .
the word `` bypass '' appears on the led display of the sa4250 .
the volume also goes to half volume .
very irritating .
i called customer support at cablevision , and they did n't have any fixes in mind .
they will forward the problem to engineering .
i told them i 'd go back to directtv if they could n't fix this problem .
i recently took back the two dvrs they gave me .
they would go into standby every night to save hard disk space .
anyone have any ideas ?
thanks .
