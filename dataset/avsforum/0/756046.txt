free ao 's .
i was wondering if anyone had any input on this one ... i just moved to socal and called time warner cable -lrb- not a huge fan at all ... but it is the only non-satellite option -rrb- to get cable and internet setup .
i have had them before in nc , and other companies when i lived else where , so i am familiar with their pricing .
i went with the hd dvr and road runner turbo .
however , i was just told that for each additional tv that i want to have cable -lrb- no box ... just coaxial from wall to tv -rrb- requires a $ 15 per tv hook up fee .
every other place i have lived you pay a hook up fee for the tv 's that get cable boxes , but never for those that you just plug directly into the wall .
can anyone confirm this is correct ?
does the `` installer '' actually do anything to turn these outlets on that warrants a $ 15 per tv charge ?
or , is this just a scam to get more money ?
if i do n't pay the $ 15 per tv charge will the other outlets in the house not work ?
is there something i can do instead to get this outlets turned on after he does the `` install ? ''
thanks in advance for any input , and i apologize if this has been addressed but i could n't find another thread that dealt with this .
