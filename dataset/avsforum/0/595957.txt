riser as bass trap - still in or out ? .
refering back to the old de article in ht builder , the riser can be used as a broadband bass trap .
apparently , it can be used as a helmholtz resonator as well .
i 'm just interested in the nonspecific broadband basstrap possibilities .
the riser is 14.5 ft wide x 8ft long x 12 inches high .
it is filled with r38 insulation and is to be covered with 3/4 inch tongue in groove osb glued and screwed .
no buttkickers , no sub on the riser .
the original de article has roughly 9 openings cut out into the top of the riser along the sidewalls and backwall .
these openings are covered with 4x10 inch vents .
is this technique still in vogue/valid ?
should the naked fiberglass exposed by the 9 - 4x10 openings in the riser top be covered with gom or other fabric to minimize the chance of glass fiber floating out into the room air ?
