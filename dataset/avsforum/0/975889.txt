's repair epicure mod5 's - bose acoutimass 5 series iii in ht setup .
hello can anyone help me repair my 1989 epicure model 5 's ?
i have one blown tweeter , one blown woof and both woofs have ripped foam ?
i tried to email the humanspeakers guy - but no response .
these were great in their day - want to use them as front or side/rear channels in ht setup .
i was hoping i could just buy new woofers/tweeters and pop em in - i am handy w / tools - but no electrical whiz . .
i do want to try to equal the original sound and keep them running on my new reciever -lrb- not purchased yet but likely an onkyo tx sr606 -rrb- .
i also have 5yr old bose acoustimass 5 series iii 's - this is one sub w / two satellies -lrb- two spkrs/satellite -rrb- .
i want to use them w / my new ht reciever but it seems the sub will just end up as a pass through .
anythoughts on what to do w / this - sell it and put proceeds to a new sub and sats ?
any help is appreciated .
