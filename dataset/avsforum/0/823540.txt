.
so i was watching this blu-ray and i already know what to expect about the style and look of the movie .
btw this movie is a musical a reminder to those who thinks its jack sparrow swinging those blades i really enjoyed this movie version i 'm already familiar with this movie having seen it twice on broadway -lrb- do n't ask -rrb- and owning the soundtrack with angela lansbury as mrs. lovett -lrb- check out the performance in youtube -rrb- .
i can tell you now that its not shoot 'em up in pq .
even though both are sharp and detailed .
sweeney todd is much more inconsistent .
the pq fluctuates from excellent to very good .
minor dnr is applied as well .
the dark scenes is where we lose some of the details .
this happens especially when sweeney first met mrs lovett .
there is also some weird `` ringing '' in the backgrounds .
both day and night scenes .
i do n't think some of these issues are noticeable in most calibrated viewing sets but they are noticeable on mine .
the grainy picture -lrb- filmakers intent -rrb- is good in hiding these artifacts so it may not be problematic to some .
judging from early reviews where its mostly positive it looks like their equipment ca n't resolve some this pq issues .
good for them hmm what else ?
... .
oh yeah the digital airbrushing applied to depp for every close up on most scenes !
in resident evil 3 from blu-ray this was also applied to ms. jovovich so weird on sweeney code : total video title codec length movie size disc size bitrate bitrate main audio track secondary audio track ----- ------ ------- -------------- -------------- ------- ------- ------------------ --------------------- sweeney todd vc-1 1:56:22 29,153,937,408 45,585,051,868 33.40 23.83 dolby truehd 5.1 3339kbps -lrb- 48khz/16-bit -rrb- dd ac3 5.1 640kbps playlist report : name : 00000 .
