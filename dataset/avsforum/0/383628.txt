.
i have a us tv and want to connect it to my sky box atm the tv goes its going through my media center via hdmi which in turn connects to my sky box but i want to connect it directly to the tv .
my tv is hp lc2600 -lrb- specs on amazon -rrb- when i try i only get a black and white signal , would upgrading to sky hd fix this problem ?
since the tv has a hdmi socket .
thx graham
