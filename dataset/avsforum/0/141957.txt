ati 45xx , bit perfect , and vista .
hi , i 'm now the happy owner of an ati 4550 .
i have installed the catalyst drivers -lrb- 8.12 , the latest i think -rrb- , and the realtek high defitinion audio drivers -lrb- 2.0.3 -rrb- .
i 've managed , as well , to get dts and ac3 trhough the hdmi to my receiver -lrb- a marantz sr4001 -rrb- .
lpcm * seems * to be working as well -lrb- tried it with powerdvd -rrb- , although i 'm not that sure .
the receiver does show all the pcm channels being sent though .
now , i 'm trying to get bitperfect .
i think i ; ve managed to get pcm stereo to my receiver when using foobar 2k and the wasapi component -lrb- the vista volume slider stops working -rrb- , but when i try to play a dts wav file -lrb- ie , 44khz -rrb- , all i get is noise -lrb- again , using foobar and wasapi -rrb- .
i can see in the configuration of the hdmi device that it can output 48khz and 44khz -lrb- as well as other formats -rrb- , but i do n't know if that 's for real .
i would like this to work , as i have another audio board installed just to get this , and working fine -lrb- a riviera with cmedia drivers -rrb- , but i 'd like to have everything going through one cable , so that i do n't have to switch between inputs -lrb- and i could use that audio board somewhere else ! -rrb- .
did any of you managed to get bitperfect output with this ati card ?
thanks , - n.
