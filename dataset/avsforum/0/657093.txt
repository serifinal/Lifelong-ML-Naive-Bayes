faint line at top of my tv screen ? .
i 've just watched the r2 copy of `` the texas chain saw massacre '' the beginning and there 's a very faint line that runs across the top of my lcd screen about 2 inches from the top .
does anyone know what 's caused this ?
it shows up both on my blu ray player and my dvd player .
i tried another disc after but it 's not there .
so that leaves me to believe it 's either on the disc -lrb- perhaps something to do with the 1:85 ? -rrb-
or my tv .
does anyone have any idea 's ?
thanks .
