choice of wood in interior door : ranking by density .
i 've done quite a bit of google searching and these forums , and the general consensus is : `` buy solid wood door , no paneling if possible , and have it mounted on an exterior frame '' .
that 's pretty easy .
and then the next part makes it a bit more complicated : the greater the mass -lrb- i.e. density -rrb- the better the acoustical barrier .
ok , cool .
so of the 9 common woods interior hardwood doors are made of , which is the heaviest and thus best ?
i believe `` white oak '' may be the heaviest , but here are the other common types .
i 'm going to try and rank them based on the density ratings i found , but if someone has experience here with regard to mass and density of various wood types -lrb- does n't have to be with doors , persay , i 'd appreciate it -rrb- .
to get technical , i perused this pdf : http://www.woodweb.com/resources/woo...dbook/ch04.pdf quote : the speed of sound in a structural material is a function of the modulus of elasticity and density .
in wood , the speed of sound also varies with grain direction because the transverse modulus of elasticity is much less than the longitudinal value -lrb- as little as 1/20 -rrb- ; the speed of sound across the grain is about one-fifth to one-third of the longitudinal value .
for example , a piece of wood with a longitudinal modulus of elasticity of 12.4 gpa -lrb- 1.8 ?
106 lbf/in2 -rrb- and density of 480 kg/m3 -lrb- 30 lb/ft3 -rrb- would have a speed of sound in the longitudinal direction of about 3,800 m/s -lrb- 12,500 ft/s -rrb- .
in the transverse direction , modulus of elasticity would be about 690 mpa -lrb- 100 ?
103 lbf/in2 -rrb- and the speed of sound approximately 890 m/s -lrb- 2,900 ft/s -rrb- .
the speed of sound decreases with increasing temperature moisture content in proportion to the influence of these variables on modulus of elasticity and density .
the speed sound decreases slightly with increasing frequency and amplitude of vibration , although for most common applications this effect is too small to be significant .
there is no recognized independent effect of species on the speed of sound .
variability in the speed of sound in wood is directly related to the variability of modulus of elasticity and density .
after a half-bottle of wine my eyes crossed trying to come up with a formula to plug those numbers in -lrb- i 'm fairly certain we 'd want transverse , as doors are n't mounted on their side -rrb- .
so , with apologies to math majors , i looked up the modules of elasticity and specific gravity at 12 % moisture content , and plugged it into excel .
here 's how the speed of sound worked out .

the oak stuff is crazy heavy , maple is mid-weight , and cherry is beautiful and wonderfully light .
ok , so i hope this is helpful to people .
it pretty much confirms my instinct that an solid oak door is best for theaters , and a pine door -lrb- like you get at home depot -rrb- is least effective .
