framing false wall & firestopping .
i have a wall in my basement in which i have plumbing -lrb- water & sewer pipes -rrb- than run about 8 '' off of the concrete wall .
i want to frame a wall in front of these , which will make the wall approx .
12 '' offset forward of the basement concrete wall .
my question is how do i create firestopping -lrb- 10 ' ceilings -rrb- in that false wall , when it is 12 '' offset ?
how do i do this ?
any ideas out there ?
