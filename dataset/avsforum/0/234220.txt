the official `` g-max '' theater construction thread !
w/pics .
ok , so there might not be anything `` max '' about it , but that 's the name we came up with for our new dedicated ht in the basement .
we have been planning on finishing our theater for a while now ... last year , 5 weeks before christmas we embarked on finishing a guest `` suite '' in a mad rush to have it ready one week before christmas for my parents to stay in .
worked our butts off and actually got it done .
so , one of the walls for the room was also one of the walls that would eventually be our theater .
fast forward to this last october ... i got laid off -lrb- bummer -rrb- .
have been searching for a job and not finding much out there .
so after thanksgiving i decided to start the ht project to keep my mind off of my new employment status .
now to the good stuff the room is fairly small compared to most around here .
it is 10.5 ' wide and 20 ' long .
there are no windows whatsoever in the space we created for the theater , but there is also no back wall to enclose the space .
here are some pictures .
-lrb- i hope -rrb- walls are up and i am starting to build soffets .
some fun pipes to build around ... one side of the soffets done .
most of the soffets done at this point .
insulation added .
here you can see some of the wiring that i did -lrb- no conduit ... d'oh -rrb- .
just about ready for drywall .
got the drywall hung yesterday !
12/26 ready for taping !
we were hoping to host a new years eve party and to use the theater , but we will probably fall just short of that happening .
oh well .
do n't want to rush it ... more pics to come once i get some texture on .
