so what 's up with the mitsubishi hc5500 ? .
i have done a search here and there is very little being said about this pj .
i have read some very good reviews about the hc5500 .
i was just wondering why it does n't seem very popular here especially a 1080p unit that is going for around $ 1,400 after rebate .
