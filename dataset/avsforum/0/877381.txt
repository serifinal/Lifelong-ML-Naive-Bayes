hdmi and component xbox 360 at same time ? .
so , i 've tried this and it did n't immediately work .
has anyone here figured out a way to get the 360 to output component and hdmi at the same time ?
i pried the casing off of the the comp cable so that both cables would fit at the same time .
i get optical audio out of the component dongle and `` hdmi - > dvi '' video out of the hdmi port .
i set both output with either cable to 1280x720 thinking that might make a difference .
no dice .
so , i 'm thinking this is a fool 's errand and i just need to spend some more cash on an hdmi splitter to get the signal to the downstairs and upstairs tv 's .
i was just looking for a `` free '' solution .
