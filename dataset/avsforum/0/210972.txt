what is your reference cd or sacd ?? .
hello all .
as i grow older i 'm getting more into 2 channel stereo than i used to be .
i 'm now on the hunt to find out the best quality cd 's or sacd 's to `` show off '' the best my system can do .
i 'm really into acoustic and/or classical as well as classic rock .
so , what i 'm asking is , what cd do you put in when you want to showcase the best your system can sound or wow one of your neighbors ?
