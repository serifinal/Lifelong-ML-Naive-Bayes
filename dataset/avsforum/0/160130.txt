.
i bought 2 x tc2000 15 '' drivers and one tc3000 12 '' driver .
i?ve been playing with my tc3000 -lrb- which i am thinking of selling now to fund the box build -rrb- and finally got around to doing a box build for the two 15 's i have sitting here .
i figure i give myself an excuse to buy some new tools but went out shopping and thought i ask before i pull the trigger on a nailer .
my original approach was going to use dados or biscuit joints , but others have said glue and nails should be all you need .
i really just want to start with one nail gun for now but didn?t know what size to get .
i assume most builds here are typically using 3/4 '' mdf ... 18 gauge , 16 gauge , or 15 gauge size ?
brad nailer or finishing nails ... which one and why ?
what length nail , straight or angled nailer .
can someone shine some light on this ?
