i have checked and it will as long as it is set to `` direct '' .
additional memory : uses usb flash memory , however the width of the flash memory may restrict it 's use .
so far most `` micro '' versions work .
memory like `` sandisk '' is too big to fit into indention .
source direct option : no known issues : there have been no major issues reported although a few have reported a `` yellow push '' .
in those cases most have simply returned the player and exchanged for a new one and have had no further problems .
