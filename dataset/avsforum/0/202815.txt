samsung a650/a750 gaming mode .
what settings do you use to get the best picture and least lag on your 360 , ps3 and i guess wii -lrb- i have one but i do n't want anyone breaking my lcd screen so i keep it on the crt -rrb- hdmi ?
vga ?
component ?
i hear vga gets rid of all lag and thus your free to change your picture setting and you are n't forced with game mode ... does vga work on all 3 systems ... and if so what settings do you use to optimize your gaming experience
