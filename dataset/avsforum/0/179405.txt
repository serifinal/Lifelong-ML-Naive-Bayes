fusion 5 vs. fusion 7 vs. new lg chip ? .
hello all : while i know the new lg chip found in the dtt900 is far superior to the fusion5 's lg chip , i do n't know where the samsung chip now used by the fusion7 stacks up .
has anyone done any performance comparisons to tell ?
also , does anyone know if there are any usb tuners that contain the new lg chip ?
thanks .
