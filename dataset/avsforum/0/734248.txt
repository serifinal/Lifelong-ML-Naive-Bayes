looking to build my first surround sound .
the speakers i am considering atm are polk : l&r front - tsi300 sub - psw110 center - cs10 -lrb- not getting immediately -rrb- this is what i am starting out with and later on i will get the rears and center .
also , i am trying tpo stay at about $ 500 for the fronts , sub , and receiver .
soo , i am trying to stay at about $ 200 for my receiver .
so , if you guys can help me out by finding a receiver that retails for about $ 300 - $ 450 that would be very helpful .
however , if it is onkyo , then it has be about $ 200 .
so to sum it up , if it is : denon , sony , pioneer -lrb- or something else bb carries -rrb- - $ 400-450 anything else - ~ $ 200
