this event will include only the very latest flagship products from the major ce manufacturers .
we 'll have product management , engineers and product specialists as well as some very special guests attending and presenting at the event .

we 're clearing out all current models so our showroom will only display the next generation from the ce industry .

seating is limited to 21 per avs presentation event .
good food , drinks and the very best a/v available .

- robert -- admin note -- notice to all this is in no way an avs forum event .
avs forum did not give the permission to use our name or site for promotion of a retail store event .
avs forum does not get involved in `` shootouts '' or the like based on how the outcomes are viewed .
as you can already see in this thread , the speculation of the outcome had started long ago .
it is plain to see the issue such events can make for and why avs forum can not be part of it .
avs forum as a company remains neutral on such topics .
value electronics runs ad on this site for marketing and is not connected to avs forum in any other way .
