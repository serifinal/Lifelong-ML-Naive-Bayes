samsung ln37a550 vs. panasonic th-42pz80u .
hey everyone , i recently bought the samsung ln37a550 lcd tv but am wondering should i have gone with the panasonic plasma th-42pz80u .
i work for a major retailer selling home theater equip .
and i thought i preferred lcd however most of my co-workers like the plasma more and it has me second guessing my purchase .
what you need to know : - i have the worst cable/sat provider ever .
it 's ntc who provides to college living communities -lrb- i do not have the option to switch -rrb- - a majority of what i watch is house , the office , nfl , and other prime time shows .
- i also play video games , i have an xbox 360 and wii in which i play rock band and gears of war the most .
- i do n't watch dvd 's too frequently however i use my xbox 360 as of now but plan on getting a blu-ray player around christmas i do n't feel the sd or hd signal is up to par but i have no way of determining it is the tv or the signal coming from my provider .
your help/opinions would be much appreciated !
