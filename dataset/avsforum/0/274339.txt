samsung ln52a650 - calibration ... please ! .
the calibration thread for this tv is ridiculously cluttered and seems to be a battle of opinions rather than actual calibration settings .
can someone please direct me to the most popular calibration settings for this tv ?
it 's such a popular tv someone out there has to have had it calibrated professionally and posted their settings ?
anyone have a quick link so i do n't have to read through mountains of confusing posts ?
thanks .
