dumb question about inwalls and soundproofing .
another question for the experts ... i am building a small theater with james inwalls .
the install guide show the speakers being screwed to the studs .
i am going to use floated quietrock on the walls , will screwing speakers into studs greatly lower the soundproofed result ?
is there away to deal with this ?
any suggestion as to which sounds better , mounting to studs or only mounting to the drywall .
thanks , ian
