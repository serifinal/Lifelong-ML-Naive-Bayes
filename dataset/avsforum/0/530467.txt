need advice on speaker purchase . .
i have a 60 watt per channel tube amp , jolida .
i currently own a pair of psb stratus golds that are 4ohm speakers .
the sensitivity is 88db and the power handling is 250 watts rms with peak power @ 550 watts .
the tube amp is just not powerful enough to drive these speakers .
im thinking bookshelf speakers with high sensitivity .
can anyone here help me with purchasing speakers in the $ 600 - $ 1000 range that would be a good match with the jolida amp ?
thanks !
