terminator 2 : judgment day -lrb- uk release -rrb- .
i just received this and `` the fog '' and noticed the running times were shorter than they should be .
there are no reported sync or film speed issues on either of these , are there ?
just wanted to be sure before i opened them .
i also searched the forums and could n't find any mention of them , either .
thanks in advance .
