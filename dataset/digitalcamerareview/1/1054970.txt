just bought a 30d .
hello all !
i 'm chattphotos or silent shadows in the studio .
i shoot pentax k-7 , but we live in a canon/nikon world .
so i got bold and bought a canon 30d from a friend that upgraded to the 50d mk2 .
i shoot alot of nature , people , pets , and night photography .
in your opinion/experience with canon , is this a good buy ?
if it is a good buy , what lenses would you recommend for it ?
