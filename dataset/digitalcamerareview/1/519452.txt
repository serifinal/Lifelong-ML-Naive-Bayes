can anyone explain sd `` families '' to me ? .
hi all , my first post here is a question .
so back in 2006 i bought a canon sd700is and it has been the cornerstone of dependability , quality , and shooting speed , so much so that i have not needed to upgrade in all these years .
in 2008 my dad wanted to dive into digital cameras and i told him to just get one of the sd powershots and he would be ok .
well he ended up getting a canon sd1100is and its performance has been dismal .
the main negative is that it has a very slow shooting speed .
i looked it up and it turns out that it is a few seconds slower than the 700 .
canon sd700is digital elph review canon sd1100 is digital elph review : 9 .
performance : digital photography review 1.8 sec -lrb- w/700 -rrb- vs 3.2 sec -lrb- w/1100 -rrb- with the flash on .
the second issue is that the image quality is highly lacking .
in some pics , there will be a purple outline surrounding a person 's head .
it only happens sometimes and in lower-light conditions .
so fast forward to today .
my dad only takes pics of his grandchildren and i can attest to the fact that kids are very fast and move quickly .
it is important that pictures can be taken at the speed of my 700 or better .
so as a christmas gift , which sd should i go for ?
i looked on wiki and saw that there seemed to be different naming conventions that might designate a different class/family of sd powershots canon digital ixus - wikipedia , the free encyclopedia so which would be the `` newest '' version of my old school sd700is ?
or an explanation of the different families would be helpful .
currently the sd1400is is on sale for a good price but i have a feeling that it is just an upgraded version of the sd1100is and if so i 'll pass on that .
