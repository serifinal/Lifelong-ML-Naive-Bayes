canon s2 or s3 ?
need some quick feedback .
i read many reviews of two canon models which i 'm considering for purchase , the canon powershot s2 is and the canon powershot s3 is .
this is my second digital camera , my first being a kodak easyshare from about 4 years ago .
we 're going on vacation in 2 weeks and i 'd like to have a new camera to use .
using consumer reports -lrb- july 2007 -rrb- and epinions , i 've looked at numerous cameras , trying to get the best i can , and i 've narrowed it down to these two models .
zoom has been a consistent failing of my trusty old kodak , hence the reason i 'd like a much heftier zoom .
that 's certainly not my only consideration , but it does matter .
the s2 ranked # 1 in cr , the s3 ranked # 8 .
right now , i 'm tending towards the s2 , based on everything i 've read , including the reviews of each .
here 's my question for you : given that the s2 is harder to find but still available , and that the s3 's price has dropped into the high $ 200s , would you choose the s2 over the s3 , or would you take the s3 , given the tiny improvements on it over the s2 -lrb- a bit less noise was one , i believe -rrb- ?
thank you very much !
i appreciate the knowledge that you all share and the depth of your reviews -lrb- a big nod toward howard creech , specifically -rrb- , hence my request to you to help me make the final choice on our new camera .
