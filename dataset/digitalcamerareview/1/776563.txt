a570 upgrade to g series ? .
hi there all , i have a question about something of an odd comparison .
i 've got an a570is which i am very happy with , at the price point the quality of the images is excellent .
i 'm thinking now of upgrading , however , to a g series p&s -lrb- either g7 , g9 , or g10 -rrb- .
i 'm still looking for something that will fit in a pocket and has as good image quality i can get , while of course considering the various pricepoints .
now in looking at images from all of the cameras in the g9 and g10 there are obvious improvements over not just the a570 but also the g7 , possibly due to the larger sensors but i think more likely due to the new processing system , there are really noticeable improvements in both washout situations -lrb- which i 've noticed is a problem in my a570 and have seen is an issue in comparative g7 photos -rrb- as well as in noise handling at high isos -lrb- this one 's really clear in comparative photos , and is important for indoor , flash-free shots which i take a lot of , but i wondering if the noise handling could just as easily be replicated in photoshop with some blurring or unsharp masking -rrb- .
my primary question is , how dramatic are the improvements of the g7 over the a570 ?
i 've found it hard to find comparative photos between the two .
i know the washout and noise are still a problem with the g7 , but how do they compare to the a570 ?
i imagine the wb is the same so washout would n't be helped at all .
when i bought the a570 , the g7 was still at the 500usd pricepoint , where i found its improvements negligible compared to the cost , but at its reduced prices two years later , i wonder what the upgrade from the a570 to g7 is now worth .
thanks in advance for any advise , darunium
