price drop ? .
i wonder when there 'll be a price drop for the sd870is currently , best buy and future shop are still selling it at $ 399.99 cad with an occasional sale at $ 379.99 when is it ever going to drop thru the $ 300 point >_< i was hoping that newer models would be announced ; therefore dropping the price ... but does n't seem like there 're much new p&s models out from canon
