lag time - sd1100 vs. sd1200 .
i am debating between the canon sd1100 or sd1200 .
it will be a gift for my ten year old , but i will use it as my backup camera i want something within $ 200 that has minimal lag time - is there a difference in lag time between these two ?
i 'm wondering if the sd1200 is worth the extra $ 50 . .
thanks .
