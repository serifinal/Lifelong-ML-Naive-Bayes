selling my s5 is and need ideas for a new camera .
after some serious thinking , i have decided to sell my nearly brand new s5 is on ebay .
i like it a lot , but i really want something different , that allows me to control the focusing a little more , because i 'm not good with the manual focus on these cameras !
i got it less than a month ago , and i love the feel of the camera , but i 'm looking for something with a manual focus ring .
do you have any suggestions for a canon digital slr ?
i 'm not really sure what i 'll get , but i 'd love to hear suggestions from you all .
i 'm considering some other brands too , but i do n't know much about what else canon has to offer .
