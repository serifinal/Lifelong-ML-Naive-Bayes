is the canon sd800is durable .
i 'm planning to get the canon sd800is and have a question about how durable digital cameras are .
i plan to use the camera for family photos and vacations , but occasionally will take it with me when i ride my dirt bike .
it will be kept inside a backpack with padding around it .
will the bouncing around that takes place riding an offroad motorcycle cause any problems with a digital camera ?
