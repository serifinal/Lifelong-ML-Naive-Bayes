canon sx10is : flash and geotagging .
hey all - about a year ago , i bought a canon sx10is .
i love shooting , but i 'm not technically competent enough to justify the purchase of a dslr .
this is a great , glorified snapshot camera with a great zoom and , at least for now , is working for me .
except : 1 .
i 'm absolutely kicking myself for not finding out whether the camera had a gps for geotagging .
doing this manually sucks and is hardly accurate unless i 'm pretty familiar with my surroundings .
are there any external options for saving gps data in the photo 's exif data ?
2 .
the built-in flash ... blows .
can anyone recommend a decent after market flash ?
i 'd like one that allows me to adjust the directionality and perhaps even comes with a diffuser .
any thoughts would be much appreciated .
