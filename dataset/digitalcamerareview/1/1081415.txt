help need new camera with fast shutter speed !!! .
hello , im looking for a camera that has fast shutter speed to capture pics of small and quick rugrats !
i take photos at the beach as well as indoors ... i always miss great shots because my camera takes waaaaayy to long to shoot ... .
im looking at canon and my budget is maxed at $ 300.00 ... can anyone suggest a good camera with good battery life ... prefer a rechargable battery too !!
thanks , my sanity appreciates it .
