canon s5 is .
thanks to some very helpful members on the forum http://forum.digitalcamerareview.com...6750#post16750 and reading the reviews about this camera my husband is about 98 % sure this is the camera he wants , however we were wondering about the video setting .
we read that this camera will allow you to zoom while recording , we were able to do this as well with our past kodak cameras however there was always the horrible mechanical noise imprinted in the video .
here 's one example , a video of a trip we took to walnut grove , mn with the annoying sound http://www.dropshots.com/48racefan#d...06-23/15:58:20 is this sound also present on the canon when video is being recorded ?
thanks again for everyones helpful advice .
