yup , it 's the a570 vs a720 question again ! .
ok , basically the difference in features is 8mp vs 7mp , and 6x vs 4x .
i would like to know -lrb- from someone who has had experience with both cameras -rrb- : comparatively , which has 1 - better overall -lrb- indoor/outdoor -rrb- picture quality 2 - better battery performance 3 - faster -lrb- shutter lag/shot to shot/flash recycle -rrb- operation 4 - less red-eye problems thank you !
