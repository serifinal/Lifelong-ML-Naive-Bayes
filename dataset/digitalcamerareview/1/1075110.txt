== > need to replace powershot s3is * fast * - help ! .
i 'm on the road and my powershot s3 is has died .
it was my first digital camera and i have * loved * it .
given the wear and tear it 's received i 'm honestly surprised it 's lasted this long .
anyway , i 'm currently in a rural area with limited web access -lrb- researching is an issue -rrb- .
my girlfriend will be coming to meet me in a week and can bring a new replacement .
if it were possible for her to walk into a store and pickup another s3 is then the problem would be solved , but i 'm willing to guess that it 's been replaced by an `` upgrade '' .
my question is what camera is most like the s3 is that is currently available ?
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated .
thank you in advance for any help !!
