waterproof vs. humidtyproof .
i am camera shopping .
a friend recommended the canon sd1300 .
i read about it on canon 's website .
the operating humidity range of the sd 1300 is 10 - 90 % .
that gave me some concern .
so , i called their tech support and the d10 -lrb- waterproof rated -rrb- was suggested .
it costs more and is bulkier , but can be used underwater up to 33 ft. impressive right ?
although , i do n't do underwater photography , surely it must be suited for all moisture environments above ground .
right ?
-- wrong !
when i read their specs on this model , they limited it also to 10 - 90 % operating humidity .
this is the very same limitation as for the sd1300 .
this prompted me to call tech support to ask if this was a mistake -- perhaps a misprint .
the answer i got was that `` humidity '' refers to above ground use , as opposed to underwater use .
the tech guy did not have me convinced that he really knew what he was talking about in this regard .
so , i redialed and got another .
the second guy seemed more assured with his answer .
but his answer was basically the same as the first .
and when i asked him specifically if the d10 -lrb- which waterproof rated -rrb- was in a foggy environment -lrb- e.g. coast redwoods -rrb- would it provide a higher level of protection than the sd 1300 .
he said , `` no '' .
he said it would be subject to the humidity environmental limitations as the sd 1300 .
apparently , although the d10 is specially protected against water , even water under a certain degree of pressure , it is not from water vapor .
i am surprised by this .
so a question for you outdoor camera buffs : what ?
point and shoot ?
camera is good for both rainy and foggy environments .
thanks
