write speed for a720 is .
last weekend we bought a new canon a720 is digital camera .
now we are looking to buy an additional 2 gb sandisk sd memory card , and are considering either their ultra ii plus -lrb- which includes the usb connector -rrb- or their extreme iii card .
they claim for the former a minimum 9mb/second sequential write speed lets you capture large image files faster and for the latter a minimum 20mb/second sequential read and write .
we expect to be primarily casual users of this camera , and take occasional video clips of a few seconds to perhaps a couple of minutes or so .
given i can buy either of these cards today for the same price -lrb- $ 30 -rrb- at circuit city , which would be a better choice for our usage - the usb interface or the faster write speed ?
i have read through all i can trying to find the camera 's maximum write speed , but do n't find anything specific .
i even called their technical support line and got a very generic answer that suggested the lower speed was adequate .
obviously a faster write speed is always better than a slower one , especially when it comes to recording some video .
but when the card 's capability exceeds that of the camera 's , then there is no value .
any insights ?
thanks in advance for your words of wisdom !
