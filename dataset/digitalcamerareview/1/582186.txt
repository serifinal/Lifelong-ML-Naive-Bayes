canon powershot sd870 is .
hey guys , new to the forums , but a senior member on notebookreviews.com i just have a few questions on this camera , although i did do some research on this camera -lrb- reviews mostly -rrb- and i 'm very likely to purchase this camera .
i 'm not a professional photographer , but i do want something that is solid , excellent quality pictures , small , compact and user-friendly .
so i believe this camera is perfect for all my needs since i will mainly use it to take photos of trips , family and friend events , etc. etc. .
now i did check out the samples of pictures taken with this camera , and it seems like pictures taken in the dark seem to be very grainy ??
i 'm not too sure if its the setting of the camera or it just really sucks at taking photos in the dark ?
my other question is if there will be another updated model gon na be released anytime soon ?
if so , is it worth the wait ?
i do n't need it asap , but if it 's not gon na be updated for a long while , i will take my chances and purchase the 870 is .
and lastly , any suggestions on other cameras/models i should consider ?
thanks
