a720is zoom query .
hi everyone i am trying to decide which of the canon powershot models to buy , either the a710 or a720 .
the only thing i am not sure of is whether it is possible to use the zoom lens feature in movie mode on the a720is , as i know you can on the a710 ?
does anyone know the answer to this query for me ?
thanks to all who respond .
brian
