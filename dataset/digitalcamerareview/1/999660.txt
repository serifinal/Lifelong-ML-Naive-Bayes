panoramic .
i 'm pretty much a point-and-shoot type of person .
but i 'd like to be able to take panoramic photos for an upcoming trip .
i am thinking of getting one of the canon elph models , but i 'm not sure if i need to look for anything in specific regarding panoramic mode .
do i need a camera with a special lens ?
or just a camera with that feature ?
do any of the elphs have this feature ?
my old digital cameras have all been sonys and none of them had this feature , unless it was there and i never stumbled across it .
i heard you can use a feature called `` stitch '' or something to put together several pics , but none of my previous cameras had this , either .
please help !
