canon powershot s95 .
hello - i read somewhere in these posts , that the s90 is almost identical to the new s95 , is that correct ?
i am looking to purchase a s95 , because the ads claim a better picture in low light conditions , and the image stability .
these cameras , from what i have found so far , are about $ 100 apart in price .
the s95 are selling on line around $ 399 , and the s90 's about $ 300 .
so , if they are the same , just a newer addition , i probably should be looking for the s90 , since there seems to be better deals on them , and there are tons of used ones for sale .
what do you think ?
thanks
