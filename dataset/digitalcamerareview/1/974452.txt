canon s5is or something newer ? .
hello , i have a question .
i have a canon s5is that i bought about 2 years or so ago and i love taking pictures with it but never really have learned how to use it .
i know little to nothing about shutter speed , aperatures , depth of field or anything really .
here 's my question .
i want to learn .
mostly by teaching myself through resources on the internet and by just learning hands on .
however am i better off learning on what i have before i shell out money for a more expensive camera ?
i realize my s5is is not a dslr and i really want a dslr but is it enough to learn on for now ?
i have my heart set on a nikon d3000 to start and i know i can get about a quarter to a 3rd of the money for it by selling the s5is on kijij or somewhere but i just do n't know if it is worth it right now or if i should just stick with what i have ?
