s410 replacement .
hi , i have owned a s410 elph for n * years .
i have up to 4g compact flash cards , 3 batteries , and a pouch for it .
i could feel it is getting to its end of life .
-lrb- i hate to replace it because it could still take great pictures , but buttons are not really working !! -rrb-
i do not want to invest any more on the accessories or gadgets , but i think i need a new camera .
do you know which other newer model -lrb- canon preferred -rrb- takes cf card ?
thanks a lot .
