canon 520 and 720 .
i have the canon powershot 520 .
i 'm thinking of upgrading to the powershot 720 .
i like the bigger screen on the back .
would this be a good choice for my ugrade .
this would be my 3rd powershot purchase .
i hand my older camera down to one of my children and then buy the new one for myself .
is there any other model that would be better .
i feel that i 'm used to the features on this and would n't have to learn anything new .
is there anyone out there who has the 720 and can compare it to the 520 for me ?
thanks
