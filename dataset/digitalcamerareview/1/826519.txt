canon 50d .
after reading review after review i went and held the canon 50d with a 28-135mm lens .
i must say i like the feel of it .
very well built i feel .
i think i am going to take the plunge and buy one , i just am not sure what the best len would be for it .
i like to shoot outdoor photography - sporting events - any advice on lenses would be great .
thanks in advance , mike o.
