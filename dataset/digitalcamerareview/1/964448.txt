should i get a 50mm f/1 .4 ? .
hi guys , a few weeks back i posted about possibly replacing my 17-85mm canon lens , but i 've decided to keep it after all .
i 've really been looking closely at the canon 50mm f/1 .4 lens , which seems to have very positive reviews .
anyone have first-hand experiences or comments about this lens ?
it is about $ 399 where i get it here in vancouver , canada !
