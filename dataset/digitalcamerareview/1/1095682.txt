canon australian cameras .
i 'm looking at getting a new camera and came across these two , the canon ixus 860 -lrb- powershot sd870 -rrb- and the ixus 870 -lrb- powershot sd880 -rrb- -lrb- why ca n't they keep the same numbering system ? -rrb- .
when i googled them the following links to the canon australia website came up .
http://www.canon.com.au/products/cam...ixus860is.aspx http://www.canon.com.au/products/cam...ixus870is.aspx the main camera menu on the canon website does n't show these cameras , however , and i ca n't find many places that sell them -lrb- only online stores -rrb- .
are these discontinued models in australia as it appears that they are still being sold overseas .
thanks
