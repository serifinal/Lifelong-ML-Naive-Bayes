going in for a telephoto lens for s5is , help ! .
hi , i have s5is and off late i feel like the zoom isnt sufficient and would like to go in for a telephoto lens ... a couple of posts i read tell me that the canon 's default offerings isnt as impressive as its sony counterpart ... i would like to know which lens to buy ?
any magnification is fine with me -lrb- 1.5 / 1.7 -rrb- its a bit urgent , please put in your views i have read about the reviews on lensmate , but still would like to know from a user , which one i need to pick up ... .
and other accessories that are necessary regards
