who is slow ?
me or the sd890 is .
i bought the sd890 is .
charged the battery overnight .
put it in manual mode on continuous shot -lrb- flash off -rrb- to take pics of the kids outside -- the shutter speed is half as fast as my sd550 , using 400 iso .
i am using my same 4g card i use in my 550 , and since i have a few of these i do not want to buy faster cards ... help , advice , or return it ?!
my reasoning for the 890 - 1 .
it still has a viewfinder 2 .
it has more manual control buttons on the outside -lrb- so i can switch modes w/o going thru a menu -rrb- 3 .
has 5x optical zoom 4 .
wanted another canon =-rrb- p.s. i considered the sd990 is , but price and the fact it claims the same shutter speed kinda decided it for me .
