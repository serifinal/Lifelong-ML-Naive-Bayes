s70 vs s80 .
hello everyone , my name is sean , i am new to this site and new to the art of photography .
my family may be getting a digital camera for the first time for x mass , i know we live in the stone age of slrs .
but i did some research last summer and almost bought a s70 with my graduation money .
but now i 'm back in the market and i have noticed the s80 .
is it overall better than the s70 ?
is raw importaint to me ?
and most importaintly ; do both cameras really have a problem with purple fading on the edges ?
keep in mind i 'm used to disposable cameras , so anything is an improvement .
any personal experience and help is welcomed .
thanks , sean
