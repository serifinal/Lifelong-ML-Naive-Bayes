canon a570 is vs canon sd750 .
okay so i bought the canon canon a570 is three months ago , im all new to camera 's and was thinking i wanted all the manual features , but all i do is auto !
i am looking to get a smaller camera , cause i do n't like lugging this block around in my pocket .
my question : am i going to be missing the image stabilization on my current camera if i go to one without it ?
i got no clue ?
last note . .
any other small camera 's that have long battery life and take good auto shots around $ 200 ?
i also like video mode ... thnx bramp
