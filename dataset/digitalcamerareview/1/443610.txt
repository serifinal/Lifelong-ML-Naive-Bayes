any tips ? .
i was recently looking into the canon s3 is and s2 is powershot cameras .
but i learned they have a camcorder mode that comes with them .
i just got a camcorder for xmas , so i do not need this option with my camera .
i really want something with the same abilities and easy to use feel of the s3 and s2 .
any tips on a camera out there that fits this description of the s3 and s2 without the camcorder option ?
i do not want to pay for something i will not use .
thanks for any advice .
