canon a450 , a540 or a710is .
hi i am tasked with buying a digital camera for a pre-school .
we have a rewards scheme with a local company and can get a camera for free but have to choose between the above three cameras .
we used to have a sony cybershot 4.1 - and found that it was really bad with taking photos of the children inside -lrb- 3/4 of photos come out blurry -rrb- , and sometimes the camera would take so long to take the photo , that the moment you were trying to capture would be lost .
our needs are simple really .
the camera needs to be fairly user friendly , as most people that use it have very limited knowledge of cameras .
size of camera does n't matter .
our photos are of children under 5 playing .
we mainly print 4x6 prints , but have the occasional photo blown up to 8x10 .
the main thing we need the camera to do is take the photo when we need it to -lrb- no lag -rrb- , and for the photo not to be blurry .
our indoor shots are in low light normally .
we do n't care about manual controls or optical zooming etc. . .
we would just like a nice sharp photo .
thanks !
