canon macro lens .
i 'm looking at the canon - 100mm f/2 .8 macro lens from a big box store .
can anyone tell me a little something about this lens please .
i know i want to take close up shots and from my little knowledge about photography i have so far any advice would help .
is it considered a `` true '' macro lens with a focus range of 1 ' - infinity ?
also , what does the term `` infinity '' mean .
i found out it is considered discontinued as well .
so should i pick this one for the price of $ 599 ?
i 'm not ready or advanced enough to purchase the newwer $ 1000 model .
thanks .
