a590 compared to a3300 .
i 've used the powershot a590 is before and i think it 's a pretty good camera .
i 'm interested in the powershot a3300 is and i 'm wondering how they compare to each other ?
i 'm not really talking about specs , because i can read that myself .
what i mean is how they perform , picture quality , ease of use , overall quality , etc. .
just because the specs on one are better than the other , it does n't necessarily mean it 's better camera .
if it matters , i primarily take pictures of my pets , usually while they 're sleeping .
i also take pictures of birds in nearby trees through the windows .
the a590 did a fair job with both , but the optical zoom could have been better for the bird pictures .
i think the higher mp in the a3300 will make a noticeable difference in the cat pictures .
all the cat pictures taken with the a590 could n't quite capture all the detail in the tabby cats .
