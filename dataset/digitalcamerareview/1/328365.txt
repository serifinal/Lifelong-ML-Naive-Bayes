charging sd750 in argentina .
so , i 'm spending two months in argentina this summer and i decided to get the sd750 -lrb- have n't ordered it yet -rrb- .
does anyone know if this product is dual voltage ?
-lrb- i am not even sure how it charges yet though . -rrb-
that is to say ... can it charge safely simply using an argentinean power adapter without it getting zapped , or do i need to buy a converter ?
their voltage is much higher there .
thanks a lot .
