canon ef 28-135mm lens ? .
hi everyone !
after a long hiatus , i 've returned from notebookreview , because of course , my interest in serious photography has returned !
this time , i 've inherited my dad 's canon eos 20d -lrb- he jumped to the 5d mark ii -rrb- , so that helps motivate me from my previous point-and-shoot , the sd800 .
so i 'm still using the 17-85mm lens , and i think its a good idea to replace it .
i 've heard mixed opinions about the ef 28-135mm lens , i wonder if any of you guys can give more insight ?
i 'm mainly using it as a general lens , for everyday-usage .
my dad -lrb- and now i , since i inherited the 20d -rrb- has a long-range lens so i have that otherwise .
i want a better lens for everyday photos , indoor photos , and definitely good image stability .
is the 28-135mm the right lens for this ?
if not , any others under $ 400 you guys could recommend me ?
thanks a ton !
sam
