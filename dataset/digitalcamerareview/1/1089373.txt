re : canon powershot sx130 is review discussion .
i 'm about to buy a new camera and i was thinking about that nice sx130 , it is compact , aa batteries and nice zoom , mean while , i fell in love with the upcoming sx30 .
everything tells me to buy the cheap , small and aa batteries operated cam and not to the buy a more expensive bulky sx30 , but com ` on , 35x zoom ??? that 's amazing .
at some sites , i found sample images of sx130 superior than that of sx30 !!
could this be the case ?
i know sx30 is a pre-release , but anyone compared sx130 with sx20 -lrb- closest relative -rrb- ??
