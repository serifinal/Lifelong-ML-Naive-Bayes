sd700 is - black screen .
hello people , my sd700 is - is giving me some hard time lately .
the screen goes black when i turn it on , menu and all button appear to be there , but its as if the shutter is closed .
sometimes it help when i turn it off and on again .
but lately i have n't been able to take any shots or videos at all ... .
i 'm thinking maybe its some kind of a computer problem , maybe a new firmware or a hard reset will help .
any suggestions ?
any ideas where i can get the firmware ?
i tried canon website but with no luck .
thanks ahead ,
