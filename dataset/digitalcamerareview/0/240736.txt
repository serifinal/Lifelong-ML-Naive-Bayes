my s5is hates cold weather ! .
i love everything about the camera but my husband does n't .
he is a hunter and every time he takes the camera to the woods hunting and the weather is colder than 45 degrees it will not take pictures ... sends up an error message `` change batteries '' .
can someone tell me why this is happening ?
thanks !
it never does this any other time !
needless to say ... he thinks its a dud .
