image badly pixelated on 40 '' tv - help ! .
i have had a canon sx30 for about a year and have been very pleased , images look great on laptop or printed .
i have just invested in a home media server accessed via a sony bdp 480 .
all of the pics i have taken on the canon look terrible , yet all of my previous casio files look great .
i have tried shooting at max size and smooth compression and the problem persists grateful for any ideas - and happy new year al
