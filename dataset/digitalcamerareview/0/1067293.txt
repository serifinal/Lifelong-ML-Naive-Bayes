can image size be reduced in rebel xti ? .
i got a canon rebel xti for my birthday and admittedly do n't know much about it .
i keep jamming up my photo program when i try to download pictures from the camera .
the pictures are very large when downloaded .
is there a setting on the camera to reduce the size of the photos ?
thanks so much !
