view finder blurry .
i have a canon sx 10 .
i was having someone shoot a picture for me , they said the view finder was blurry or out of focus .
i thought it was just me , as i wear reading glasses , but sometimes not when i 'm shooting pictures .
i went through the settings , and could n't find anything about the view finder .
i reset the camera to the default settings , but it seems the view finder is still out of focus .
pictures come out fine and the lcd monitor is crisp and clear .
any suggestions , or has anyone had this issue ?
