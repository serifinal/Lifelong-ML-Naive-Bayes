newbie needs help .
i just bought the rebel t3 bundle with 18x55 and 75x300 lenses .
is there a power zoom on this camera ?
i can zoom manually and take a picture but when i try to use the zoom buttons it takes the picture from the original view .
i have checked the manual and google and i just ca n't figure it out .
