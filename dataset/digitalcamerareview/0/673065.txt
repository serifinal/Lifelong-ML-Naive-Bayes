issue with deleted content from g11 - help !!!! .
hi i accidentally used the erase feature on my g11 to delete a movie file .
i removed the cf card so as to not cause overwrite issues .
i have tried about 8 recovery software programs and though some find a .
mov of the correct size and recover it the file can not be played by any media software .
so does this mean the camera has done something weird when it marks the movie as erased ?
do i need to format the card and then run a recovery ?
i really want this movie clip back but am scared to format the card if there is another option .
any help greatly appreciated cheers
