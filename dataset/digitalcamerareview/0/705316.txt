t2i question - af wo n't engage in movie until pressing shutter .
i just got t2i .
i thought once enabled af in the movie mode , the af function should automatically adjust when object distance changes just like a normal camcorder does .
but it 's not .
af wo n't engage unless you press the shutter button half way .
if you change object and need to refocus , you have to press the shutter button half way again to auto refocus .
i called canon tech support and he said that 's normal .
he said it 's better to adjust focus manually .
how 's your t2i or other canon camera 's af work in movie mode ?
thnak you for your feedback .
