died - xsi just died - help .
my new 450d xsi just died last night .
it is only a few weeks old and i am in the nc mountains on vacation .
the camera was fine but while transfering pictures to my pc , the camera shut off .
i have 4 fully charged bateries and none of them make any difference .
there is no nothing when i turn on the unit .
any ideas for quick help ??
i 'm in the banner elk/asheville nc area right now and have several picture taking days left .
thanks randy
