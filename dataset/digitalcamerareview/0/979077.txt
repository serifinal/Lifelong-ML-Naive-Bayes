icons/text/image blurry in viewfinder canon sx10is .
still getting familiar with my new camera .
been reading the manual and really trying to do it myself but am stumped about this problem .
today the icons , numbers , etc that are usually displayed clearly are blurry as is the image i 'm looking at .
stays that way even when shutter button is depressed .
the af frame image is clear .
have n't made any setting changes -lrb- that i know of -rrb- except today i learned to delete groups of pics by date .
husband says it 's blurry too .
help please !
