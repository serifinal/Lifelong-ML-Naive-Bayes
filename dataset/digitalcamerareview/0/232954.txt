canon powershot s5 is print/share light staying on .
my mom bought a canon powershot s5 is , and shortly after she bought it , the print/share button blue light started staying lit constantly , unless the batteries are taken out .
unfortunately , this tends to drain the batteries a lot faster , obviously .
is there a setting to turn that light off when it 's not plugged into a printer , or does it need to be serviced ?
i 've searched a lot of places online and ca n't find any mention of this problem .
i even tried plugging the camera into her hp photosmart printer and printed a photo , but that did n't fix anything .
any help is appreciated .
thanks
