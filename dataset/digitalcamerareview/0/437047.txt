newbie w/canon sd 850 is and no clue ! .
hello , i bought a used model of this camera .
there was nothing with it .
no battery , no manual , no software , etc. .
i have most of the stuff -lrb- i think -rrb- to get started .
i 'd like to physically talk to somebody that actually owns a sd 850 , on the telephone , and have them walk me through the drill to get started .
i 'm retired , so it does n't make any difference what day , or what time of the day this happens .
at your convenience .
i will call you .
i have unlimited hard line telephone minutes .
if anybody out there is interested , please email me : doug100@comcast.net thank you very much .
