s5 is - underexposure ? .
we 've had the s5 is for over three years now , with no problems .
great camera , even if we primarily use it only as a point-shoot camera .
of late , we have been having problems with the auto shooting mode .
in bright light conditions , when you depress the shutter half way , the picture in the viewfinder turns dark - and the picture is taken without the flash .
comes out really dark - underexposed .
we 've tried resetting the camera menu settings to default - no help there .
any ideas ?
