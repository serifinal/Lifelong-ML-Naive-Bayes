white lines with my a470 captures .
this happened just recently .
my canon a470 woudlnt capture images correctly whether indoors or outdoors .
the lcd is fine it 's just that after taking pictures , white horizontal lines are on the pictures taken .
i reset the settings , reformat my storage device and changed it , and cleaned the lens but still no use .
my cam is just 14 months old .
any idea why it is happening ?
btw , here 's a sample capture .
please notice the white lines .
