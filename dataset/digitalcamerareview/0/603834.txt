canon sd790is - busy sign and `` unidentified image '' .
hi , i recently got a canon sd790is and last night i was using it to take pictures/videos at a show and ... i was recording videos and after i press stop rec ... it shows the busy sign for like 5-7 seconds until i can record another video ... is this normal and i got a 8gb sd card ... and a couple of my last pictures/videos like 10 ?
when i tried to review them on my camera again it said `` unidentified image '' -- why is this ?
is there anyway i can recover it ?
because when i tried to look at it on the computer ... it says i have no picture to review .
thank you so much and sorry if it is a repeat question
