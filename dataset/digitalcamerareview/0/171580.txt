videos stuck on the card - help ! .
not sure if this is the right place to go but ... i shot video with my a560 and although it will play back from the camera as well as from my sd1300 it will not transfer to my computer from either camera .
all of the pictures from that card transferred as well as two of the 5 videos .
any suggestions of why and what to do ?
thanks !
