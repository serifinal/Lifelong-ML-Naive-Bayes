canon eos 5d question - slow to show pics on lcd .
my husband uses a canon eos 5d at his office , as optical equipment .
lately he has had a problem with slow time from when he takes a picture to when he can see it on the lcd .
he uses the camera for eye tests , so he needs a faster time or it slows down the exam .
he only noticed this in the past few weeks , and erased the memory but still the same issue .
any ideas on how to resolve the problem ?
