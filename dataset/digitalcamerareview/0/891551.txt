sd850 - max video length 60 mins ? .
i have a canon sd850 with 8gb sdhc card and am trying to record video for more than 60 minutes .
i currently have my movie mode set at 320x240 @ 15 fps , and the display says i can record 272 min 45 sec .
however when i press record the most i ever get is 60 min .
anybody else notice this problem ?
