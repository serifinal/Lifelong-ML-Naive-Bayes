sd600 flash not working .
any advice guys would be appreciated .
camera is 1.2 years old .
flash error occurs when in flash mode -lrb- lighting bolt flashes -rrb- .
when flash is not used , camera works .
i called canon and the a$ $ said i could trade it in for a refurbished unit for $ 195 .
any ideas on fix or flash replacement ?
