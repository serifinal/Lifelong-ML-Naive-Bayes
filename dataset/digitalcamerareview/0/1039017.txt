grainy viewfinder -lrb- and lcd -rrb- image . .
hello , i recently bought a canon xs20is as an upgrade to an old and inexpensive kodak easyshare camera .
i am still learning my way around it and noticed that both the viewfinder and lcd monitor image is very grainy on the canon .
not out of focus , just grainy .
this was n't the case with the old kodak .
is this normal ?
i adjusted the diopter adjustment dial , but this did n't improve the `` grainyness . ''
any comments would be appreciated , thanks , mark
