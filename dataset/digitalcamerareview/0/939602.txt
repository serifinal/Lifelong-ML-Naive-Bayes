taking care of my canon . .
hello , i just to make sure that i did this correctly for my canon .
when there is a dust or particles on the lens , can i use a compress air can to blast the stuffs away ?
i know that need a screen protector for the screen , i already bought one , it should arrive at tuesday .
when i want to clean the camera phyically -lrb- of course not the lens -rrb- , can i use a damp cloth and then dry cloth ?
thanks .
