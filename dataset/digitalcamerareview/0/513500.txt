getting the most from the canon d50 .
i am learning quickly the only way to really get the most from the new canon 50d , is to read the manual and stop using auto , and start using the manual controls .
learning to set the shutter speed and aperture is very important if one really wish 's to get sharp clear and colorful pictures .
i think the many who have posted negative comments about the quality of pictures taken with this new canon , just have not taken the needed time to read the manual and start using the manual controls this fine camera has .
