new rules for carrying lithium-ion batteries on u.s. flights effective today .
the u.s. department of transportation has instituted new rules for carrying spare rechargeable batteries on an airplane .
starting today , these must go in the traveler 's carry-on baggage , not in their checked baggage.the dot is concerned that batteries will short-circuit and start a fire in the hold of the plane .
a similar fire in the passenger cabin will be noticed earlier and is more easily extinguished.under the new rules , people can bring an unlimited number of spare batteries with up to 8 grams equivalent lithium content in carry-on baggage .
all lithium ion batteries in cell phones and cameras are below this threshold , and nearly all laptop batteries are below it , too .
in addition , travelers can carry two spare batteries with a total equivalent lithium content of up to 25 grams .
this allows people to transport items like extended batteries for laptops and professional a/v equipment.again , these rules apply to carry-on bags .
the new rules forbid putting spare batteries in checked baggage under any circumstances.still , these new regulations apply only to spare batteries .
travelers are allowed to put battery powered electronics in their checked baggage , as long as the battery is installed in the device .
however , the dot recommends that all electronics be transported in carry-on luggage whenever possible.more information is available on safetravel.dot.govvia smartphone thoughts
