need help understanding functions canon powershot sx210 is .
hi , i recently purchased canon powershot sx210 is .
the problem i am facing is understanding all the functions of the camera .
i read the document that came with the camera as well as brochure from the following link code : http://www.canon.co.in/p/en/112-digital-cameras/190-powershot/1424-powershot-sx210-is/ however this is of no help .
