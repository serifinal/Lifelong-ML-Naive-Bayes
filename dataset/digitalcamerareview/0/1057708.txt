canon liion battery storage -lrb- how to find out % charge -rrb- .
hi , just a brief question .
does anyone know if there is a way to find out the % charge left in a canon liion battery -lrb- specifically for the powershot g9 -rrb- ?
i have two batteries and i need to store them for longer periods of time .
the best charge level to store a liion battery is 43 % -lrb- 40-50 % will do -rrb- .
the charge indicator on my g9 is really imprecise -lrb- i just get 3 lines which can be empty or full ... and i do n't even know if the scale is linear , for instance once i go from 2 to 1 line left , the battery does n't last much longer -rrb- .
so it 's really guesswork on when i get to 50 % ... if there is no way to read % , even some suggestions on how to do the guesswork will be appreciated .
-lrb- btw : the manual says discharge fully then store , which is dumb , this regime harms liion batteries -rrb- thanks .
