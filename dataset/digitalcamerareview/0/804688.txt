no user guides .
i just purchased a casio digital camera and was surprised that no user manual is included in the box .
if you want a printed manual , you must send money to casio .
this is an outrage .
the manual which is included in the cd-rom , is of no use to me as i do not yet have a home pc nor a printer .
is casio the only manufacturer eliminating user manuals or are there others too ?
i recently learned that many manufacturers are no longer including rechargeable batteries or their chargers with the cameras to save them money .
this is like airlines which no longer serves food or beverages in flight .
