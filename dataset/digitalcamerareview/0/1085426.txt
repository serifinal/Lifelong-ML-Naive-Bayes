canon sx110 -lrb- help ? -rrb- .
i just purchased the canon sx110 today .
my old camera -lrb- fujifilm ae345 -- yeah that old -rrb- would have a number on the lcd screen that indicated how many photos were left on my card , a feature that imo is quite handy .
i like to know if i 'm going to have room left for whatever i 'm taking shots of .
however , i can not figure out how to do this with the sx110 , or if it 's even possible .
i 've been looking through the manual with no luck .
anyone able to help me out ?
