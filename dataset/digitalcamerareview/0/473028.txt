olympus stylus 750 digital camera first thoughts .
i 'm currently working through a review of the olympus stylus 750 .
this camera was one of four new cameras added to olympus ' weatherproof stylus line back in august -lrb- the others were the 730 , 740 , and 1000 -rrb- .
all of the new stylus ' have their own `` slot '' in the marketplace , but the thing that sets the 750 apart from the rest is that it 's the first stylus to include an optical image stabilization mechanism .
olympus uses a ccd-shifting mechanism to reduce blur when shooting at slower shutter speeds .
-lrb- view large image -rrb- the olympus stylus 750 has a 7.1 megapixel capture resolution , a 5x optical zoom , and a 2.5 inch lcd .
the camera is sealed against weather and dust .
while this model is not `` waterproof '' , it can handle a rain shower .
-lrb- view large image -rrb- since we 'll be publishing a full review soon , i wanted to give my first thoughts about the camera .
the styling and design is pretty much exactly the same as the previously generation of stylus cameras , with a silver , scratch-resistant finish and slim , tapered design .
the stylus cameras are sturdy and well built.i 'm very happy to see some sort of optical image stabilization in the compact olympus cameras .
while the image stabilization system does n't have as many options as other cameras , it still does its job .
for example , you ca n't `` preview '' the image stabilization - the is only activates when you press the shutter button all the way down.having a slightly longer zoom -lrb- 5x optical -rrb- is also a nice feature of this camera .
so far , the battery life seems good and camera performance is average to good.stay tuned for our full review which we 'll have for you soon .
