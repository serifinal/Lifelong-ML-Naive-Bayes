need assistance with sx20 is evf focus rectangle .
my latest point and shoot digicam is a canon powershot sx20 is .
i moved from an sx1 is to an sx10 is to an sx20 is .
i still have an sx3 is which i use for photos for ebay .
i replaced the sx10 is with the sx20 is because of the hd video .
the sx1 is is another story .
i 'm asking for a solution on how to keep one green rectangle in the center of the viewfinder and disabling the others .
i ca n't find instructions on how to do it in the pdf manual version .
i do n't like all of those various green rectangles when i look thru the evf and want to turn them off in favor of a centered green rectangle .
i 'll appreciate someone giving me step by step instructions on how to do it .
