powershot s3is problems .
i 've had a canon powershot s3is for a while now ... .
it 's been a great camera , but i 'm having some problems with it and am just about ready to replace it .
here 's the situation ... .
it seems to drain batteries , or , not turn on at all .
i was using energizer 2500 mah rechargeables which worked fine until recently .
i decided to replace the batteries since they were getting old .
the new ones suffer from basically the same problem - right after a recharge , the camera either does n't turn on , or turns on but if left for a couple of days will not turn back on again .
i 've also tried to charge it with a different charger - no difference .
any ideas would be appreciated !
