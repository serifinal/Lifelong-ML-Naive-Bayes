help with late sport shots .
i figured out i can shoot in the tv setting to stop the action .
but around dusk i had the darnest time , i tried shooting my daughter clolor guard preformance .
if i set it to tv mode and let the camera focus the screen turned black , so i opened the flash , it did help but the shot came out dark , tried different setting , either it blured the shot or was really dark , pretty much tried them all , indoor , night , p , auto , any insite on what setting will work for a early evening action shot .
