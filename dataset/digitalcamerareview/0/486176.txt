lcd display hopelessly black ! .
hello , i have a 5 year old canon powershot s230 digital elph that has been working seamlessly and has never missed a beat .
today i went to use it , and all i get is black .
i have clicked on the ` disp ' button to see if the lcd display was off and it was on .
i can not see anything to take pictures and i can not see anything to review pictures that have been taken .
i have actually taken three pictures that load into my computer , but they are completely black .
i have a fully charged battery , and i have also ` reset ' the camera by holding the menu button .
the camera is not used a lot and has not been subjected to heat or cold or dropped or submersed in water .
i am mystified ?
any help is greatly appreciated ?
