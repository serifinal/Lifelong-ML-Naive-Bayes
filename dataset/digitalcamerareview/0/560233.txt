using macro feature on sx130 .
i just bought a new sx130 and i am having trouble using the macro feature .
on my old canon all i had to do was push the macro symbol on the left side of the function switch and it would turn on .
the instructions for the sx130 are confusing me .
it says to press the left arrow and then up and down at the same time .
all i have succeeded in doing so far is setting up the time delay and frustrating myself .
any suggestions would be appreciated .
