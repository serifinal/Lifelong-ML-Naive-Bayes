my camera jumped into hot curry ! .
it is no joke.i dropped my camera into hot curry ... i am an ardent food blogger and while taking snaps of one of my recipes , my canon powershot g7 fell into the hot curry and ever since is not functioning.it switches on , but no picture comes into focus , -lrb- i can not see anything on the display screen -rrb- the lens comes out but doesnt go back when i try to switch off , nor does the camera switch off unless i remove the battery.every control seems to be a mess , nothing is working ... please help ... if you have any valid advice , i shall be very grateful ...
