canonsd1000-washed out color .
hi , my wife was trying to set macro mode .
she did something that definitely did not do what she wanted .
now the large square view window shows some menu thing continuously .
ca n't get it to go off .
i managed to take a picture and the color is all messed up -lrb- washed out false colors -rrb- .
to make matters worse we ca n't find the manual plus i would n't know where to begin to fix this .
any help would be appreciated greatly .
thanks , rick p
