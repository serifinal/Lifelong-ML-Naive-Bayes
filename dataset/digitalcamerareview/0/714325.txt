fujifilm finepix f50fd first thoughts .
it seemed like the finepix f40fd had hardly hit the street before fujifilm announced the september arrival of the fujifilm finepix f50fd .
the jump to 12mp on the same physical-sized sensor as the f40fd naturally raised the question of what would happen to iso noise as a result .
fujifilm &#8217; s super ccd-equipped cameras enjoy the reputation for providing the best low-light performance in the digital p&s ranks , but could fujifilm pump up the resolution by 4mp and still retain their low-light lead ?
-lrb- view large image -rrb- a quick look at some blue sky shots has me thinking the f50fd appears a little noisier than the f40fd , but still better than the competition by perhaps a stop .
i took these shots at default values after literally getting just enough of a charge on the battery to run the camera , so there &#8217; s a lot of shooting yet to go before the final verdict comes in .
focus acquisition seems fairly quick , and shutter performance looks good in bright light conditions , based on about a dozen shots so far .
-lrb- view medium image -rrb- -lrb- view large image -rrb- -lrb- view medium image -rrb- -lrb- view large image -rrb- the f50fd has some new features such as mechanical stabilization in addition to fujifilm &#8217; s traditional iso increase method , and automatic red eye correction that i first learned to appreciate on a nikon p&s .
we &#8217; ll have a more complete review of the f50fd in a week or so .
