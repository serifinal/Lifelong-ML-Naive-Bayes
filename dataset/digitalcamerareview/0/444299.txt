picture problem with my rebel xsi .
i just got a rebel xsi for christmas .
my first dive into a bigger type camera .
i 'm going from a hp photosmart to this monster .
i 've been reading my manual trying to figure out why i can not take a decent picture on this .
every picture , no matter what setting i use including the auto feature comes out with bad color quality .
i 'm not even sure how to describe it .
reminds me of the the movie `` predator '' when you 'd see through the aliens vision .
infra-red type quality .
colors are all distorted .
i 've cleared all the settings to go back to default and still get these bad pictures .
inside and outside the house , it does n't matter what i take the picture quality is all messed up .
with my hp i click and get perfection in quality each time .
again , please remember i 've only had this camera since christmas and hopefully i 'm just missing a small detail .
i 'm not at all a pro at this , just a newbie .
i do n't even know if the camera it 's self is bad .
thanks for any help .
