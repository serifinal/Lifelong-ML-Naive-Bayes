batteries run out in minutes .
hello all , my canon powershot sx130 is has a really poor battery life , i am using camera rechargeables but it only last for about 30 minutes , 5 when i go into video shooting , i 've tried using long life batteries but the same thing happens , even though all the batteries i used were fully charged and worked perfectly when but into my mouse , is this a problem with my camera , or should i install something on my computer ?
also , the batteries included with the camera are supposed to last 7 hours -lrb- according to the manual -rrb- , but the lasted the same time as my other batteries .
