max usable sdhc for sx20is ? .
hi all , i suppose i summed up my question pretty well in my subject line , but to be a little more verbose here , i just recently bought and used , and consequently fell in love with a new canon sx20is .
wow .
this is certainly the perfect camera for me .
the only reason i did not go with the 30is is because of the proprietary battery pack .
i swear by my sony eneloop batteries .
love them too .
okay , finally to my question : just how big can i go with an sdhc card for this camera ?
my wife and i attend music festivals all around in wyoming here and would sometimes like to record a video of some performers , which often is about an hour + / - 15 minutes roughly .
i see in the manual that canon states `` max clip is approx .
29 minutes and 59 seconds .
recording also stops when file size reaches 4gb . ''
so , if i have a 32gb card in it , will i be able to just begin a new recording time immediately upon the first one ending at 30 minutes ?
in depth math question here : canon 's manual states 2gb = 10 minutes , 33 seconds .
8gb = 42 minutes , 11 seconds .
so what would a 32gb card hold ?
a very sincere thank you in advance to anyone willing to educate me here , even a little , or a lead to an information source elsewhere .
take care , chuck
