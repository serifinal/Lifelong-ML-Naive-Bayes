canon sd1100 is video playback problem .
i 've taken videos but when i play them back on my camera it plays at fast speed .
i had it working properly before and must have resetted it to fast playback .
i 'm new to this digital technology so please explain how i can playback my video so that i can view them at real time speed ?
thanks .
