canon powershot sx130is power/battery issue .
hello to all - newbie -lrb- to the forum -rrb- here .
i 've had this camera for a year , and love it - never any issues , and great pics and video !
on christmas day -lrb- 2 days ago -rrb- , brought it out to take some pics and had the `` change batteries '' notice on the screen .
no big deal as i always have spares around -lrb- using powerex 2700 rechargables -rrb- .
slapped in a new pair , and same message .
i put the batteries on my meter , and 1.4 + volts .
so , i grabbed a new pair of energizers -lrb- store bought -rrb- that had 1.6 volts - same problem .
no matter what i put in , same issue .
anyone had the same problem ?
is this a send to a repair center issue ?
any help is greatly appreciated !
