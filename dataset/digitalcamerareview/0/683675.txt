new canon xsi .
is it broken or am i just confused ? .
i just purchased a canon xsi from costco .
they only had the display camera left and they offered to sell me the whole kit with 2 lenses for $ 800 .
i 've been shopping around for an slr for a while now so im really excited to have finally settled on one .
however , im just a little worried about something .
i 'm not sure if its a defect or if i just really have no clue how this camera is supposed to work .
when i set the camera to av mode and take a picture the mirror of course flips up and the camera takes a picture .
but , the mirror only goes back so i can see through the viewfinder after i press the shutter button a second time .
the picture will come out fine , so its no like the shutter is just staying open ridiculously long .
is it broken or do i perhaps have it configured wrong ?
it 's worrying me just a little .
when i have the camera in full auto mode it seems to work fine .
i 'm really hoping that one of you will be able to help me figure this out .
thank you !
