ixus 950 is - in built red eye correction issue .
hi folks , i 've got the ixus 950 is -lrb- aka sd850 is -rrb- & whenever i use the in built red eye correction function i 'm unable to copy the photos from the camera .
has anyone also encountered this or better yet have a solution for this ?
alternatively , as a work around can anyone suggest some software for reducing/removing red eye from photos ?
ps .
i 'm using a genuine 4gb sandisk sdhc card .
thanks .
