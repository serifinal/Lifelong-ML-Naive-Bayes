890 lcd question .
i have had my camera for 2 days , it was fedexed from beach camera .
when on , there are glowing spots on the lcd that are hazy and purple , about the size of half a pea .
they are just right of center .
when i turn the camera off , the spots glow green for a second before turning totally off .
is it worth packing it back up and returning it ?
the lcd is clean , no fingerprints .
i just do not know if these spots will get worse .
