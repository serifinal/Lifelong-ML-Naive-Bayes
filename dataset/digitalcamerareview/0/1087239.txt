i dropped my g12 please help ! .
i accidentally dropped my g12 on the floor a couple days ago .
the exterior looks fine without any noticeable scratches .
the camera turns on ok and the lens extends properly .
there 's no damage to the lens as far as i can tell .
the lcd is also fine because it displays all the text and i can also look through my old photos .
it also does not display any error messages .
the problem is the screen displays only black instead of whatever i 'm pointing the camera at .
when i press the shutter button it takes the picture of the black screen .
i 'm guessing the damage is inside the camera .
is this something that can be easily fixed or do i have to mail it back to canon ?
any suggestions are welcome .
thanks .
