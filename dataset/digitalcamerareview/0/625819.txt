rebel xti exposure , white balance and framing .
hi , i recently purchased a rebel xti and so far have not been thrilled with the results .
i 've had a couple of issues that i 'm hoping you may be able to help me resolve .
the first is the exposure and color of the pictures .
i 've tried out the different settings on the camera and overall my exposures feel dark to me and the color balance is way too warm .
i 've uploaded some examples here : http://www.flickr.com/photos/warpdesign/ i 've tried changing the iso and used the simple settings and the more advanced manual settings .
i have not played around with the white balance settings yet or tried different metering methods .
the other problem i 've experienced has to do with focal length and cropping , this is my first experience with a digital slr so i do n't know if this is common .
basically the pictures i take are no where near as zoomed in as when i compose them through the lens .
my camera came with a 250mm zoom lens and i wanted to try it out , i zoomed in extremely tight on a subject and basically filled the entire frame but when i looked at the result afterward in the lcd it was not zoomed in as tight .
is this normal ?
