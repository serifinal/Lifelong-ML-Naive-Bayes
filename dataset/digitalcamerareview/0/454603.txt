canon sx30 vs nikon p500 .
hi guys which camera to buy a canon sx30 is or a nikon coolpix p500 ?
either goes for $ 350 !
please be generous in comparison !
for $ 350 i would like my camera to do everything nothing less .
i might be sometimes concerned in baby shooting !
they always unpredictably moving suddenly .
their smily faces could only last a second !
thanks
