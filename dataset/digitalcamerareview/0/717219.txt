a590 short battery life ?? .
recently i have encountered short battery life with my canon a590 powershot .
by short life i mean 20 or less pix with newly charged nimh batteries : duracell 2650 mah & harbor freight 2000 & 2200 mah batt .
actually the hf batt give me a little more pix .
all batt have been charged less than 100 times .
all batt work fine in other applications , but not the a590 .
however if i use energizer ultimate lithium i get a lot more pix .
they do n't drain as the nimh batt seem to do .
i have 2 chargers & have eliminated them as a source of trouble .
any i ideas on what is causing this premature drain ?
thanks ,
