help ! .
i have a canon powershot a480 and i i love it but i am trying to take some still lifes for my business and am having issues with focosing .
namely , the camera decides where it should focus by putting the little green `` box '' around focus spot .
sometimes , there will be just one green box , sometimes there are two green boxes and sometimes there are three or four all stacked together .
then , sometimes i can see a `` pre-green box '' that is actually white and though it appears and disappears -lrb- seeminly -rrb- at random when the camera is moved .
but when its visible , if i catch it at just the right moment -lrb- which is when the white box is around the whole shot -rrb- i can get the picture i want .
i 've looked everywhere for answers and am hoping that someone who actually has this camera can help .
the problem is that -lrb- i photgraph product vignettes -rrb- usually the camera just picks a spot and then the rest of the image is not as clear .
thanks so much for helping !!!!!
