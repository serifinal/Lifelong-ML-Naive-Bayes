black and white with color accents - rebel t1i .
i 've noticed a lot of people now taking black and white photographs where they can focus on a color or two so that the entire image is bw except for those colors .
ive been looking through the manual and playing with the menu but ca n't seem to figure out how to do this .
i like the look of the pictures and want to try a few like that myself .
any help would be appreciated .
i am running a rebel t1i .
also , what 's this type of photography called , if it does have a specific name ?
