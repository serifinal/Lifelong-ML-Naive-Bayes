canon 30d spots on camera ? .
have jsut bought a canon 30d and there is a spot on my camera .
the lenses are clean and even when i switch lenses the exactly same spot apears in the same place .
the mirror is also clean .
at a close focal length this is nearly exactly round and at a different focal lenght it apears as a very dark small blob ?
could this be the sensor ?
any ideas ?
any help ?
thanks
