sd870 action shots .
with my sd870 in auto mode , any time the camera or subject is in motion the results are blurred .
the special scenes modes on the camera do not seem to fit action shots .
my old canon had an action mode on it .
frustrating as i like the camera but need to figure this out , thanks for any help .
