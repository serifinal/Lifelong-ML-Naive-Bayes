sd950 is file size limitation on exporting files ? .
purchased sd950 is ... took it on the trip , no issues .
as a test shot many `` long '' videos -lrb- had 2 x 16gb sticks -rrb- i notice that -lrb- .
avi -rrb- files on memory that are > 500mb are `` unexportable '' .
i do not have a separate card reader to test .
has any one ran into any of these -lrb- the files can be played on the camera , so it 's not an write or even read issue on the camera itself , but an issue of exporting ... thanks in advance .
