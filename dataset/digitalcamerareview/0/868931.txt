rebel 1ti .
a couple of days ago i happily purchased my 3rd canon camera upgrade .
i am pretty sure i will be satisfied with the rebel 1ti and that it will be awhile before another upgrade .
this is my first slr camera which i was totally unfamiliar with - until pouring over the manual - trying to absorb all the information .
i have frustratingly spent hrs attempting to internally register the camera - but with no luck .
it is my understanding that the camera and computer can communicate to allow you to put your name & address into your camera .
in this section also included steps to copy right your photos .
i know it 's impossible for you to know what step i am not doing correctly , but if someone else experienced difficulty and then success , then perhaps you can enlighten me .
also , any helpful tips are greatly appreciated !!
