help !
multiple black spot on canon powershot sd1000 image .
hi my online research tells me that all those black dots on my images are dust on the sensor and it is cheaper to just buy a new one rather than sending it in for cleaning .
i will appreciate any confirmation from experts here .
the attached image is zoomed at 3x .
without zooming i get the spot on the right corner only .
i feel bad as going through my pics i traced it back to a month before the end of the 1yr warranty .
my cc covers the 2yr but canon-canada has to verify this is a job that would have been under warranty .
