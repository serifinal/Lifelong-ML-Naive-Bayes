help with cropping on my camera ?
... sd870 .
i am snowboarding and have my camera with me , my notebook pc , my portable little printer .
i want to crop a photo i just took and print it out .
the hp printer takes my memory card .
i can connect my camera to my pc with the usb cable but ca n't hook up my pc to the printer because i do not have the right cable .
i am trying to figure this out . .
can i somehow crop my photo and leave it on the sd memory card to edit it . .
and then put the memory card into the printer .
or . .
i tried to edit the photo on my pc , copy and paste it back on the memory card . .
but i was n't able to do that .
sorry so confusing !
darn ... if i only had a double sided usb cable this would n't be a problem .
-lrb- and no , the printer will not let me crop , only does red-eye -rrb- courtney
