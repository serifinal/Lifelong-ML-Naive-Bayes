taking good pictures . .
i have an a510 on the way as per the suggestions forum .
any tips for taking good pictures ?
on all my old camera , admittedly ebay cheapies , they were fuzzy and i could never get the flash to work correctly .
either no flash and they were dark or overwhelmed with light .
thanks .
