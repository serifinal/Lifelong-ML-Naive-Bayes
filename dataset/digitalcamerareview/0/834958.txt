the camera will be available in july 2005 .
during daytime , the hypercrystal lcd remains bright and clear , even in direct sunlight , due to an additional layer in the screen that reflects light away from any external light source .
the screen is also viewable at a 160-degree angle .
the bright capture technology allows easier framing of low light scenes since the lcd preview remains bright enough to see the subject .
the bright capture technology also minimizes blur as the increased sensitivity can allow faster shutter speeds .
