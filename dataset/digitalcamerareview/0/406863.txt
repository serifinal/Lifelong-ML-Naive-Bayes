1400 is macro capability ? .
long story short , i 'm trying to get a shot of the product label beneath the battery of my new phone , and i ca n't find any way to get a clear shot of it .
a : is the 1400 is capable of a macro shot like this ?
b : what 's the best method for getting it to come out well ?
i 've had a few digital cameras in the past , but you can consider me a complete newbie for all intents and purposes .
