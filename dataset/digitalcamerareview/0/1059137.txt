canon powershot xsis10 - pics tad blurry - help please .
hi .
recently my pics have been a little blurry and i ca n't seem to fix this problem .
i take mostly bird and animal shots using the auto focus setting .
i work at the zoo and we 've had two giraffe births in the past two weeks !
so , i really want to get some pics but know i should study the manual further but just wanted to throw out a quick `` help please . ''
thanks so much in advance .
beth
