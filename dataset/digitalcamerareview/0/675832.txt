sd500 and taking pictures that are sharp .
i just got a sd500 and bought a 2gb sd card for it , i cant seem to get a good photo indoors .
this is a 7.1 mp camera , and an old 3.2 i used to have that was a moderate off brand took better pictures .
the 3.2 had a good feature where you could turn the flash off but it would compensate with some sort of anti shake deal .
with the sd500 , indoors the pics are sharper with the flash on but the flash washes everything out in the photos so i prefer to have it off and use light from lamps .
i used to have the sd200 but i sold it because i thought it took bad pictures .
ive tried to use the indoor profile , messing with the iso , and adjusting the resolution settings .
anyone have any good tips or know of a website that posts lots of good information for this camera ?
i have a steady hand somewhat , i dont have a tripod but dont think i actually need one , ive tried setting the camera down and taking pictures that way .
as another example , i tested the camera taking pictures of myself for myspace , at a resolution of 1600x1200 with the indoor profile .
they all look sharp in the lcd , but when i transfer them to my pc they are all blurry .
my monitor resolution is 1680x1050 .
if i resize the pictures down to about the size of the lcd then the pictures are once again passably sharp .
maybe im trying to shoot to close -lrb- usually within 2-3 feet -rrb- , but so far my experience with this camera is that its not much better than a web cam indoors .
