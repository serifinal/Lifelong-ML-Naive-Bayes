canon sd800is vs sd550 .
hello all .
i currently have the canon sd800is .
while its a great camera , i 'm still not pleased w / the picture quality , especially coming from the a95 .
i recently purchased the sd550 on ebay for a bargain of $ 160 in mint condition .
besides the image stabilization , is there really a diff in picture quality between the two pocket cams ?
i know the sd550 has a bigger sensor so will that make a noticeable difference ?
thanks !
