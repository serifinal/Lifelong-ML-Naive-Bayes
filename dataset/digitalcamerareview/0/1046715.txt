sd700 for $ 230 .
saw on slickdeals.net and thought i 'd share with the dcr people .
overstock has the sd700 for $ 250 + with a 10 &#37; off clickable automatic coupon , $ 2.95 shipping .
it keeps going in and out of stock so keep checking and you might get lucky to snag one .
final price was $ 229.74 shipped .
pretty darn cheap for one of the -lrb- maybe even best -rrb- compact .
update : no longer available .
was announced to be a price mistake and they cancelled any orders of 2 or more .
as of now , however , they are honoring the $ 230 price for anyone who ordered no more than 1 and are allowing whoever ordered more than 1 to re-order one only .
