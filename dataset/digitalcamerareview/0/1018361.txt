re : canon powershor sx 20 vs sx10 dear sir , i have read carefully the very competent reviews regarding the two cameras .
i have seen that the image quality of the sx10 looks a little better -lrb- less noise -rrb- than the sx20 , and probably due to the fact that in the same sensor canon put more pixeles -lrb- from 10 to 12 mp -rrb- .
i have the following question : if i use the sx20 but with a lower resolution -lrb- for example en `` m1 '' instead that with `` l '' -rrb- , is it correct that the immage quality will increase -lrb- at least reducing the problem of the noise -rrb- so that the immage quality will be at least equal to the sx10 one ?
or this is impossible ?
thanks for your answer .
