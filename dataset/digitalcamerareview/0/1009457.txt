new sd1400is owner .
just bought my third canon powershot , an sd1400is .
my first digital camera was a 500s back in ' 03 , then went to an sd780 , and now my 1400 .
i love the updated features , especially the fact it will go into macro mode automatically if you are too close to an object .
i just got it , and have n't messed around with the manual settings , but i 'm sure i 'll be able to fine tune it and get some better pictures .
anyway , here is a picture of our fire last night .
i typically overload our fireplace ... i 'm a bit of a pyro .
but hey ... it made for a great photo opportunity .
this was one hot fire !
