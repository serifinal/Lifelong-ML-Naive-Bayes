what am i doing wrong ? .
i bought a used canon rebel xt slr that is about 3 or 4 years old that has taken about 5000 pictures by now .
my model looks shorter and wider than in real life .
do i need a different lens -lrb- i currently have a efs 18-55mm -rrb- ?
it also seems to exaggerate this outcome when i turn it sideways .
