shooting indoors .
i have a new powershot a590 .
i have used the cameras indoors at my kids school concerts .
the room tends to be dark except for the stage area .
the photos keep coming out blurry or dark .

i plan on using this at disney in august and i want to figure this out before then .
any suggestions will help .
the owners manual did nothing for help .
