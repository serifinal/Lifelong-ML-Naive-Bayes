poweshot s2 is question .
i recently purchased a canon powershot s2 is .
i wanted to get a great camera that can handle different situations now that my son is a little over a year old and constantly on the go .
my concern is those shots when my boy is on the go .
action shots .
i really want to capture those clearly .
i am having a little trouble understanding the user guide though .
i have found where to adjust the shutter speed to get those qucik shots .
but do i need to adjust the aperture as well ?
and once i adjust the settings for action , should i put the camera dial to auto to take these action shot pictures ?
sorry , i am trying to learn as much as i can about this awesome camera and i need a little hlep with action shots .
thanks for any input
