canon sd1100 flash question .
hi everyone .
i just bought a powershot sd1100 and i was wondering if there was any way to turn off the orange light that shines on the subject of your picture when you lock the photo and press the shutter .
i turned off the flash , and it still went off , so i went to settings and turned off the red-eye correction and the red-eye lamp , thinking that was the prob ... no luck .
i 'm pawing through the user manual , but i feel as though i might as well be reading the one in spanish .
it would n't be an issue , but the feline subjects i 'm taking pictures of do n't seem to take too kindly to an orange light in their faces ... any help is appreciated .
thanks !
