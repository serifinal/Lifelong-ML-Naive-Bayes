do i have a defective sd870 is ? .
a few days ago i bought the sd870 is and i think that i might have to exchange it due to it being defective .
my sd870 is might have a defective imaging processor chip .
when i take pictures with it the most of the image is sharp , but the lower corners are very soft .
