best setting for group photo .
hi all - very first post here - hopefully will start using this to get questions answered after i fail to figure them out myself .
i have a rebel xsi camera which i love - simple question is - what is the best setting to take a group picture with ?
if i use the full auto mode someone in the group always ends up blurry .
i took a group photo of a bunch of kids in line - the ones in the center were focused but the kids towards the outer edges became blurred .
even with groups that are close together it seems it focuses mostly on the inner people .
any simple suggestions ?
i 've tried the scenic setting too but this is not much better .
i 'm learning , i 'm learning !!
thank you !
