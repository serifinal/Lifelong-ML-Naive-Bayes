canon s5is - sound recording .
hey everyone !
i 've been having some fun with my camera , and have been taking some sound recordings .
my question is , does anyone know how to get the sound recordings off the camera ?
i 've checked my manuel , but have n't seen anywhere that it tells you .
thanks !
