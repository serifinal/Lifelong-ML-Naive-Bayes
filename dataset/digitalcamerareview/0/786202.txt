my sd will not format correctly in my s5 .
new guy here .
hoping for some help .
received a new s5 is for christmas .
bought a 2gb pny sd card .
did the slow format thing with the card in the camera .
it took only about 1 second to complete .
the card works find in the camera , but , the card can not be read with a card reader .
the card also worked fine in my friends palm pilot and could be read on his computer 's card reader , which contains `` palm '' software .
not sure what 's going on here .
the small sd card , supplied with the camera , reads find .
i think my new 2gb card is not being formatted correctly by my camera .
does that make sense ?
any other ideas ?
thanks , aceofharps
