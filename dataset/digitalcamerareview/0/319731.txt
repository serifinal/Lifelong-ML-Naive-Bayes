feast your eyes on an upgraded g series digital camera ! .
first , let me say i own or have owned a g10 , g11 , and g12 .
i am not really sure why anyone expect the g12 to be a major upgrade to the g11 .
the title of this review is the first line of canon 's marketing material on the canon usa website ... so this is what i personally expected , and canon delivered , as far as i am concerned .
i am not a professional , so my observations are from the viewpoint of an average guy with a serious camera addiction .
i took photos side by side using my g10 , g11 , and g12 and i have to be honest , i could not tell much difference -lrb- expert sites has exactly the same opinion like infosync and digital trends : , though a slight nod would go to the newest camera .
they are all great , however , and suit an average user like me perfectly .
my tests were not scientific and not comprehensive - i have to work for a living after all .
i am very pleased with the image quality , but is it a major upgrade from previous g series cameras , i do not think so .
if i were forced to choose one , i would probably go for the g12 because the photos look slightly nicer to me , and the camera is easier to work with but only if i am forced to choose !
