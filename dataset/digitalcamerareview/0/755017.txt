re : please recommend camera for great tattoo photos/close-ups .
i have a canon digital rebel xti , i know there is a newer model out .
do n't buy the kit lenses , if you get this camera .
instead , check a macro lens or my favourite low light lens , 50mm f/1 .8 , in canada , it 's about $ 130 , in the us it 's around $ 100 .
no flash needed , if you have more money , get a 50mm f/1 .4 .
