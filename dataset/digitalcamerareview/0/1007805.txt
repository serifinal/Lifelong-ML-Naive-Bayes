powershot d10-not worth it .
i partly disagree with the review offered here .
it is a good overall camera.however it leaks .
and most importantly the warranty excludes leaks .
i bought a powershot d10 11months ago .
i 've kept it in impecable conditions .
after every swim , i 've always cleaned it as per instructions .
last week , while swimming , water leaked in through the av outlet .
i was shocked as a $ 300 camera should last longer than 11months .
i sent it to the manufacturer and i 've been told the warranty does not include water leak !!!
and had to pay $ 200 to have it fixed .
how can an underwater camera not have a leak warranty ?
specially when there are tons of reviews stating leaks occur in the first year of the camera .
as a canon lover , my first camera was a canon a1 , i 'm deeply dissapointed .
anyone thinking of purchasing a d10 , think about it !!!
