new canon s5 is .
hello all , i just dumped my a630 in favor of the s5 .
overall i find it to be a super camera .
fast operation , is , great rotating screen , aa batteries , 12x zoom , relatively fast lens , many many manual controls , decent size for it 's class , movie mode w / stereo recording , zooming , and ability to take pictures , hotshoe should i need one .
picture quality is quite good , but unless i 'm imagining , it is slightly less than the a630 .
however , i 'm going to wait before i issue a ruling , as i have n't taken enough pics yet .
i 'll post more when i have some more thoughts !
