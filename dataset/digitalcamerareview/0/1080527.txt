canon g12 compatible external flashes ? .
good morning all , i 've just bought a canon g12 , vivitar df-483-can flash , and vivitar cord viv-fc-can .
everything is brand new .
with the flash directly in the hotshoe it seems to work fine -lrb- though about 2/3 stop overexposed for my taste -rrb- with the extension cord the in-camera flash is disabled but the flash does not fire -lrb- in any mode -rrb- , or show indication of control of the flash or match zoom setting .
nothing .
i have checked with a multimeter that there are no shorts in the cable .
the four small contacts show continuity and the larger contact at the top shows an open circuit .
from what i can decipher from various searches , the large contact is unused .
i bought this flash to have a master w/less control unit without the size and weight of the canon speedlite 580ex ii flash .
i was about to spring for the original cable oe-c3 , but with the vivitar cord in hand and looking at the magnified oe-c3 image on the canon website they are the same unit .
-lrb- all markings , line-up and construction of flex-guard -rrb- .
has anyone here had success with an off-market e-ttl flash cable with the g12 ?
i live in the caribbean and the cost of these items start at 50 % more than the us .
i thought i was making agood choice by going with vivitar .
the nissin and sigma flashes have too many reports of failure for my comfort .
the g12 seems to have small but significant changes to firmware that hinders full compatibility with flashes that work on the g11 .
if you could confirm an off brand e-ttl cable that is compatible it would be greatly appreciated .
thanks tony
