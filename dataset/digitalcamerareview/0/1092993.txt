is my camera ruined ? .
hello , i do n't know where to ask , hope anyone can answer here .
i did what 's written in the camera manual in safety precautions .
i pointed my camera directly at the bright light source , i do n't know what is ccd but it 's probably damaged cause now in low light -lrb- normal electric light indoors -rrb- conditions pics without flash and videos quality is like this : is it permanent damage or what can be done in such case ?
camera is canon tx1 .
i 'd appreciate any advice
