after 10 years , my fujitsu pds5001 is now dying ... .
so my question is : what do i replace it with ?
i loved my plasma like a family member and the set has seen the majority of use via sky , xbox/360 , psx , and cube/wii .
in the last 2 weeks , the blacks and greys started failing to illuminate in wide bands , however , for me 10 years for that set is a good return regardless of the prices of 50 '' plasmas in 2001/2 .
as a long time lurker on these forums , i am aware of lcd/led and i have checked a few other plasma threads which seem to point former fuji owners to a sammy xc7000 , however , i am open to suggestions .
while i would prefer something lighter than my set 's 45kg and what i believe to be hungry power usage , i would assume tech advancements in the last 10 years has improved those 2 attributes for plasmas .
thanks for your time !
