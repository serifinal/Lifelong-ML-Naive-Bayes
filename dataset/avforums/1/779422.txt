42gt30 or 42vt30 .
guys , in been a while , time for an upgrade !!!
tried a sony 40hx803 and returned it due to clouding and backlight issues , then samsung with other issues i don &#8217; t have time to scribe .
given up on lcd - so many clouding/backlight issues from all makes -lrb- yes i 'm aware and it &#8217; s a lottery some good some awful ; panel lottery -rrb- , the sony9x3 series seemed to solve bl/clouding problems but # 1800 for 40 '' no way !
-lrb- but sony 9x series the best lcd by far -rrb- i 've been looking at the panasonic 42 '' g30 series and i 'm very impressed , to my eyes it beats even the sony 9x3 series at a lower price .
we visited quite a few shops yesterday including john lewis -lrb- who don &#8217; t sell the 42vt30 , and seem very obtuse on price matching these days -rrb- , but one thing in common all shops recommending the 42vt30 over the 42gt30 -lrb- for example panasonic local shop and s&v -rrb- - the 50hz bug can be eliminated on the vt series and the blacks are deeper -lrb- demo tracking a golf ball in the air , they showed how the vt30 can fix this issues -rrb- the wife is sold on the panasonic plasma for 3d , i &#8217; m happy on 2d .
i 'm sure this has been covered but please bear with me , is the vt30 really worth the extra at 42 '' size , price wise its # 200 extra -lrb- panasonic shop was very aggressive on pricing for the vt30 and until the end of july offering a 6 year warranty -rrb- ; purely on picture quality ?
viewing : - liverpool football games -lrb- wife -rrb- - golf & sailing -lrb- me -rrb- - blueray -lrb- both of us -rrb- , we have a denon 3800bd so very high end .
- tv -lrb- mostly hd on v + box -rrb- - sd soaps -lrb- wife ! -rrb-
- sky sports on virgin v + hd box -lrb- kids -rrb- cheers mr monk
