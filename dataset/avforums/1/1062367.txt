if not a panasonic what should i look at !!! . .
hi have a 5 year old panasonic plasma and have had my heart set on getting a vt30 50 inch but now after reading all the negative posts i am not so sure so my question is what other tv 's should i be looking at or should i take the plunge and hope for the best and get a vt30 as i ca n't believe they are all faulty .
