seating distance . .
can some one just finally tell me what size to get . .
:'-lrb- lol .
i am on the verge of buying a tv -lrb- gt30 -rrb- yet i 'm worried i 'm going to buy the wrong size .
i will be sitting approx between 6 feet and 7 and a half foot away -lrb- 90 '' -rrb- i was first going to buy a 42inch , until i heard that a 46 inch would be better for the distance i was going to be viewing the tv from .
then the tv shop salesman told me that 50inch would be better . .
i then read on a website that sitting less than 9 feet with a 46inch will make the images look pixleated .
i went onto yahoo answers -lrb- did n't want to keep bothering you with my questions :p -rrb- and every one on there said 42 inch would be more than fine and 46 would be pushing it . .
i 've now found a calculator site screen size vs. seating dist .
- flatpanelshd that i would be better off with a 50inch ... i 'm getting really sick and tired of reading so many different conflicting documents/reviews/posts can anyone please just tell me if i 'll be okay viewing a 46inch tv at around 6-8 feet away ?
i do n't care if i do n't get 100 % benefit but 90 % would be fine .
will i be able to tell the diff between 720p and 1080p ?
will i get the benefit of a bluray etc ?
i hardly watch tv -lrb- unless the world cup is on . . -rrb-
but i do watch allot of sd dvd -lrb- upscaled with ps3 -rrb- and bluray .
i have been to a shop where you could test out diff viewing distance .
however they had a huge window in front of the tv so looking at the detail was impossible .
would i be better off with a 42,46 or 50inch tv ?
the 50 inch is way out of my price range tbh -lrb- i 'm going for the gt30 -rrb- and the 46 is out of my price range but manageable .
