panasonic st30 or gt30 .
evening everyone .
i 'm on a mission to find myself a 3d tv .
i 've heard great things about the st and gt 30 models .
now , on amazon the st30 is # 650 and the gt30 is # 850 .
what 's the difference between the two models and is the gt30 worth # 200 more ?
ps my primary use for the tv will be gaming and watching blu-rays , both in 2d and 3d .
pss could anyone post some pics if you own one of the tvs please ?
thanks in advance
