panasonic tx-p50u30b or samsung ps51d550 .
hi ca n't decide between the above tv 's , i have n't actually seen them in any store to compare yet .
i 'm not really bothered about 3d on the samsung but both tv 's have the other features i 'm looking for .
having read about the 50hz panasonic problem i unsure weather to consider it .
any input greatly appreciated .
cheers paul
