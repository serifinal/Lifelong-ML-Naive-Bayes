lg 50pz570t ... ??? .
i 'm looking into getting a new tv for the bedroom , and really am liking the sound of plasma at the minute as the price and what you get for it compared to led seem excellent in my opinion !
this will be my first plasma and i am worried about ir a little but hopefully i will be worrying for nothing ?
does anyone have anything to say about this tv ?
it seems top value for money and even includes a free pair of 3d glasses !
but i cant find reviews anywhere or even anything on forums about the set ?
how are the black levels ?
does anyone own this tv ?
would you recommend it ?
alternatives with good black levels ?
is plasma a good idea ?
thank you in advance !!!!
