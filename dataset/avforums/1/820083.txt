ps51d6900 and poor scaling -lrb- compared to d8000 -rrb- .
good morning !
on hdtvtest the d6900 does n't get any compliments , when it comes to scaling of standard definition .
especially compared to the d8000 ... is it really that bad ?
or was it a software/firmware problem and is already solved ?
is anybody in the position , to compare the scaling of the d6900 with the d8000 -lrb- or d7000 -rrb- ?
thx for ur help !
i would like to buy the d6900 , but most of my contend is still standard definition and the tv should be able to handle it !
