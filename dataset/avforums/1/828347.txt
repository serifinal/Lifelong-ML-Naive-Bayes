best ~ 55 '' led tv on picture quality alone ? .
budget - # 1800 -lrb- though if theres no actual difference in the picture quality/screen between a tv costing 1100 and a tv costing 1800 , and the difference is just due to features i dont need , i 'll obviously go for the cheaper option ! -rrb-
after the best 50-55 '' tv , on picture quality alone : - purely for movies - dont care about ` smart tv ' and all the other pointless stuff -lrb- usb slots , wifi etc. . .
etc. . .
dont need any of it -rrb- - all i care about is the picture quality - not considering plasma due to the burn-in/image retention issues , especially as most films i watch are 2.35:1 -lrb- unless the latest ones dont suffer from this problem anymore ? -rrb-
- not fussed about 3d - dont care about audio or design - think i 've put the emphasis clearly on picture quality alone !
- must be led - full array backlit with local dimming -lrb- makes the search very hard ... -rrb- any recommendations ?
because of my insistence on full array backlit - im hoping to stumble across 2010 range tv 's that are going cheap .
i 'd rather have a 2010 full array than a 2011 edge lit ...
