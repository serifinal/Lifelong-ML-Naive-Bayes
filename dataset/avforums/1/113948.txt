support long colums for pioneer pdp434-hde table top stand .
i have been using this plasma for years now in a second room .
we are now making some changes and it will go yet to another room .
however , there is a space limitation and i want to move the plasma speakers from the sides and attach them at the bottom of the display .
i have the supplied brackets for installing them like this , but i have discarded the longer support colums required for the pdk-ts04 table top stand that will allow for this speaker position .
has anyone who has/had a 434 plasma still have this longer support column and who does not need them ?
if needed i can pay something towards them .
thanks in advance .
