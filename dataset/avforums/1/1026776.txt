first post , quick question on the panasonic st30 , gt30 , vt30 .
i have been looking at buying one of these plasma 's but am uncertain on a couple of things i know the vt30 has the best picture of the 3 , but have seen much less info about the gt30 , is it a better picture than the st30 or are they very similar ?
the other question i have is around blu ray playback i know the vt30 has a 96hz option , for blu ray playback does the gt30 & st30 have this aswell , i know the us versions dont and have only 48 and 60hz , but the euro/uk models sometimes have differant specs to us ones and i cant find any mention of this for the uk spec tellies
