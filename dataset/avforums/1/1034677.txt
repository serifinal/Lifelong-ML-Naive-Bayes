lg 50pv350t owners thread .
thought i 'd start a thread and see if anyone else picked one of these up over the bank holiday weekend , and see what they think .
been looking at buying a 50inch for a while , and finally decided to take the plunge after seeing this in store at currys .
have to say i 'm pretty pleased .
with hd content the picture looks brilliant .
sky channels look good as well .
not done any specific colour tuning yet , sticking with the ` cinema ' picture mode at the moment .
not used the onboard freeview , the aerials in the house are n't very good .
having a few issues playing dvds through my amp to it , the picture blanks out every now and again , but believe that is due to my amps 1.1 hdmi sockets as its fine if the blu-ray is connected direct to the tv .
guess i 'll have to get a new amp as well
