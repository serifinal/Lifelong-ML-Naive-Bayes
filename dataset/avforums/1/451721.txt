help - non techie just bought new tv .
hi , two kids finally wore me down and i relented to getting a replacement for 10 year old crt tv .
based on internet reviews i bought a panasonic 42 '' st30 which should be delivered in a couple of days .
now i need advice as to what cabling i need , kids have wii which has 3 coloured wires , youngest has just got a ps3 .
we 've a sky box which will now probably be replaced with a sky digital .
we 're wifi connected so will probably buy one of those dongle things .
do n't have a blue ray player but ps3 plays blue rays .
so what all cabling do i need to order and what sort of price should i be paying for it , is cabling at # 50 a go worth it .
have to get the cabling in advance of tv .
any help appreciated .
