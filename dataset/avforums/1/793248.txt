panny s30 vs ut30 .
hello guys , so im choosing between the panasonic s30 and the ut30 .
about the s30 there is lot of info and reviews to be found online but almost nothing for the ut30 .
so therefore im asking here .
on the official panasonic site i compared the specs of both sets and the only differences i could find where that ut30 has the 3d and the s30 has the mono filter .
i can get both sets for around the same price maybe 50 euro more for the ut30 .
i would really like to hear from you which one i should choose with arguments
