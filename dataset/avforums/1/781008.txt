lg 50ps3000 headphone issue .
hi all my lg 50ps3000 has no headphone jacks or even analogue audio out , it only has optical out .
i want to connect my xbox 360 slim to it using my old turtle beach headphones but the xbox only has optical out too .
anyone have a solution ?
would a digital audio converter be the answer and if so what would i need ?
or , i 'm open to the idea of buying an av receiver but not sure where to start , the options seem limitless .
thanks in advance
