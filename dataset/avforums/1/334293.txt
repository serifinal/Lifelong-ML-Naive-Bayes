fish bone ito/fbi ? .
i read the thread from the visit at the panasonic hq in japan , where the `` fish bone ito '' , or `` fbi '' , is mentioned .
the powerpoint slide specifically identifies this as a sub-50 '' feature only .
i then searched the forums for fish bone ito , and only found two hits ; the thread from the visit to japan , and another user asking about this , and being referred to the thread from the visit the japan .
where this `` fbi '' tech is n't explained at all as far as i can comprehend .
does anyone have any insight into this feature or tech ?
i 'm currently seriously considering buying myself a christmas present , upgrading my 2008 panasonic plasma to this year 's vt series , and i had my heart set on the 50 '' model , but if this delicious fish has some tender meat i need to try , i 'd like to know if i should go for the 42 '' version instead .
