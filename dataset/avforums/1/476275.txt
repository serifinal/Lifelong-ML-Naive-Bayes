samsung le40b550 or samsungps43d450 ? .
im on the verge of buying my first flat screen tv and have narrowed it down to the the above tv , s , both have good and mixed reviews , im leaning more towards the plasma as mainly i watch movies and do a lot of gaming on xbox but the lcd has full hd and cud possibly do the same but has better asthetics and more inputs , any info would be appreciated thanks .
