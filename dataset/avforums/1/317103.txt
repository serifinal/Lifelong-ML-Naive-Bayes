hd tv for fullhd games ? .
im buying a tv for gaming only .
i found this panasonic tx-p42c3 wich has only 16ms of input lag !
my concern is that xbox360 games are 1080p fullhd and this tv is only 720p hd -lrb- not even `` truehd '' , only 1024 x 768 -rrb- when the tv processes the picture from xbox to screen , does it have to somehow scale the image size so it would increase the input lag , cause thats what i really dont want to happen ?!
i would really appreciate if someone who knows something about this could answer .
