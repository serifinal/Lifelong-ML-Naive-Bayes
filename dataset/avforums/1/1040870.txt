g30 50hz bug - does it make football unwatchable ? .
i want to get the best sub # 1000 tv for watching football .
does the 50hz bug render panasonics unsuitable for this ?
is it still better than any lcd , given plasma 's advantage at motion handling ?
is there a better plasma for watching football ?
thanks !
