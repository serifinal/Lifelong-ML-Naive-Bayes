looking for a hitachi av3000e tuner box for my plasma .
hi guys , this is probably a long shot , but has anyone got a spare tuner/media box for a hitachi 42pd3000 plasma tv ?
it dates back to 2002 so i 'm sure there should be a few knocking around by now .
it is quite urgent , as i sold the tv and it bounced back a month later with the tuner box gone faulty beyond repair as far as i can tell .
so i need to buy another box before having to hand back # 200 to my customer as a refund .
