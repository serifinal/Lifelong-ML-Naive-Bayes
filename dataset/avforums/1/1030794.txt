gt30 v vt30 - differences ? .
as far as my limited tech knowledge allows me to differentiate , are these the only differences : vt30 has - better reflective filter , wifi dongle , 2 pairs of glasses , sd card recording as opposed to hdd rec only on the g30 .
i 'm looking at buying one of these two this weekend .
just tying to figure out where extra # is going on the vt30 & if it 's really worth it .
is there anything i have missed , apart from the designs of course .
thanks .
