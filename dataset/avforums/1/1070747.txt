looking to buy a 50 '' plasma . .
have an old panasonic 42 '' .
we have a 42 '' panasonic pe50 , about 6yrs old , we want to get a 50 '' with hd .
we watch with a v + box , but so far not able to watch any hd as tv is too old .
i am looking at either the panasonic tx-p50c3b which is hd ready or the tx-50u30b which is full hd .
we need to be able to connect the v + bos and our old dvd recorder which is the panasonic dmr-es20 .
we have been very pleased with the tv we have , would just like a bit bigger now .
any suggestions very welcome .
many thanks
