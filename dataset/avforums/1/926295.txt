new plasma care help .
hi guys , 1st post so this is me introducing myself .
i 'm off to seven oaks sound tomorrow to check out this deal panasonic tx-p42gt30b 42 '' 3d plasma tv -lrb- full hd -rrb- -lrb- claim free 5yg / 2 pairs of 3d glasses -rrb- @ # 979.00 i think there 's a real possibility i 'll be bringing her home with me !
so i 'm hoping for some advice on settings from other owners as it 's my first plasma-well first anything for a lot of years .
my panasonic quintrix is just looking old these days .
i 'm a bit wary of doing it any damage .
thank you in advance .
