panasonic st30 vs g30 for gaming ?? .
hi , i am upgrading my tv -lrb- panasonic u30 -rrb- very soon and need to know which of these is better for gaming .
the main reason i am upgrading from my current tv is because of a ridiculous amount of jaggies in video games .
i just need a tv with great pq , little/no jaggies , and also i do n't care about 3d , i 've just read that the st30 has a better filter and better blacks .
i always watch my tv in a cave so there is no light affecting the tv .
thanks alot and please reply as soon as possible as i am looking to buy the tv tonight as i have been reasearching for about a week now and i need to pull the trigger soon !
thanks again
