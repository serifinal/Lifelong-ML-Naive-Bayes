lg 50pz250 or samsung ps51d550 ? .
hi guys , hope someone can help me decide between these 2 sets .
which one is better ?
there are really no reviews og these cheaper sets , i only find reviews of the lg pz950 and the samsung d6900 .
one of the things i will use more is the 2d to 3d conversion .
i 'll use this much more than blu rays , so this is a huge factor for me .
i 've read people saying that the 2d to 3d does a great job and i 've read people saying that it does pratically nothing .
this is weird , no ?
could it be that the 2d to 3d conversion on the samsung plasma is better than the lg one ?
or are both brands suppose to deliver the same quality in their 2d to 3d conversion techniques ?
i want one of these sets because they are way cheaper than the others and i could n't care less for smartv , internet , wireless and all that crap .
i just want a good hd picture and a good 2d to 3d conversion !
thanks .
