model numbers desired for multi system dual voltage televisions .
i am an american living in belgium , moving to munich soon .
i think i 've settled on purchasing a panasonic 42 '' plasma television , something like the panasonic th42px80 -lrb- or pz85 or pz800 -rrb- .
if i 'm to invest `` real '' money in a new hd television i need it to be dual voltage and have the ability to display pictures from both pal and ntsc signal sources .
when i look at the web sites of people who sell multi-system dual voltage equipment in the states -lrb- which will do me no good , because i 'm in europe -rrb- the panasonic model numbers start with pv instead of px -lrb- 720p -rrb- or pz -lrb- 1080p -rrb- .
does anyone have experience with a set with a model number like th42pv80 -lrb- or 85 or 800 -rrb- ?
are they dual voltage and multi-system ?
also , another poster seemed to think the pv sets did not refresh at 100hz -lrb- and , i guess they would also have to have the capability of refreshing at 120 hz also , maybe they do n't and maybe this is why ... -rrb- .
does anyone with a pv set know if their set refreshes at twice their country 's cycles ?
i 'd also be interested in model numbers for sony and pioneer televisions that are both dual voltage and multi-system , but in truth the panny seems to be good and i 'll be glad to find any good set that meets the above criteria .
thanks very much .
