good stand for 60 inch plasma ? .
hello , i 'm about to upgrade from a 42 to 60 inch , and i 'd love some recommendations of a solid stand for a 60 inch .
right now the 42 inch is on one of those glass matrix things from argos , which should be fine as a temp stand for the 60 until i find a better one right ?
obviously it 's not meant for a 60 inch , but it does say it supports upto 75 kilos , and the 60 inch is only around 40 .
wo n't look great but should hold the weight at least .
i 'm open to any material or style , but would probably prefer wood or metal to glass actually , seems safer cheers , rumblesushi .
