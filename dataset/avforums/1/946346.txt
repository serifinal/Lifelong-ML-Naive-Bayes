ps51d6900 vs ps51d8000 .
is there a difinitive answer -lrb- i couldnt find one ! -rrb-
, has the 8000 got better pq than the 6900 ?
i 'm looking to buy in the next week or so .
i havent ruled out a gt30 for some strange reason , i think this is more because i 'm thinking if / when it goes wrong i 'll ask for a 2012 replacement .
any replies will be welcome .
i hate buying tvs .
i bought my last one 7 yrs ago , an lg 37lc2d !!
