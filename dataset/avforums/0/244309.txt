lg 50pk590 problem .
hi all hope someone can help i have an lg 50pk590 that is approx 14 months old .
today whilst watching tv , a 3 '' horizonal black line appeared approx one third of the way down the screen and stretches all the way across .
i switched the power off at the mains and then restarted it .
the black line is till there but also looks to have random single pixels within the black border , that some are the same colour , some change . .
any ideas ?
thank you
