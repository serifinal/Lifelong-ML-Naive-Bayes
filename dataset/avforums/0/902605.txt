pioneer kuro krp500 without mediacenter krp-m01 .
i 've a -lrb- new -rrb- krp500a without mediacenter krp-m01 .
now was i wondering if you could use the displayportconnection of the tv with the atlona converter wich can convert a hdmi signal to a mini displayport signal .
it 's capable at 1080p .
it 's developed for a hdmi signal -lrb- ps3 , bd , dvd -rrb- on a macscreen wich only has a minidisplayport .
has someone experience in this matter ?
i think the technology of the tv is inside the tv and not in de mediacenter -lrb- for example the krp500m and the fact that the ir-eye of the remote controller is located in the tv and not in the mediacenter -rrb- .
