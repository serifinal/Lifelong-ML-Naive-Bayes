panasonic tx-p50s10 - viewing issue ? .
i have noticed a slight issue when viewing my panasonic tx-p50s10 this does n't occur when watching any other television i wear glasses , due to being short sighted the room is darkened the seating position is central in the room , 12 feet from the tv , and level with the screen occasionally i see horizontal bars across the screen usually these are more easily seen where there is dark detail and a light background for example a ship with sky in the background when i turn my head to the wall , not viewing the screen , i continue to see these bars any ideas ?
