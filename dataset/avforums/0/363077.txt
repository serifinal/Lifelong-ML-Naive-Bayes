enable 100hz motion plus in samsung ps50c679 .
hi there , i just bought the plasma tv samsung ps50c679 .
i saw in other samsung models that by activating the 100hz motion plus feature , you got this `` soap opera '' effect .
now i 'd like to get this effect on my tv and i don ´ t know if there is some way to achieve that on the ps50c679 -lrb- eigenschaften von ps50c679 | fernseher -lrb- plasma tv -rrb- von samsung -rrb- i have really tried within the settings , but i didn ´ t get to something similar .
does anybody knows how to do it ?
or even if it is possible ?
thank you very much !!
