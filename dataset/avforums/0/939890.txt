panasonic tx-p42vt30e and sony bdp-s360 : 3d detected ???? .
i have a panasonic tx-p42vt30e and a sony bdp-s360 .
as far as i know , the sony does not handle 3d .
the firmware of the s360 has been updated .
the following happened .
i put the harry potter deathly hallows bluray in the player .
the tv reacted with : `` 3d-signal detected , use the 3d button to switch to 3d '' or something to that effect .
when i select the 3d button on the tv remote , it gives me the choice 2d - > 3d and 2d .
now i wonder what is going on .
why did the panasonic tell me it detected a 3d signal ?
i started from the assumption neither the bluray nor the bluray player had any 3d capability .
