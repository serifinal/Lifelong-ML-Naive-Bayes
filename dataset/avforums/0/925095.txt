hitachi plasma dead ? .
hi i just found this great site whilst trying to find a solution to revive my hitach 55pd5200 .
was wondering if someone could give me some advise .
the tv appears to be dead .
i had someone look at it and ive been told that the fuse has gone on the power board .
is this an easy fix ?
would it be possible to do myself .
im getting quopted silly prices and i really cant afford it at the moment any advice would be greatly appreciated cheers dave
