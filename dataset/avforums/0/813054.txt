nice discovery - vt30 - use cats to your advantage ! .
i 'm using photo mode , all settings at standard , and with cats switched on .
by placing my mobile phone 's led torch in front of the cats sensor , the tv thinks it 's in a permanently bright room and boosts the image to give , in my opinion , brighter whites and all round better quality image .
all i need now is to find a more permanent solution - i 'm thinking a usb fed single white led which are no more than a 3 or 4mm tall , discreetly taped and sealed over the front of the sensor with black tape - so as not to be seen .
for those that do n't know where it is , the sensor is to the left of the power led which is green when the tv is on .
the sensor is clear in colour .
try it , in a dim room .
switch cats off and on , when it 's on you 'll see a noticeable boost in your tvs image .
happy to finally get a permanently brighter image on this tv , which i and many others have always thought to be on the dim side .
