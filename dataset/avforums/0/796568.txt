reflections and glare .
i just wondered why all modern tv 's seem to suffer from quite bad reflections and glare ?
i was in a store the other day looking at different models .
this is under the stores special lighting to highlight the product 's they are selling in the best light .
even under these conditions every single television i looked at sufferent from bad reflections and glare .
even looking at some of the higher quality plasmas from panasonic e.g. the gt and vt versions with the better quality coating i did n't notice much of a difference from the basic models and there was still pretty bad refelections and glare .
what gives ?
no tv 's without reflections and glare ?
will we have to wait for sed and fed tv 's before seeing an improvement on that front ?
if i am spending a lot of money on a tv i do n't want any reflections or glare , especially in subdued lighting in a darker room , but in bright conditions as well would be nice .
