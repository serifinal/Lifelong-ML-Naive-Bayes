smashed tx-p50g30b alternative .
ordered a panasonic tx-p50g30b from currys on friday and had it delivered saturday . .
opened the box and there to find a smashed screen . .
phoned them and they said no problem we have 7 in stock can get another one to you and pick that one up , someone will call you to arrange a time . .
waited until this afternoon to chase it and they said it can take the back office team 48 hours to call me so i will have to wait . .
asked her to check stock levels as noticed it was out of stock online and now they have none sigh ... so trying to pre empt thing a bit now . .
on a `` like for like '' basis what tvs from currys should i accept as a replacement ?
i know like for like has to be on specification but not sure how they are going to read into that . .
the next panasonic is a tx-p50ut30b . .
would that be a wise move or shall i just get my cash back .
i am still mad at how they delivered this screen . .
1 person carrying it above head height . .
absolutely shocking !!
