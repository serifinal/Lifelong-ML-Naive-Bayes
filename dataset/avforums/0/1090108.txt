g20 firmware 2.703 - possible problem .
i have had my g20 since july 2010 and have not had a single problem with it ... .
until now .
the latest firmware update has caused the tv to reboot every few minutes but only when watching freeview .
watching via freesat is not affected .
i have tried a factory reset and this will work for a while but the rebooting eventually returns .
any suggestions please .
