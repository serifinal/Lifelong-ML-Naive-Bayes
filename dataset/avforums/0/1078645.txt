hidden settings ? .
hi i have a panasonic tx-p42s30b and im currnetly struggling with the set up .
i want too have two settings , one for tv one for blu ray , i set up cinema for dvd viewing but changing the mode from cinema to normal / photo / game / true cinema changes more than just the basic settings i can access im assuming its changing the red green blue values too .
is there any way i can access these settings directly ?
-lrb- more advanced settings -rrb- my friends lcd tv has alot more settings available than my plasma thanks
