panasonic plasma th42pz70b weird issue .
recently my panasonic th42pz70b tv has developed an issue with small green lines appearing when light coloured screens are displayed , but it seems fine on darker colours .
i don &#8217; t know what the issue is so haven &#8217; t had much luck on google .
picture attached &#8230; &#8230; let me know if you know what it might be .
note its not the darker green bar across the top , i think that was normal .
