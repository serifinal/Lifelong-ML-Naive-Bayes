blacks -lrb- lack of -rrb- really annoying me .
ok , basically , the shadow is on tv right now , and it 's a pretty dark film .
the screen is mainly just a medium shade of grey and nothing like what i would call black .
i do n't seem to be able to do anything to it to improve the situation either .
this black issue has been slowly bugging me more and more , compounded by the faint grey bars running up the screen on dark scenes .
i went around my friends the other day and his pioneer is just so much better it 's rediculous !
the blacks are almost as black as the bevel .
getting closer and closer to selling this thing for a pioneer !
i know the blacks are n't the best but surely this is something that they could have improved .
i mean , my old hitachi blacks were about the same as this ... and they were one of the reasons i ` upgraded ' .
