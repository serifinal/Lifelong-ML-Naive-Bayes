picture/colour distortion on plasma .
hi just before christmas our samsung lcd tv started playing up , luckily we were still in warranty by about month , so we were able to pick another tv to a certain value .
we have now gone for a 50 '' panasonic plasma tv .
i 'm not sure however if we have a faulty set .
is it normal for a plasma to have colour/picture distortion on fast moving images ??
its quite hard to explain what i mean , all i can compare it to is you know when you press your finger on a calculator screen it goes funny , well its similiar to that as i have never had or watched a plasma tv i have no idea whether this is normal .
sorry to sound so vague !
thanks
