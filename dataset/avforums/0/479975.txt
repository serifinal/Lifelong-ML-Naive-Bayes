hitachi cmpas14s .
hi my 8 year old hitachi cmpas14s , which has never given me any problems up until now , will not turn on .
yesterday i turned the tv onto standby , came back to it 10 mins later and it was totally dead .
no standby lights , no nothing !!
i 've changed the power cable to one that i know is working , so that is n't the problem , but i 've no idea where to start in finding out how to get it working again .
any help would be much appreciated !
thanks no one can give me any clues ?
