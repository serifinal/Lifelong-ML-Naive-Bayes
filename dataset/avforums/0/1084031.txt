panasonic gt30 sound problem .
i have purchased a new panasonic 42gt30 and am very happy with the picture .
however , the sound is a different matter .
after my previous toshiba pf2 crt with built-in sub etc , i understood that the sound would be weaker .
however , i am hearing a particular problem in broadcasts where speech is together with ambient noise - e.g. outside broadcasts .
in these instances , the ambient noise -lrb- wind , traffic , echo , etc -rrb- seems to get very loud in the breaks in speech and then suppressed when the speech begins again .
it creates a rather unpleasant inconsisent ` oscillating ' effect in the sound as if the tv is having trouble mixing the different audio channels somehow -lrb- with the ambient background being often far too loud in the mix -rrb- .
is there a particular reason for this , or is it some kind of fault ?
if its not a fault , should i assume that it would be resolved by using external amp/speakers or would the problem replicate itself ?
any advice would be appreciated .
