disable power button on samsung ? .
hi there , i 'm wondering is it possible to disable the power button at the front of my samsung plasma ?
my 2 year old son is constantly pressing it off and on - and my thinking is that if he sees that pressing the button does n't do anything , then he 'll stop doing it !
i 've looked through the settings menu but ca n't see anything of note .
any assistance would be great !!
it 's a 42 '' model , almost 4 years old , if you need the model number then i can provide that later , thanks !
