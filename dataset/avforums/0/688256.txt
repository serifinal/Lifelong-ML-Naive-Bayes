samsung say fault is actually by design - advice please .
hi i bought a ps63c7000 in september 2010 .
its been fine really since i got it .
i had a slight hdmi issue in feb but samsung came out and swapped the main board and again all was fine .
over the last month i 've noticed a purple haze on the screen that shows itself more against a white back ground as its out of warranty now i have used my barclays extended warranty services and they have put me in touch with service centre .
i phoned them last week and logged a call and the guy took some details .
he called me back today and told me that samsung are aware of the purple haze , say its not an issue and is actually by design .
they cant fix it and basically tough .
please help as i cant see how something that manifests itself over a year after having the set and ruins the use of the set the manufacturer can say oh yeh we knew that was going to happen so tough !!!
