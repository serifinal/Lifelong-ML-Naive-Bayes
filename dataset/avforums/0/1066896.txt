servisol ipa 170 to clean tv screen - yes?no ? .
i 've always used ipa 170 to clean my camera lenses , monitors and tv screens .
but a recent post suggested using it could damaged the anti-reflective coating on my panasonic gt30 .
now , to put this into context , we 're talking about a good clean -lrb- spray/wipe -rrb- with it a few times a year .
certainly not every day or week ... the description for ipa 170 says , `` for use on tape heads , disc drives , photocopier drums , optical equipment , lenses , precision instruments and other delicate components . ''
^ ^ that sounds fairly ok to me ?
but anyone know for sure ?
it 's got me concerned now !
