another possible problem with pv500 .
if the screen is fired with some test rgb screens , or blank backgrounds have noticed that the screen appears to have 2 halves shaded ever so differently the line of separation is exactly across the middle of the screen , whether this is a feature or not or is common to all sets is unknown .
certainly not a good thing .
