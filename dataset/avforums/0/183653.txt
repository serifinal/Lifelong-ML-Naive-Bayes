panasonic 42st30 specific settings .
when setting my st30 up i find any brightness level above 50 % lowers the black level but from calibration shots i need to move two clicks right to get the final box a lighter shade .
any tips on this and can any service menu adjustments help with this ?
i 'm only at about 50 hours will the extra run in time help ?
any advice from a seasoned owner would be massively appreciated so thanks in advance .
regards , andy
