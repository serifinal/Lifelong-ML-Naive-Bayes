is this normal ? .
had my vt20 for about 2 weeks now .
while i absolutely love the tv , there are just a few things that annoy me .
first it has turned its self on and off a few times , there is a very loud buzzing , and there seems to be a black bar down the right side of the screen .
-lrb- for some reason i cant upload any photos at the moment -rrb- .
what shall i do ?
