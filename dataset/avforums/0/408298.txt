samsung ps51d550 audio issues .
hi there .
had this set for a couple of months without issue .
today though there are real issues with the sound .
every few minutes the volume goes completely off .
a few secs later the sound comes back again only a lot louder .
this happens on all channels from what i can see .
i have turned off the auto volume leveler in the menu and that made no difference turning power of then on again makes no difference .
help
