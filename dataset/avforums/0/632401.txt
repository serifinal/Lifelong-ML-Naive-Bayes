first plasma tv - questions within .
i just bought and have installed a panasonic tc-p65gt30 tv .
picture quality looks oustanding -lrb- played a few blue ray movies and it was very crisp -rrb- .
i use time warner cable and they output in 1080i .
i noticed last night that during ending credits of a show etc that would have a black background , there was weird lines that would run across the screen in the black areas .
since i just got it i have not gotten it calibrated and i just kept it on the standard setting -lrb- used thx on my blueray movies though -rrb- .
is this normal and will be able to be adjusted out once i have it calibrated ?
i did not notice this during the blueray movie . .
thanks , gary
