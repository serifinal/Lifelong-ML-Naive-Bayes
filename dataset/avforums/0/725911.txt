panasonic plasmas : black level problems after 1000 hours ?
- part 1 .
just been reading this article from cnet are panasonic plasma tvs losing their dark black levels ?
| crave - cnet it suggests that panasonic plasmas are losing their black levels after a set period due to some type of software timer operation which cuts in to try to extend the panel life time .
it seems panasoinc is the us are aware of the problem according to the posts .
are the uk models also going to suffer from this and has anyone noticed a drop in their black level performance after a 1000 hours ?
if this is true it might be a blow for us with panasonic plasmas and even worse if the new line of plasmas also suffer this .
