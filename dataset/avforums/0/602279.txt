just bought a pdp 4207xd .
ans am i happy !
its the best tv i have watched for years .
i know they are good , but even the basic version like this seems to offer a picture my old lcd could only dream of !
set up in mins .
just watched `` sherlock '' on bbc using the freeview .
bil has just bought one of these all singing dancing lg 's that can not compare for pure image quality !
less than # 200 now , here are a few questions .
what would be the best basic settings for this model ?
i have searched , but it looks like most paid out for the really top models .
i am using a denon dvd cinema system .
its ok ... does what i need etc .
connected via a good -lrb- inox -rrb- scart .
should i be using a component type cable and digital for the sound ?
and how better picture will it give me ?
will keep the hdmi slot for a humax hd tuner pvr etc have only really ever used scarts , also on the back of the denon -lrb- s101 -rrb- it has a switch for the following interlaced , progressive and scart .
again , what do these mean and which should i be using !
and what does `` optical digital out mean ?
thanks ljd
