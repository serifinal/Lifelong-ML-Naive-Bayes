panasonic gt20 game & bluray help . .
hey av , i 've got my gt20 for two days now , and i like the picture quality , but i 'm fairly sure it could be waaaay better .
why you ask ?
i 'm currently using the `` standard '' mode to game & watch blurays ?
for some reason , my tv does n't even have the `` game '' option .
i did enable the professional modes so i have room for two custom modes .
i also turned off intelligent frame correction .
this messes up my digital tv -lrb- images going too fast -rrb- but does this have to be off all time or will it cause jerking when i game ?
to be honest , i 'd like to customise professional mode 1 for blurays/hd television and profession mode 2 for ps3 gaming .
which settings should i use ?
i found `` ok '' settings for movies on the av review but i did n't really find anything gaming related .
