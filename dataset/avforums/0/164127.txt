panasonic txp50g20plasma buzzing .
my panasonic txp50g20 has a background buzzing noise which although not to loud can be heard sometimes over the tv programme .
set is 7-8 months old .
just had currys take it away for repair and it 's come back -lrb- 9days later -rrb- exactly the same .
is this a normal problem and should i go back to them .
the logik tv they lent me while repair was ongoing was silent !
any comments would be appreciated thanks
