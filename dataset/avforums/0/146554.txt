lg plasma 50inch burn .
i did want to update the below thread but is too old to update lg 50pc55 plasma burn i also have a 50inch lg plasma i bought from currys back in march .
it developed a burn image that is the same as the screen saver logo and has burned itself into the centre of the screen , its been there a few months now .
you can only see it in a darkend room you can not see it in daylight .
you can see the cloud when you switch it to an input channel , or is in screensaver mode or when displaying a blank image .
i have had numerous problems with the repair with the know how service by currys .
four repair attempts but have never replaced anything on it that i can see , i have made two complaints and will be booking it in again .
it developed this cloud within the first month , is there anything i can do to try and clear it ?
it definately is a residue of the screensaver logo where the lg logo has moved across the screen .
you can not see it in daylight and despite highlighting this on every repair attempt never gets checked over in a darkened setting so keeps coming back with the same fault .
please can anyone offer any suggestions to a fix i may be able to try ?
even though its at night i do most of my viewing at night , and as it was a high value purchase for me it is grinding me down slowly .
