panasonic tx-p50st31b .
hi i purchased this plasma just over a week ago and first impressions were not great compared to my existing panasonic 50px70b which i have had for three years but have to say after a week am now very pleased i have got the picture set on cinema with contrast set as was standard brightness a couple of clicks up and colour a few clicks down with colour temp at normal vivid colour off c.a.t.s off and pnr off in the advanced menu i have ifc off the re mid sp high 16x9 os on and the po on i am more than happy i think sd images are very good if a little soft at times depending on channel or source but hd images look stunning as does bluray images too 3d looks amazing i love it not thinking i would .
i am running sky hd box sony 580 bluray player onkyo 809 amp which is amazing and qed hdmi-e performance cables speaker wire is qed and speakers are kef eggs 2005.3 i also have a panasonic ptae700 lcd projector hence the 809 which i must say has improved the picture big time compared to my sony 2400es i was running no contest really only bought for the hdmi switching after my denon 3805 was out of date so to speak .
i would just like to say i see a few people have had problems with similar sets but feel i could recommend this plasma to anyone i had this and the gt version side by side and dont feel the extra money is worth it for the gt unless you want more picture modes and set up options i sometimes feel the more you play with the settings the more you never leave them alone anyway if i do experience any probs then i will post but hope i dont .
hope this helps anyone thats put off by bad reports in my opinion go for it its great i have been into av and home cinema for over 15 years now im no expert but i think this tv is worth # 700 of anyones money ...
