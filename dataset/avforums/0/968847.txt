contrast in the blacks - plasma vt30 .
in general , what settings should i use to increase the contrast in the black range on a vt30 ?
i see , only on some programmes , black jackets look like one solid lump of black , some people 's black hair looks like one block of black .
i 'm using thx , with the contrast cranked to about 45 .
all other settings standard with image res enhancer switched off .
i do n't want to increase the brightness because most programmes look good .
any advice on how to improve the black contrast ?
love the level of black , just know there must be some way of unlocking the detail .
tv has done about 200 hours .
