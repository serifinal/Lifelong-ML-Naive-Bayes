pioneer pdp lx5090 red tint to blacks .
hello , i 've had my 5090 since may 2009 , when i got it the screen would look dark grey in a totally dark room , and black with backlighting on .
over the last year this has now changed from grey to red , and is now becoming noticable even with backlighting on .
called pioneer who say this is normal for the screen -lrb- due to the improvements in contrast ratio -rrb- , but they are sending an engineer out anyway to look at it for me .
my set has n't been calibrated , will be asking piers from h.c.e to do that sometime soon .
i have seen one post on this forum about this problem , and quite a few on american and german forums , all of them seem to have had no resolution .
what i do n't want is to be told that this is normal for the screen and left with red looking blacks , so i suppose what i 'd like to know is does anyone else have a screen of this age and does it look red or still grey like mine used to ?
thanks in advance , mick .
