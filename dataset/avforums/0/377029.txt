fujitsu p42/50xha58eb owners thread - part 1 .
hi all .
i 've sat playing with a p50xha58eb for a few hours this morning -lrb- on my week off even -rrb- .
the unit did native res over hdmi at 60hz in eye popping fashion and even gave me a picture at native res 50hz , however at 50hz the picture did shift a bit over to the left and i did not have a scaler of sufficent quality to see if it could be corrected before the unit went out to its eager owner ... .
i have the feeling that front and rear porch settings will have to be worked out eventually ... .
all this via a htpc for reference .
other sources may give differerent results naturally and are well beyond my control a denon all singing and dancing dvd player -lrb- dvd-a1xva -rrb- looked really impressive though ... .
sky hd worked fine at both 720p and 1080i over both component -lrb- 2 inputs -rrb- and hdmi -lrb- two inputs -rrb- .
full precision colour menus are all present along with rs232c and all the usual inputs -lrb- no scart of course -rrb- and correct and that black finish looked nice too ... .
i would have played some more but the customer really wanted delivery tomorrow so i hope he enjoys it , looks like a nice bit of kit to me ... .
i 'll do the same test on a 42 '' model when it arrives next month -lrb- best current guess -rrb- ...
