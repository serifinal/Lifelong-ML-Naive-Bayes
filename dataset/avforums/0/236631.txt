panasonic tx-p55vt30b noise query ?? .
hi , new to the forum so apologies if this question has already been asked or answered .
i 've just got a shiny new panasonic tx-p55vt30b and it seems to have an annoying noise coming from the rear .
there does n't seem to be any pattern to the noise problem , it just appears randomly .
it sounds similar to the ` cricket ' noise you get on holiday ?? .
does anyone have any ideas or have similar experience or cure , all cables are fitted with ferrite cores and are of good quality .
any ideas ... thanks
