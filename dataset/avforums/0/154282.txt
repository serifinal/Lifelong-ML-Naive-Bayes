why is my 1080p plasma showing 720p ? .
i just bought a lg 50pv450 television - 50 '' class 1080p plasma tv when i turn on my hd channels on , it says `` 720p '' at the top of the screen ?
what does this mean ?
i thought my tv was 1080p as it says `` full hd 1080p '' .
i 'm new to all this tv lingo so forgive me if i 'm asking something that has already been answered .
one more thing ... what are the best setting for my tv ?
there are so many options that i have no clue what my tv settings should be on ?
thanks for all the help !
