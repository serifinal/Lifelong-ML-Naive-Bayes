panasonic p46s20b overscan problem ? .
i 've just upgraded from a panasonic 32 '' 1080p lcd to the p46s20b 46 '' plasma -lrb- gorgeous -rrb- .
my mac mini is connected -lrb- dvi - > hdmi -rrb- to an onkyo sr607 av receiver which is subsequently connected to the panasonic via hdmi .
things had been working perfectly with my old tv .
since swapping the tvs over , i ca n't get the mac mini resolution right .
the mac 's display settings are set to 1080p .
what 's happening is that the edges are being clipped off the screen when the tv is in any mode except ` game ' -lrb- in this mode everything is fine -rrb- .
i have tried toggling the mac and the panasonic 's ` overscan ' modes in various combinations to no avail .
the screen momentarily looks ok but then -lrb- after a few seconds -rrb- reverts to having the edges clipped off .
i 'd really rather use the tv 's ` cinema ' or ` true cinema ' modes as the colours are better but unless i use the ` game ' mode the picture is clipped .
does anyone know what might be causing this ??
thanks , fielddoc
