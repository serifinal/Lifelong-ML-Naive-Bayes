too many owners threads on this board now .
most of the first page of this plasma forum is taken up with owners threads .
i 'm definitely not having a go but is n't it time avforums had its own owners thread board for each category ?
i think it 'd free up a lot of space for more general questions on here .
just a thought , dont shoot me down !
