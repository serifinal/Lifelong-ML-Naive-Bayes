samsung ps-42p2s - speakers making static noise ? .
i have just set up this tv and at first no sound was coming out of the tv .
now it is making static noises .
sometimes you can just work out the noise coming from the telly otherwise its an awful sound !!!
i do n't think i have set it up properly as the telly has detachable speakers .
could i have wired it up wrong .
any help , advice or guidance gratefully received !!!
