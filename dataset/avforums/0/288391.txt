pioneer krp-600m picture judder .
hi , i have a denon bdp3800 blu ray attached to my pioneer and have been really pleased with it .
however , after watching a friends -lrb- cheaper -rrb- set up i have since noticed definate horizontal and vertical picture judder which seems particularly noticeable on opening or closing credits .
have just watched luc besson 's adele blanc sec and the side scrolling opening sequnce shows a lot of judder .
i 'm not sure what to check first , my blu ray settings or pioneer settings .
any suggestions would be grateful .
