panasonic gt30 - getting professional mode to look as good as thx mode ? .
i think thx mode produces the nicest image for me .
the contrast and quality of the image is just to my liking , except some skin tones , especially in fast moving scenes , seem to produce a slight green hue which i find distracting .
i 've been trying to get my professional mode set to result in a thx like image , but i just ca n't get there .
that said , i 've not delved into the deeper ` advanced settings ' as i do n't really know what they do .
is there anyone -lrb- preferably with a 46 `` gt30 -rrb- who 's got a professional setting that they think matches thx who can share their settings ?
at least for me to try and/or use as a starting point ?
i 've played around with gamma and the brightness , colour and contrast and got fairly close , but the contrast just does n't seem as good as thx , and that 's with contrast set to max too !
ps : why would anyone have sharpness set to anything except max ?
