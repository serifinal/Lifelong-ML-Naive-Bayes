panasonic g15 series thread .
so , i have n't seen these discussed much lately , i 'm not sure whether that 's because they are n't as cost-effective as the g10 or as well-featured as the v10 .

seems like it 's only coming in 42 '' and 46 '' sizes though , no 50 '' planned .
so what 's peoples thoughts on this .
anyone know if the eu version will have the advanced calibration options enabled like the eu g10 models ?
