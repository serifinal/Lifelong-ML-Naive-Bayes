how to get rid of letterbox panasonic u30 .
hi .
i have recently started renting movies and have noticed that a lot of the movies have letterboxing .
now , i usually would n't mind this but because my new tv is a plasma , i do n't want to risk screen burn/ir .
i am running blu-ray discs on my ps3 .
i know there is some way to at least make the letterboxing lighter so there is less risk but i do n't know how .
can anyone help me get rid of letterboxing/making it brighter on my panasonic tx-p42u30 on ps3 ?
thanks alot
