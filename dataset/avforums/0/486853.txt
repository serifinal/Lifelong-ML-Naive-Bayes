comparrison : panasonic 42 '' v20 & g30 .
while i know the v20 is last year 's i was wondering on how the pic compares on these sets for those that have seen them both .
the freesat hd tuner on the v20 will make no difference to me at all , just pic & sound quality .
-lrb- this is gon na be a 2nd tv though for the bedroom -rrb-
