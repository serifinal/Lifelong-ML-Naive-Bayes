panasonic view tv in tv listings .
hi all , just a very quick question ... .
i have a panasonic viera -lrb- txp42s21b -rrb- .
it would appear that i am unable to continue to watch the tv whilst searching the guide ??? the screen is full of the listings and the sound vanishes ??? on over tv 's that i have owned you are able to maintain watching/hearing the channels - i have searched through the manual to no avail .
one other question - on the guide , there are two boxes to the left hand side that simply say '' viera '' - are these meant to do anything ??? it looks like they should be doing something ??? any help that you can offer is greatly appreciated .
many thanks for your help in advance and have a great new year cheers tony
