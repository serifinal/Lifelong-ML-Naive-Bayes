my lg plasma 42pc1rr is dead .
i am -lrb- still -rrb- the owner of tv lg plasma 42pc1rr .
i bought it in june 2007 in belgrade -lrb- serbia -rrb- and two weeks ago suddenly appeared dark -lrb- black -rrb- fields on the display .
these fields cover black appearances during current broadcasting , and when they are changing black fields are slowly disappearing and then appear on other black -lrb- dark -rrb- appearances during tv program .
few servicemen explained me that plasma display was definitely dead and that any repair is too expensive -lrb- authorised repair services of lg in serbia is terrible and shameful so i did not want to entrust them repairing of tv -rrb- .
it means , after only 4 years of normal use , tv set i paid 1100 eur , is to end in garbage .
next time i will not buy any lg apparatus .
