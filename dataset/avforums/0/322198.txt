panasonic txp46g20 .
hi all !
if you own one of these , can you please advise me what the sound is like in a normal living environment -lrb- ie living room -rrb- ?
i was listening to one in richer sounds and thought it sounded tinny .
i will try and get to listen to one of these in a demo room to see if it was down to it being in the store .
i did like the picture and the more natural colours though
