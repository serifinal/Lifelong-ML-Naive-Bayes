plasma questions . .
-lrb- me again -rrb- .
i received my 46 '' gt30 yesterday and i do n't know if i 'm being fussy , or having problems . .
i have a few questions , could anyone help ?
q1 .
when watching blu rays -lrb- from 6-7-8 feet away -rrb- i can actually see . .
dots .
for e.g. in dark knight -lrb- blu ray on ps3 -rrb- when the joker storms wayne party and batman shows up .
when the light shines onto his cowl you can see the black is made up of tiny multiple coloured squares rather than a blended in colour .
am i sitting too close/bought a tv too big ?
the brighter i make the screen the worse it gets .
another e.g. is in kickass .
when big daddy is sat painting the camera hovers over a drawn face which is made up of browns .
in the brown you can actually see pixels moving about .
when you pause the blu ray the pixels pause too .
this isnt a pictyure from my tv its one i found on the net .
while my tv isnt as bad these are the ` dots ' im talking about .
