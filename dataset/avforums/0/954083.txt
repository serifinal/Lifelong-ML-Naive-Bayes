plasma tv problem .
my lg plasma tv is not powering on via the original remote control or the cable remote control , however when i touch the power button at the base of the tv , it responds and turns on , but now when i turn off the tv by hitting the power button on either remote , it turns off and not on .
this is an urgent situation and i can not figure out what is wrong .
if anyone can assist i would greatly appreciate it .
