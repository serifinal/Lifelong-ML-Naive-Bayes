radio interference from plasma screen .
i am concerned about radio interference caused by plasma screens and want to know : 1 -rrb- whether there is any health risk e.g. for young children from watching plasma screen for a long period of time ?
2 -rrb- whether there is any easy way to reduce or prevent interference from affecting my next door neighbour ?
just being ` cautious ' as usual , but would be really grateful for any information/reassurance .
many thanks
