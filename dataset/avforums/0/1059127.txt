panasonic with no hdmi or scart .
after coming back from holiday to find my sky hd box has died , i also found that so has my plasma .
well , when i say died , it kind of has !
the hdmi and scart inputs dont work .
i can plug in a coaxial and recieve normal tv and the built in freeview works , but if you plug anything into either the hdmi or scart ports nothing happens .
has anyone ever had any problems like this before or know of what could cause it ?
its a panasonic 46 '' plasma .
around 2 years old .
model th-46pz85b thank you in advance
