end of the road for plasma ? .
friend of mine works for sony and i 've been talking to him for months about the lcd v plasma debate and here is an excerpt from an email he sent me yesterday : **** during ' 06 we will cease production of crt and plasma products completely as will many of our competitors .
plasma will probably disappear next year generally , as older sets are now failing fast with screen burn and system is becoming too expensive to produce and service in comparison to lcd .
**** looks like the begining of the end for plasma as lcd gets better by the day it seems .
thoughts please ...
