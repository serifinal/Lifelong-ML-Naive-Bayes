samsung ps50c680 problem .
hi , recently i entered the hotel mode mute-1-1-9-enter and followed the steps online to enter the extended menus .
i enabled the 24p thingy and also srs tru sound/equalizer .
i exited that setup menu , powered off the tv and then powered back on and now i have a problem with my remote ... arghhhh the numeric buttons dont function , either does source , prog up/down and ch list , although the tv picks up the ir signal from those buttons indicated by the light on the tv .
please can someone help with this issue
