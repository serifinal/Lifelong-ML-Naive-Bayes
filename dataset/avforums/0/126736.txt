panasonic viera thp50u30d brightness issue .
hi , i bought ?
viera th-p50u30d ?
2 days back .
i see an issue with ?
brightness ? .
it either increase or decrease a bit -lrb- noticeably -rrb- during scenes changeovers.it does n't happen for all scenes but for some .
i read about ?
picture mode ?
in manual - it says ?
contrast ?
, ?
black ?
and ?
color ?
reproduction happens in ?
cinema ?
mode .
hence , i tried setting to ?
true cinema ?
mode where no revision happen .
but , no luck .
the ?
brightness ?
change is still visible during few scenes changeovers . .
i can say i see something like this video .
not this much , but noticeable !
is this how it works ?
thanks in advance for your inputs ... - dilip
