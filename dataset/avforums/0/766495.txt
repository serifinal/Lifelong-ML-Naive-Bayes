akai pdp5073tm - power issue , starts then stops twice .
i just got a free akai 50 '' plasma from a friend because it was taking up space and he didnt know what to do with it .
now i realize the brand and how some hate it and all of the blah blah blah .
but i really dont care about the opinions of whether the brand is good or not .
what i do want to do is stay on topic and fix this thing .
i feel compelled to bring it back to life .
bit of an obsessive hobby now lol .
when i turn the tv on it starts to boot for a second , then stops .
then tries again and stops again .
i removed the back panel and watched it as i turned the power on .
both fans start to spin , a green led on a small board next to the power board lights up , then everything turns off .
a second or two after they shut off -lrb- fans and led -rrb- , they again do the same thing of starting and shutting off .
they then stay off .
i have absolutely zero experience with plasma tvs .
the extent of my experience is converting a bad backlight on an hp monitor to led after the ccfls burned out .
thx !
any help would be appreciated !
