pioneer pdp lx5090 - how does it rate now ? .
as the title suggests , how does this tv rate now against the current crop of plasmas and lcd 's on offer ?
i have owned this tv for a couple of years now and feel that it has improved with age .
it was muted as the ` best ' tv when it was first released but has it been superseded and if so by what ?
just interested in case i feel the need to replace it !
