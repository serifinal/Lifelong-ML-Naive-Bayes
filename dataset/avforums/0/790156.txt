gone back to vt20 .
just an update for those interested .
had a vt20 for a few weeks but was n't happy with the 50hz issue .
it was swopped for a vt30 which had 50hz , green splodge , fb and pixelation so it went back .
looked at samsung and lg but both had their problems .
the samsung 51 '' 8000 had judder and i did n't rate the pq as well as the vt20 .
the lg 50 '' pz950 had much less judder but the blacks were n't good enough and the pq was n't up to the vt20 .
so now . .
with no other options really we 've gone back to the original vt20 and i must say that the pq is so much better than everything else we 've looked at .
we are now happy enough the stick with the vt20 and put up with the 50hz issue .
it 's just a shame that no-one seems to be able to make a 50 '' plasma that does n't have judder but also has good blacks .
we read that there are people on here who have exchanged their tv 5 or 6 times before settling on one that `` will have to do '' i 'm stunned that in 2011 there 's no such thing as a perfect plasma -lrb- whatever you get has one issue or another -rrb- and i must say that buying the first new tv after 11 years has been a complete nightmare .
right . .
i 'm off to watch something on the tv that we 've settled on .
