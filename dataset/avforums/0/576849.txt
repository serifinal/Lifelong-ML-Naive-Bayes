the best aspect of picture quality on my plasma is ... .
let 's all leave the problems behind for a moment and concentrate on why we enjoy our screens .
assumption time .
we are all keen on our various plasma sets and place picture quality very high on our list of importance .
we all have different tastes but probably steer ourselves towards accuracy , hence all the threads and discussions on settings .
lcd/led owners can probably state vibrancy of colours , sharpness etc. but we , as plasma owners , can see beyond this and strive for natural , film like properties from our displays .
i have a pioneer lx5090 in the living room , a panasonic tx-p50vt30b in the back room and a panasonic tx-42pz85 in the bedroom .
it is the pioneer that i will speak of .
i really struggled to follow advice to reduce sharpness .
it seemed to contradict the fact that 1080p was all about definition .
of course i now appreciate that definition and sharpness and two seperate entities .
looking at real life , i never see sharp edges but having very good eyesight , notice lots of detail .
to this end , i am comfortable with sharpness at -7 .
what i really love above all else about the 5090 is its handling of texture .
there is great detail without any sharp edges , and eveything looks realistic .
it wo n't grab your attention in a few moments but everything looks realistic .
hair looks like hair , metal like metal , wood like wood and the major one for me - i do n't have to talk about skin tones but rather the fact that skin looks like skin .
some is wrinkled and craggy , some smooth and some covered in powder make up .
nearly two years in , i still find myself stopping to marvel at the texture information available .
just to put things in context , my sources are blu ray but mainly sky hd .
for sky , the picture is obviously as variable as the number of channels .
i only watch hd channels .
what are your favourite aspects of your particular screen ?
