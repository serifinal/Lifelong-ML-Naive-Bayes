coloured vertical bars on lg 50pg3000 .
hello .
i have a problem with my brothers lg 50pg3000 .
as you can see from the pictures there are coloured bars on the screen .
these differ slightly every time the set is turned on .
they go over everything including the menus .
the middle light on the lvds is green .
not sure what that means .
i have removed the lvds and re balled the rom .
this has had no effect .
could it still be that we need a new lvds board ?
any advice offered would be greatly appreciated .
