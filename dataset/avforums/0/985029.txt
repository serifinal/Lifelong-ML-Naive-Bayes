panasonic 42px70 remote stopped working , nearly . .
yesterday my tv remote stopped working properly .
most of the buttons are now not working at all .
the few that are only have limited function .
ie , the av button works to select input if you keep pressing it to move down , but the direction buttons have no movement at all .
same for guide , menu , volume etc. .
changed the batteries to brand new ones , turned it off at the plug for at least 5 minutes , but still the same .
my sky hd remote works fine with the tv with limited functions of a sky remote though ?
anyone got any ideas ?
is it just the remote ?
or something more sinister ... .
i bought it from john lewis on 15/4/2007 , so i am still in warranty , just !?!?!?
