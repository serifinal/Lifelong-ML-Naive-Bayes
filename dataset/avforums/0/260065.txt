how do i get to the cooling fans in my plasma to get the dust out ? .
the cooling fans in my panny plasma are thick with dust .
although i regularly vacuum the grills , i ca n't get to the fans themselves .
can i safely get to them and give them a vacuum by taking the screws off at the back , or is this not advisable ?
is there another way to do it ?
thanks in advance for your help
