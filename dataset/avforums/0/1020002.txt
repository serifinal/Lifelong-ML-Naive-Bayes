pioneer media receiver cable .
hi i have a pioneer pdp 434pe and recently bought a used replacement r04e media receiver cable .
however the standard pda-h01 cable works on the dvi side but as soon as you plug in the control cable the whole thing shuts down .
the pioneer manual for my tv talks of a system cable -lrb- 3 m -rrb- -lrb- adf1021 -rrb- .
can anyone tell me if this is the same cable ?
