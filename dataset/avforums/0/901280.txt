lg 50pz250t - response time ? .
instead of doing some research beforehand , i stupidly bought this television in august as soon as i was able to afford a decent one .
it is fantastic for everything except the one thing i wanted to use it for most : gaming .
it seems to have quite problematic latency issues , and as a result any game which requires a split-second response becomes almost unplayable .
this is pretty much every online multiplayer console game .
i have to move the ps3 back into another room and hook it up to a 24 '' monitor in order to play battlefield 3 or fifa .
richer sounds claim on their website that the `` 600hz technology gives a superb response ... '' , yet in their technical specifications the response time is labelled ` na ' !
it would appear it is most definitely applicable !
comet list it as having a 5ms response time but it just does not feel like that is the case .
i had heard in general plasmas have a better response time than lcd/leds , is this a myth ?
is there a setting somewhere i 'm missing which would help or am i **** out of luck ?
i am seriously considering selling it , even for a smaller size with a better response time .
cheers !
