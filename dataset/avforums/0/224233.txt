lg50px990 dse .
hi everyone .
i have a lg50px990 and i have had it just over a year now , i am happy with the picture both sd and hd material but it always has this dirty screen effect but only on bright back grounds as the picture moves slowly .
when i first got it i had a lg engineer round and said these type of new plasmas suffer from it and over time it has got better but you can still see it , also it some times has line bleed when you get the credits come up or when these a edge behind someone on the tv but it 's not to bad .
so over the past few weeks i have been looking for a better tv like a gt30 or a sammy d7000 but both seem to have there own problems , so any advice will be very welcome , thanks .
