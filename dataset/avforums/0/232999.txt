lg 50pk590 fault .
good afternoon i have a fault on my lg50pk590 screen -lrb- images attached -rrb- .
there is a black band approx 2 inch thick with `` sparkles '' .
the unit is under richer sounds 5 year warranty -lrb- 16 months old -rrb- .
they are picking the set up on wednesday to check the fault .
do you think it is repairable or will it be written off ?
if it is written off does anyone know how there replacements work , do i get to choose a model upto a cash limit or do they choose ?
thank you for your help
