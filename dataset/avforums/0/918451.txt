how to connect receiver so hdmi inputs are mapped correctly ? .
i have a panasonic plasma directly connected via 2 hdmi cables to sky hd and ps3 respectively on hdmi 1 and hdmi 2 .
these are also mapped on my logitech -lrb- all in one remote -rrb- .
no receiver is being used .
i am soon to be upgrading to a 5.1 surround system complete with av receiver and speakers .
i noticed that the receiver has 3 hdmi inputs but only one hdmi .
will the remote and tv correctly map the right hdmi port to the right source ?
