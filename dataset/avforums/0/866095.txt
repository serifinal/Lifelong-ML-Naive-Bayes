black bars and image retention .
hi all just got a new p42st30 and loving it .
run up around 90 hours of viewing thus far .
viewing in true cinema and zooming in to avoid static images , black bars , etc. .
this is my first plasma .
just noticed today when i started to watch my first 3d blu ray -lrb- captain america -rrb- that i could n't use the aspect button on the remote to get rid of the black bars .
changed to 2d but still unable to change aspect or zoom black bars away .
consequently , i have a few questions and would really appreciate some input : is there some other way of getting rid of the black bars ?
seems like the blu ray wo n't play any other way than with black bars and i 'm afraid of getting image retention if i play the disc .
if not , and i view with black bars , do i run the risk of getting some image retention ?
what have others found when viewing movies with black bars ?
is there a point when one does n't have to worry about watching movies with black bars ?
i hope so , as i do n't want to be constantly worried about image retention when watching movies that seem to be resistant to the aspect button .
appreciate any input .
