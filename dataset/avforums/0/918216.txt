lg 60pz950t .
hi all , i took delivery on friday on my 60 inch pz and i can say it was well worth waiting instead of getting the px model , the magic motion remote is a cool gadget for getting around the tv on the internet typing in letters , the games on the apps are a cool idea just need some decent ones , but when it comes to 3d it is amazing the depth is mad !
i have been watching tennis which started on eurosport3d on sunday 22nd , the glasses do n't loose sync at all and no crosstalk whatsoever !
the only problem is you only get one pair and they are not released yet i spoke to lg yesterday and he said they did n't have a release date ?
good news they do kids glasses ags230 and designer ones asg270 made of metal .
if anyone wants any photos sent please do n't hesitate
