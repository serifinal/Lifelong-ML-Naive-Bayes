		<Content>Just purchased a 42" Panasonic Viera Plasma screen but need to replace the power cord with something around 5m in length. The current cable just looks like a lead for a kettle I think but about 2 inches from the end that connects to the tv there is a barrel like part that the cable passes through...can someone point me in the right direction please and maybe somewhere to buy it from. Also need 2 HDMI cables of the same length and want to spend no more than Â£10 on each, any ideas? Is the quality on these the same as with scart cables or can't I go wrong really? Many thanks for any advice.</Content>
