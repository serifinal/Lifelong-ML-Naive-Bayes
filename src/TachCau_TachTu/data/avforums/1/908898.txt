		<Content>Are all modern Plasma's capable of displaying both NTSC and PAL video on the actual screen? (apart from the in-built tuner for live TV which is obviously PAL only). Because I have lots american AV equipment, DVD's and games consoles and I'm buying a UK TV, will they work? Old PAL TV's used to go grey when fed with NTSC video. Thanks</Content>
