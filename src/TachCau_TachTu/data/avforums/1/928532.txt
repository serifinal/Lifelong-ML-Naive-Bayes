		<Content>Hi I'm thinking of buying a 65 inch plasma and am looking at the Panasonic TXP65VT30B. Reading about some 50hz issues and ?floating blacks has left me a little worried. Does anybody have knowledge of this model or indeed perhaps suggest another 65 inch screen that maybe better? Thanks</Content>
