		<Content>Hi guys, I'm getting an urge to get a bigger, full HD screen to replace my faithful old 42" 720p Samsung (forget the model number!). Not wanting to spend a fortune and the two that have caught my eye are the Panasonic TX-P50U30B and the LG 50PV350T. My instinct says "Get the Viera", but the LG is a) A bit cheaper, b) the specs report higher contrast, and c) It looks really nice (almost LED-thin). Has anyone any experience of (preferably both!) of these? Cheers,</Content>
