		<Content>I'd really like to upgrade to a 65inch screen. There doesn't seem to be a single TV out there that doesn't have major issues. I don't mean that no TV has perfect attributes ie contrast etc but issues like fluctuating brightness or peeling screens! Why can nobody make a 65 inch screen that doesn't have a major flaw??</Content>
