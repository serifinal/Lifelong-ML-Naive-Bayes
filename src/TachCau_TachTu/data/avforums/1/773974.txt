		<Content>Hi, Firstly, the title is not a ditch to plasma. As i have always been a plasma user. The common problem i seem to be having with my set is buzzing pixels, dithering pixels, fuzzy pixels, static, .... Call it what you will... I dont know the correct term all i percieve it as is annoyance! Hindring and irritating. I have spent 5hours today, trying to ensure a quality picture on my samsung plasma ps50c680... my bluray player (bd-c5900)... I used resident evil afterlife as my test disc to start and it seemed great! Not too many flaws at all, not too much buzzing or pixels goin mad... Though felt the image was quite flat n lacked punch so i tried turning the sharpness up and wow! What ahiidden gem! ... It really made the set looked great and clear!... I left sharpness at 45... My contrast around 89 n brightness at 54...cell light is at 15, i use 24fps on player and dep colour... On the tv, i use warm2, screen fit, dynamic contrast off!, colour 50, edge enhancement off, cinema smooth on!.... Any lower on brightness and im just crushing shadows ..ideally idlike it higher but i seem to wash out blacks! Anyway, then i tried same settings for daredevil bluray... Oh dear! On the cafe scene when elektra walksin i have almosts fuzzing dots around wall patches, smoke from kettles turning into what looks like pixel static on my screen.... What the hell! I have tried EVVERYTHING to get rid of this yet it wont go away, it may marginally improve but barely!... So is this the disc?!.. The player i have?! Or the tv?!... Does anyone get what i experience on there plasma? This seems to not be mentioned of often enough it appears ... No disc is 100% free from this as resident evil had it mildly in places but daredevil seemed awful.. I have tested other blus and get this too Any ideas? I would love someone to clear this up for me as it is a real pet hate for me! Oh too add, im sat about 7-8 feet back...roughly...</Content>
