		<Content>I'm pretty much decided on getting a 42" VT30, and I settled on 42" because it was the biggest my wife would agree to. However... looking at a paper cut out of a 42" screen, I'm not sure it actually gives me a larger perceived viewing area / viewing angle - maybe a few degrees. Take a look at the pic and see if you think it's worth having? Photos is from the seating position, which is 11.5 feet from the wall.</Content>
