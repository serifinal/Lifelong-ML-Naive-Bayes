		<Content>Hi, I am very close to buying a Samsung PS51D6900 plasma.... I think that is upscales 50hz to 100hz? Such as pal TV etc? So if I set an Xbox or PS3 or PC output to 50hz will the TV automatically switch to 100hz thus eliminating flicker? Please get back to me if you know asap thanks!</Content>
