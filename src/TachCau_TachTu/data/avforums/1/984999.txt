		<Content>Looking at getting this TV but have seen a few posts around the web saying its got a bad lag and therfore not the best for gaming and Im hoping to be plugging in my PS3 once arrived since its a bit bigger than my existing sammy le46c750. I've seen a few post regarding the pk590 being a good TV but what is it like for FPS black ops / MOH etc? If there is a drawbacks is there a good alternative? Many Thanks</Content>
