		<Content>HI, I am hesitating between those two models, one of each being 3D but I am not really bothered about this feature but more about the rest, I have looked at their specs and they looks pretty the same to me with small differences. I was wondering whether it was worth going for the G30 series when I could get a 3D S30 series for Â£150 less and nearly the same specs, so confusing! What do you think between them both? which one would you go for? thanks</Content>
