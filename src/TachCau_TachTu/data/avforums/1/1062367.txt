		<Content>Hi Have a 5 year old Panasonic Plasma and have had my heart set on getting a VT30 50 inch but now after reading all the negative posts i am not so sure so my question is what other tv's should i be looking at or should i take the plunge and hope for the best and get a VT30 as i can't believe they are all faulty.
