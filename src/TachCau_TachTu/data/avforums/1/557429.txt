		<Content>I'm getting my new 3d LED tv tomorrow and have sold my 50" panasonic plasma to a colleague. I have offered to transport the tv as shes paid a reasonable price but I havent transported one this big before. Am I best to lay it screen down or screen up on a thick duvet and same question for storage till I transport it. Other option is try and fit it in new tv box for transport?? Any ideas??</Content>
