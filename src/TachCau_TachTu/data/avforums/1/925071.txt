		<Content>Hi, I'm unsure which tv to get, I understand Panasonic have a very well known reputation for good quality TV's. up there in the top! I'm unsure between a panasonic TH-42PZ70B I can get hold of or wait it out and get a 50" newer tv, which will most likely be some cheaper model. The Panasonic has GREAT reviews, and is 42" The other tv I would have in mind is some form of cheaper 50" tv. I will mainly be watching SD movies and occasional tv. My only concern is that the panasonic is 'old' technoloy almost? Its a good few years old the tv. The contrast ratio of 10,000 to 1. Even though its had great reviews, in comparison to 50" tv's with 3 MILLION to 1, the 10,000 seems really... low? Maybe someone else can make sence! I just want the best I can afford! argh!</Content>
