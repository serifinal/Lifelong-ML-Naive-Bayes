		<Content>This is obviously a newbie question. I am trying to figure out whether plasma or LCD is the correct format for my situation. My viewing distance is only about 6 to 8 feet. With a 27 inch SD TV, if I look, I can see the interlacing line structure of the picture. I am thinking that a 42 " widesrceen would be a nice size because it keeps the same approximate height of screen image. What concerns me, though, is that the pixel size of a plasma is visible at this short viewing distance. I was wondering what people consider as a minimum viewing distance for a plasma.</Content>
