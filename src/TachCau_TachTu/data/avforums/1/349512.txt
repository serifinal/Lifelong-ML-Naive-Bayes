		<Content>Hi there, I'm looking to buy a 50 inch or above plasma tv around the £1000 mark, but idealy I'd rather pay £700 - £800 depending on what you can get. I'd be using it for a lot of gaming, blu ray films etc. 3D would also be nice. So I was just wondering what tv would be best to buy in the UK? Thanks</Content>
