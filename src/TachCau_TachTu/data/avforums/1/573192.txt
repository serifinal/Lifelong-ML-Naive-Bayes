		<Content>Basically since I had this set last year I've had a few niggles with it. I've tried living with them but have now decided I want a set that does everything I want it to, unlike this one sadly. John Lewis will replace the set for an equivalent model (about Â£2K) and I do like Panasonic, as I had a 42" plasma before this one that was superb. What's the best put there now?</Content>
