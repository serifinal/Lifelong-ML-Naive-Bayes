		<Content>Probably not the place to post this but i'll give it a go Im going to order a Panny TX-P42U30B for amazon for £434.90. great price, but it says it wont be dispatched for two months! is this true? or is it shipped out earlier than this? I can spend an extra £50 and i'll have it by the end of the week if i buy from another shop that Amazon is also advertising but... £434 is already alot</Content>
