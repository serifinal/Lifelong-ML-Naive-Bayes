		<Content>Im buying a tv for gaming only. I found this Panasonic TX-P42C3 wich has only 16ms of input lag! My concern is that xbox360 games are 1080p fullHD and this tv is only 720p HD(not even "trueHD", only 1024 x 768) When the TV processes the picture from xbox to screen, does it have to somehow scale the image size so it would INCREASE the input lag, cause thats what I really dont want to happen?! I would really appreciate if someone who knows something about this could answer.</Content>
