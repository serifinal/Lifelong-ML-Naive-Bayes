		<Content>Hi everyone, So I finally decided to pull the trigger and purchase a new TV. After much research I went for the new Panasonic TX-P42GT30B for it's reported picture quality and as per the Plasma technology, the 'inky' black levels. The picture quality is very impressive on the TV, apart from the black levels. Basically I'm trying to find out whether the set is displaying what it should and all this talk of 'inky' black levels on Plasma sets has all been totally overblown or whether I have a set that is not doing what it should be doing. To give a little more detail. When I am watching the set in a completely dark room with no light source. The deepest black the TV is displaying is a darkish grey. I have tried every setting and this is the deepest it can go. This darkish grey is nowhere near an 'inky' black that I have seen advertised for this particular TV or indeed any Plasma television. There is absolutely no chance of the black level being confused with the black bezel of the TV that's for sure. When I first turned the set on with the lights off, I was expecting an ever so slight increase in the black that you would see when the screen is completely switched off. Or maybe even it wouldn't be obvious that the TV was even on. That was the kind of black level I was expecting, something that could rival the 'is it on'? quality you could get from the old CRT tech. But no, unfortunately the grey of the deepest 'black' is not really that much better than an LCD I owned 5 years ago (that had an issue with blurry xbox games and was sent back) To be honest, I'm disappointed. I truly believed that Plasma technology was starting to rival CRT the way people had talked. But from what I'm seeing, it's nowhere near. It's a darkish grey. Is this normal? Was I just expecting too much from this TV and the Plasma tech? Or does it sound like I might have a defective TV? I would appreciate any help with this. And please no comments on how good Kuros are at black levels. Because that is of no use to me. Thank You.</Content>
