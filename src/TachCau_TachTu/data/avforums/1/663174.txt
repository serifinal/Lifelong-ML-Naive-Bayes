		<Content>HI, I have a TX-P50G20B UK Panasonic. Unfortunately it does not have the DVB-C functionality. Actually I notice that DVB-C is available for a specific list of countries for the same model: DVB-C feature is available only in following countries: / Sweden (ComHem, Canal Digital), Demark (YouSee)... How can I add this functionality to my UK version of the G20? Do I need to add an additional hardware module to support DVB-C? Is it real to be done? Where can I buy it? I would replace DVB-S or DVB-T with DVB-C in my case. I know, here are lot of expects on this forum. I really need your help as I need the DVB-C functionality on my TV. Thank you very much.</Content>
