		<Content>ok guys im in the market for a new tv and i like the look of these two. both have a lan port but i can only find info on the 590 model saying its dlna compatable which is important to me. also the 590 has 2 more hdmi connections one is £550 and the other just under £600 so its the max i want to pay, reading up on here the tv's both sound ideal but since theyve been out a while now, does anyone have any negative thoughts since theyve owned one for a while OR can i get better for the SAME money (not a penny more ) its for watching football and blurays</Content>
