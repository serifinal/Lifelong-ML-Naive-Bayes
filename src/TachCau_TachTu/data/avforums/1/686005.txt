		<Content>OK I have a Panny 42GT30 and an Onkyo AVR (NR609). All is good and I have got the ARC working when the TV is in net mode (BBC iPlayer and the like). Problem: When the TV starts up, it starts in "Internal Freesat" mode. I have changed the prefered mode from TV to AV and this works every now and then. In the manual it says the AV will be prefered when a signal is present (there definitely is). Any ideas anyone? Is there any way to force the TV to start on the last used input? TBH it seems a strange way to do things e.g. have the TV default to a freesat internal, rather than default to a "Last Used" input. lets be right who is going to pay Â£1,000+ for a Plasma HD 3D TV to watch freesat?!?!?!? thanks</Content>
