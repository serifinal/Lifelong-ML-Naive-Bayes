		<Content>http://www.johnlewis.com/231222456/Product.aspx I've been looking at buying this for a while and I'm just after some opinions if anyone has bought it and could tell me what they think of it and if they are happy with their purchase. I was also a bit concerned with "burn in" could anyone help to convince me that I won't just ruin my tv with burn in? Is it hard to do and / easy to avoid? Thank you very much for any help you are able to give me either on Burn in or the actual tv itself. James</Content>
