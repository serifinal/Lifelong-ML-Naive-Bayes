		<Content>I am on the verge of buying a TV (gt30) yet I'm worried I'm going to buy the wrong size. I will be sitting approx between 6 feet and 7 and a half foot away (90") I was first going to buy a 42inch, until I heard that a 46 inch would be better for the distance I was going to be viewing the TV from. Then the TV shop salesman told me that 50inch would be better.. I then read on a website that sitting less than 9 feet with a 46inch will make the images look pixleated. I went onto yahoo answers (didn't want to keep bothering you with my questions :P) and every one on there said 42 inch would be more than fine and 46 would be pushing it.. I've now found a calculator site Screen size vs. seating dist. - FlatpanelsHD That I would be better off with a 50Inch... I'm getting really sick and tired of reading SO many different conflicting documents/reviews/posts Can anyone PLEASE just tell me if I'll be okay viewing a 46inch TV at around 6-8 feet away? I don't care if I don't get 100% benefit but 90% would be fine. Will I be able to tell the diff between 720p and 1080P? Will I get the benefit of a bluray etc? I hardly watch TV (unless the world cup is on..) but I do watch allot of SD DVD (upscaled with ps3) and bluray. I have been to a shop where you could test out diff viewing distance. However they had a HUGE window in front of the TV so looking at the detail was impossible. Would I be better off with a 42,46 or 50inch TV? the 50 inch is WAY out of my price range tbh (I'm going for the GT30) and the 46 is out of my price range but manageable.</Content>
