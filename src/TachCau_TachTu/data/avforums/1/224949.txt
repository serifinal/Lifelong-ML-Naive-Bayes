		<Content>Hi, I'm in need of some advice for buying a plasma TV. At the moment we have a 32" Samsung LCD and a 42" LG LCD, however i've been told that as the viewing distance for the new TV will be quite small a plasma would be best. It will mainly be used for blu ray & gaming. Ideally 42" or 50". Any recomendations?</Content>
