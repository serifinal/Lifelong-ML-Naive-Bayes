		<Content>Hi, I'm a new member looking for advice pertaining to LCD TV for my camper van. Apparently I need a television that can use 240v or 12v. Is there anyone who can give me advice and suggest make and model I should purchase and if possible if anyone out there has what I'm looking for I can make them a reasonable offer. Many thanks</Content>
