		<Content>Narrowed down my search to either the Panasonic tx-p42gt30b or Panasonic tx-p42st30b. I was in Curry's today and they all waffle on about this price match in their adverts. Yet when I posed the question about John Lewis and Richer Sounds offering better warranty packages the saleman said they were limited warranty's they offered. Is this true for even a the 5 year warranty's they now offer? Was this basically BS? Also my other question is that basically I am wondering if the Panasonic tx-p42gt30b is worth the extra money over the tx-p42st30b? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!</Content>
