		<Content>Can I use an XGA box (gadmei) to watch freeview box on my panny 50" plasma? It only has 2 vga sockets (female) so makes a great monitor but I want to watch tv on it lol. Got it from work as it had slight IR but a great set. Tried Â£3 scart to vga cable but no joy so searched the forum and an xga box was suggested to someone but he never said how he got on with it. Cheers!</Content>
