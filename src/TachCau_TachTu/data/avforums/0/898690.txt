		<Content>Hi all, I am looking to move into an Open Plan kitchen/lounge property and just wondering, if having my beloved Plasma (Pio 5090) next to kitchen can damage its screen or inside electronics? I would rather not take risks, if you know what I mean... Any advice is appreciated. Cheers.</Content>
