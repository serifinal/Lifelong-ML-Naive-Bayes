		<Content>I have the TV in my bedroom. The viewing distance is 8 feet approx. My room has heavy drapes that block out direct sunlight onto the Plasma Screen. I am trying to work out the settings for the best PQ that I can get. I watch a mixture of Drama and Sport in general. Any advice would be most welcome as this is my first full HD TV (1080p). I live in the United Kingdom and recieve the Sky-HD service all packages sport and films. Sorry for the waffle and thanx for your answers and advice in advance.</Content>
