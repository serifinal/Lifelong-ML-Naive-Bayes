		<Content>I picked up the P50VT20B last November, and so far it's been fantastic. However, in the last week or so, the fans have gotten noticeably louder and it's not a constant sound, more a harmonic wave sound which makes it more noticeable still! Just wanted to check if anyone else has come across this before I call Costco Concierge services to get them to come have a look!</Content>
