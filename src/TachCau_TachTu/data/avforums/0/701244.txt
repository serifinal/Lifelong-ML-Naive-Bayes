		<Content>They came up on a Google shopping search and appear to offer suspiciously low pricing. However, they claim to have a shop (in Birmingham) and speaking to them, they sounded very plausible. They also claim to be Panasonic approved dealers. Any stories - good or bad? Considering a Panny 42G30 for £449 + £79 5yr extended warranty. I suppose one way to find out would be to see if John Lewis would price match!</Content>
