		<Content>Hi all, I am new to this forum and this is my first post. I finally late last year got my home theater system ready. I got the loudspeakers I want. However now I have encountered problem with my 3 year old TV. I have Samsung plasma TV (42"). Occasionally but several times every day, the screen has started to go black except one horizontal colour line (maybe 4 millileter high) somewhere in the screen. Does anyone happen to know and help me with this i.e. what could cause this ? br, MTT</Content>
