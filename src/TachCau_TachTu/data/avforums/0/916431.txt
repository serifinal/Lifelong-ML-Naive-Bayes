		<Content>My TH42PX60B is coming up to 3 years old and has so far been very well-behaved. This week my ailing Thomson Sky+HD box was replaced with a new Amstrad; the Pana has since started to go into a regular switching on and off cycle in Freeview mode though the problem seems to resolve itself when I switch the Sky box on (from standby). It seems too much of a coincidence...any thoughts, similar experiences?</Content>
