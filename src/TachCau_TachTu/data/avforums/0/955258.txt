		<Content>Hi, I purchased a 42" ST30 set a few weeks ago for my new house which I moved into yesterday. Obviously first thing I done was setup the TV, Sky and Xbox to see how it performed as it was a big leap from my old 720p plasma back in the day. I had a LG plasma (Cant remember the model) but it was only about Â£400 quid about 4 years ago so it wasn't a amazing set. I haven't calibrated or broke in the TV yet, although changed a few settings from the defaults to make it a bit better. The HD content seems amazing even at 720p from Sky HD (Put on avatar and it looked great, although it looked a bit skippy (Looked like it was on a 50hz TV or something) when the camera was panning from left to right. Is that normal? or is it because of the Sky feed?) My major problem with it is games. I put on BF3 to have a look at the improvement and I was quite disappointed with it overall. Although the picture was great, whilst turning around in circles, the motion was very very stuttery when turning a bit fast. It looked like it didn't handle turning very well at all and it started to hurt my eyes after a while. I have been playing around with some of the settings (Although I cant get into the advanced settings for some reason, the Custom picture mode wasn't there?) and nothing seems to make it better or worse. Even changing the Picture modes from game to normal or dynamic didn't really affect it. I am a bit of a AV noob so any help sorting this out will be very much appreciated. I will be calibrating the TV after it has been broken in, but looking at the settings I cant see any of the settings that d-nice describes? Are they not available on UK sets? Thanks</Content>
