		<Content>I am not sure if this has been covered before in the Forum, but I am noticing that in certain conditions, commentators etc., seem to have a very slight black edge to the image. It is barely perceptible but once noticed, it becomes irritating. I am generally delighted with the picture, except for this issue. My question is, is this normal? If not, what can I do to eradicate it? The viewing mode is, Normal, with brightness and contrast at about 50% and CATS off. Any advice would be much appreciated. Bill</Content>
