		<Content>I have a Panasonic Viera TX-P42U30B and ever since I turned it on there has been a high pitch buzzing almost a squeal. The only time you don't hear it is when the volume is loud enough to drown it out. It is becoming the only thing I hear because it is annoying me so much. What is it?</Content>
