		<Content>Hi all, I need more help, I was originally all set for the purchase of a G10, but these things are almost impossible to find at a good price in stock at the moment, after reading a review of both the G10 and the S10 on What Hifi's website I am now in even more of a muddle, they suggest there is nearly no difference between the models, so, not so much for the Â£30 price difference, mostly stock differences do I bite the bullet and go for the S10. At the end of the day I am interested in one thing, I currently have an old 28" Phillips tube set, if I have a picture quality as good as or better, I will be a happy man, obviously if it is worse.........then well.......what a waste of a lot of money. Cheers, Rob.</Content>
