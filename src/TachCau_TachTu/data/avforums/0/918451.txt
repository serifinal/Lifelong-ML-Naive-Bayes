		<Content>I have a Panasonic plasma directly connected via 2 HDMI cables to sky hd and PS3 respectively on HDMI 1 and HDMI 2. These are also mapped on my Logitech (all in one remote). No receiver is being used. I am soon to be upgrading to a 5.1 surround system complete with AV receiver and speakers. I noticed that the receiver has 3 HDMI inputs but only one HDMI. Will the remote and TV correctly map the right HDMI port to the right source?</Content>
