		<Content>Hi, I have a Pioneer PDP 436 display. When disconnected from the Media Reciever I would expect a red and blue flashing square on the screen but I get nothing but the red and blue led's flashing near the switch. I am recieving the new Media Reciever later, but wanted to start looking at the faults now. I did buy this as faulty just so you know. Any guidance would be appreciated.</Content>
