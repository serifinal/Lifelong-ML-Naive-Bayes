		<Content>Is there any difference in the technology between these TV's apart from the 3D? I'm not interested in 3D whatsoever but I'm wondering if the ST30 is worth Â£50 more than the S30 (Amazon prices). Comparing them side by side on the Panasonic website they seem to be pretty much the same apart from the 3D aspect.</Content>
