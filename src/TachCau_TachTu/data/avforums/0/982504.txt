		<Content>Hi The buzzing noise is louder on my 55 inch VT30 compared to my 42 inch PZ800 plasma which I can only hear when I?m standing next to the PZ800 When the TV volume is low on the VT30 I can hear the buzzing noise from where I?m sitting about 10 feet away? I can also hear the buzzing noise level going up and down sometimes on the VT30? Appreciate any comments! Thanks</Content>
