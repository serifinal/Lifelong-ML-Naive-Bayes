		<Content>I have noticed today that my Samsung PS50C7000 Plasma's red power light keeps blinking. Its repeating three blinks and then a pause. The TV is working fine with nothing obvious to indicate a fault. Is this some kind of error code or is it nothing to worry about? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.</Content>
