		<Content>Any help appreciated, as title says have a Panasonic V10 42" and overnight the black levels have rocketed which is very noticeable and makes dark scenes/films hard to discern. I bought it January 2010 from Tec7 so I got a 5 year guarantee but it was the display model. Apologise if this has been asked before but is there anything I can do about it? As it's under guarantee will they replace/repair it or is it a case of having to get used to it? As I said apologise if this has been asked before and appreciate any help. Ta</Content>
