		<Content>Hi, some of the experts I can 'tell if the screen of my Panasonic TV TX-P42G30E (purchased a few days ago 14-01-2012) is defective from the attached photos? The photos were taken by placing the TV on AV1 when no signal and raising the brightness'. The screen is not 'uniform and has a large halo in the center bottom of the screen plus a well-defined vertical band. During scarrellate fast (as in football), denotes the band that bears overlapping rather annoying! You might consider the picture I linked is recommended if it is my right to replace the? If yes, how? Also does anyone know if there is a software fix for this problem? I await the answer, thanks!
