		<Content>Hi I recently bought a panny 50s20 and freeview website says I should be able to receive hd channels from april this year but I can't seem to get them. On the other digital channels my signal strength and quality are at about 8 so I think the aerial is ok. I have tried re scanning for channels but they don't appear on my channel list. Does anyone have any ideas? Am i doing anything wrong? Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you</Content>
