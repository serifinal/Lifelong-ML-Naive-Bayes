		<Content>I really hope somebody has some insight on this, basically i had my laptop connected through HD cable to my Viera, as i pressed the volume up button on the remote the TV switched to a SELF CHECK screen all black with white text, it says everything is ok. I then turned the tv of and unplugged for 5 minutes plugged this back in and it came up to auto tune sort of screen and then asked me to enter a new pin to help police and security??? no matter what button i press on the remote it goes back to this "SELF CHECK" screen with the black backround and white text. Please someone if you know anything i would be so grateful. THANKS IN ADVANCE Karl.</Content>
