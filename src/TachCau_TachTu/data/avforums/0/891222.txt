		<Content>Hi all, Just got my Panasonic GT30 and am giving it a 150 hour run in but would like to calibrate it after. I know there are a couple of good DVDs out there but I don't actually have a DVD player believe it or not! Are there any options out there like a video file that could be played off USB or a set of image slides and accompanying PDF guide to follow? Just want a non-DVD solution Thanks Russ</Content>
