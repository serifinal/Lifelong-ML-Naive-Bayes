		<Content>I can get a Panasonic TX-P42S30 Plasma from a local retailer for Â£545 including the 5 year warranty, plus they also offer a TV swap out service. Is this any better than the normal Panasonic warranty? Is the swap out service really worth while? I have a spare TV to use should any new tv fail.. Cheers.</Content>
