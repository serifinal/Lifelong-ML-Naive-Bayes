		<Content>Hi, I have just bought a pioneer pdp 507xd tv and am trying to hook up my xbox 360 via the component channel. I have managed to get the picture, but there is no sound even though i have plugged in the red and white connecters from the 360 into the sound section on the back of the tv. Any ideas please???</Content>
