		<Content>Most of the first page of this Plasma forum is taken up with owners threads. I'm definitely not having a go but isn't it time AVForums had its own Owners Thread Board for each category? I think it'd free up a lot of space for more general questions on here. Just a thought, dont shoot me down!</Content>
