		<Content>Currently using a 37 inch pd60 thats 6 years old and has been used for 30k hours. I've never had a problem with it but i'm thinking of moving this to the bedroom or sell it. I can get a Panasonic TXP42VT20 for Â£600 with five year warranty, is it a no brainer or should i give it a miss?</Content>
