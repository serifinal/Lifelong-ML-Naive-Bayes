		<Content>Hi All, Has anyone heard about Pioneer's flat panel speakers? They are listed on Pioneer's uk website and I have seen it for sale at one place on the internet. However, I have not been able to get any other information on them. If anyone knows anything, or has had an opportunity to listen to them, I would like to know what your thoughts are. Edit: link to product http://www.pioneer.co.uk/uk/products...X70/index.html Thanks, R</Content>
