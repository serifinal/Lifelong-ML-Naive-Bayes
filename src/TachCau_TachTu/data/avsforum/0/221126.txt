		<Content>Video content, including all video played through Windows Media Player and YouTube via Internet Explorer or FireFox, yield horizontal scan lines during playback. The lines appear for a fraction of a second during fast panning, action, or abrupt scene changes. The problem is extremely noticeable when trying to watch a movie and is very distracting. When viewing a video in a window, the scan lines are contained in the video frame and do not affect the rest of the screen. I have tried many different screens including multiple monitors via DVI and a HDTV home theater projector via HDMI. I cannot take a screen shot of the problem, the screen shot displays perfectly. Instead I took the above photo with my digital camera, notice the line in the top half of the picture. Can this be fixed or is it a problem with my video card? I have gone through all the settings in Catalyst Control Center including pulldown detection and anti-aliasing with no success. The problem has been prevalent since the purchase of the card and has continued through multiple driver updates (currently I am running Catalyst version 8.8). The problem seems to be worst in Flash videos, MKV, and Xvid files. I have tried (2) different codec packs with the same result with both. Here is some relevant information: OS: Windows Vista Ultimate x64 Video Card: MSI Radeon HD 3870 512MB PCI-e Driver Version: Catalyst 8.8 Memory: 4GB Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad Core q9300 @ 2.5ghz Video Players Used: Windows Media Player 11, Media Player Classic, Flash Plugin for Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 2, and Firefox 3</Content>
