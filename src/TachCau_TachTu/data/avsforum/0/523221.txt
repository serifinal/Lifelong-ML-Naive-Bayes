		<Content>So what's next? Two classic war movies, a recent Oscar Best picture nominee and modern Sci-fi classic. All neutered from what should have been a major upgrade worthy of the phrase " . . . the Ultimate High Definition Experience" (sic). Well most high definition titles are worthy. But excessive manipulation of the picture to cater and satisfy them make this all worthless. Why for the love of Allah you ******* ** ***** hide the details that's otherwise present in the movie on a 1080p format? WHY?!? Its true that a majority of HD release are a substantial upgrade over the SD DVD but that is not an excuse if you make it look the movie is inhabited by wax mannequins with halos or "force fields" all throughout. Just like the CGI animation I see from the video game I play. Clean and smooth. I don't think I need to tell how disappointed I am when reports start trickling in about the excessive DNR used. Ok, fine maybe its not too bad. Then screenshots from DVDbeaver went online and right away I see the movie is "Pattonized". For two weeks people asserted that the "screenshots can't be trusted" or "screenshots doesn't not represent the PQ of the movie" or "No waiii dat pixie is photochopped to make it look worse!". Well to those people watching this movie right now (assuming your viewing set is calibrated ) what do you see? Does it match? or your TV has some magical powers to add fine detail to all HD releases. You did not have your sharpness setting set to 10 did you? Ok back to this piece of . . . err I mean Blu-ray disc. There are two versions , The Director's Cut and the Theatrical Cut. And YES there is a difference in overall PQ. But I will deal with that later in the thread There is no seamless branching. The disc is structured just like the Golden Compass and I Am Legend. As far as the DTS-HD MA sound, its excellent. Outstanding. As usual. I am not alone with what some called a "crusade" against DNR and EE. Let me correct you with that, WE have a "crusade" against Excessive DNR and EE. Even after all the arguments against these manipulations on films there are still some that just don't understand what is the big deal. It is better than DVD so what is the frakking problem? Let me show you: 'nuff said? Need to see more?
