		<Content>We have a Channel Master CM3671 and CM7778 set up on our property near Clare Michigan to get the football games etc. when we're up there camping. We have a 19" HDTV and an old Voom satellite box that we use as a digital tuner. It all runs on a generator as there is no electricity, plumbing, buildings, anything. We do have the basics though... food, shelter, TV. This was all put together on the cheap as it gets used on a limited basis. We've lived with mostly analog for a few of the big networks but that needs to change or we have to find an alternative. The cost of the solution has to be considerably cheaper than the backup plan which is to buy a satellite dish/box and pay for service a couple months out of the year. We're very close to getting the major networks out of Flint. Which is about 55 miles to the south east. We can watch ABC in full HD glory but the signal drops out so much that it's actually better to watch it in analog. I think our problems are twofold. First, the antenna is only about 8' above the ground. We've attached a 10' piece of 1 1/2" conduit to a post that was already there. It's very stable but not very tall. Second, there is a stand of at least 40' pine trees 75' to the west. It's about 100' wide and about a 1/4 mile long, running north-south. It's essentially a wall of trees. From what I've been reading, I'm thinking there might be some multi-path interference from the trees. I'm planning on being up there next weekend with the intention of doing something about the antenna. I can move it about 75' to the east to get it further away from the trees or I can come up with some way to raise the antenna up another 10'. What's going to give me the best chance at bagging those stations? What's going to do me the most good?</Content>
