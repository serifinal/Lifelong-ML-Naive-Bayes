		<Content>Well, after much anticipation, I finally managed to get my theater under way. While I still dont know "exactly" what I will have in the end, I at least have a good idea, and sometimes that's all that one needs. I want a theater room in which I can enjoy my NHL Center Ice all winter long, and partially into summer, as well as movies (blu-ray now), and then another room where we can sit and play cards and what ever else. To get things started, the lady and I just moved into a newer (16 yo.) colonial, and the biggest gripe I have is the stairs right in the middle of the basement. It limited me a bit, but in the end I will end up with 2 rooms. One 20x15 (theater) and another 11x20 (card area/fridge). the rooms are split by support beams in the middle. My construction ability is none, so I originally thought to just contract out the framing, electrical and drywall, and do the low voltage myself. Well, after months of reading, I convinced myself that I might be able to do this myself. So the decision came, whats the easiest way for me to do this? and I ended up deciding to go with steel instead of wood. I figure it is easier for me by myself to work with the steel and I can order it all at once, and not have to worry about anything warping if it lays around too long. So, on good friday my shipment came, and I hauled everything down to the basement, and that was it, the rest of the weekend was shot. I had a busy week last week, so I was not able to start until this past Saturday. Both nervous and confused, I tried figuring out what I was about to do, and as soon as I hit the power hammer for the first time I was into it. --I guess I lied, I actually started Thursday night last week because I just had to try the power hammer, I nailed down 2 runners and called it quits... Well, after the weekend, I look back and say I managed a bit more than I would have thought, but i have something now and i will take it from there. As I go along, I have no idea what kind of pace I will have, but from the looks and sounds of it from reading, many folks move fairly slow. It will be tough in the summer to get lots done, but I will do what I can and call it a day... Some before shots: The Layout...(I hate drawing)</Content>
