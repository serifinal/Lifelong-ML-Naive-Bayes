		<Content>Is there any rule of thumb to knowing what fabrics will work well for absorbing rather than reflecting sound that can be used to cover fiberglass? Or is GOM or other 100% AT fabrics the only type that won't decrease the effectiveness of the fiberglass? I've brought just over a thousand square feet of 2" OC703 and need to cover it, so we're talking about a large amount of fabric. I also just started noticing comments about formaldehyde and am worried about health issues now considering the type of room my HT is in. Are there any types of fabrics that I can completely wrap the fiberglass in that will trap some/any formaldehyde toxins but still not reflect sound? I've been looking at tricot nylon which is cheap and has a tight weave but stretches (think spandex) that I think would seal up fairly well but it's worthless if it reflects sound since I've just made a huge investment in this fiberglass. People also talk a lot about muslin but no one has said if muslin reflects too much and makes the fiberglass pointless. And of course there is GOM or celtic which is AT but then we're talking about a LOT of money for the fabric. For my HT, all 4 walls, floor and ceiling are 8"+ thick cement (16'x22'x9') which is why I bought so much insulation. The plan is to put 1" fiberglass on the front wall (AT Screen/false wall), 6" on back wall, 4" on the ceiling (ceiling is coffered with 8" wide mdf/crown "beams" and 4'x4' areas of fiberglass), and 1" on the lower 4' of the side walls. I will also have 34" face super chunk bass traps for the front corners. I'm not sure if in my environment I am fine with a more reflective fabric? My theory is bass is going to be an issue more than mids and highs, so what should I do?</Content>
