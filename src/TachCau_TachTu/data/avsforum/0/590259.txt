Oops). Can someone pm me the commandment's I never got my full copy. To save time (read as to lazy to type it all over again) I am copying what I stated over at the "motivation" thread about my build, if you already read carry on below the blue: "The details, I started my build in Jan. 07 thus far I have completed the following: Framing, I am not using staggered stud or rsic clips etc....just standard framing. When I purchased my home the framing for 3 of the exterior walls in the basement had already been framed and insulated. So I had to frame up the theater wall, mechanical room wall the last remaining exterior wall which is side facing the garage. I also framed a half wall and door underneath the steps coming down for equipment and a seperate closet for electrical panel and water meter. During this process we had some heavy rains in Spring, this led to the discovery of cracks in the foundation wall in two sepeate areas. My builder being none reponsive had to be taken to small claims for recoup of the repair costs. Electrical, ran all the wiring, receptacles, lighting fixtures. My room width is eleven and half feet so I'm not doing sconces. I have 8 recessed 4"cans. HVAC a friend helped me complete this, last summer-fall. Seperate Cooling unit, additional heating zone on boiler for forced hot air. Sheetrock in theater room done. Single layer 1/2" densarmor. No double drywall, green glue or the like. Pleasantly when I had the Supebowl party in a still under construction setup with about 20 people in the room and sound blasting, another guest came and said if she didn't know I was completing the basement she would have never known we were down cause is was so quiet. Riser done, then re-did to raise an additional 3.5 inches. Stage done loaded with sand. Both stage and riser decoupled. Dricore in HT room done. Walls primed ceiling painted. I wanted to prime the walls incase I didn't do fabric panels and simply to seal the walls. Primed with grey tinted Kilz2 actually looks pretty good as a color. I have since obtained Dazian cloth (thanks Dave) and have to fomulate some wall panels. I'm doing 4x6 star panel inside of the 8 recessed can area. Panel is done, ceiling frame is done. Need to install and surround with crown and trim. The rest of the basement is an open area in the process of being sheetrocked. Need to finish: Sheetrock-Mud & Tape Prime and paint this same area Dricore the rest of the basement Install doors on mechanical room, equipment closet, electrical closet Finish pocket door (yes I said pocket door, look at what I would name build thread for reference!!) and surround for home theater room which is located at the front of the theater room. I am doing everything I can to help insulate the hollow cavity. Install cabinets for kichenette area and perhaps a concession/bar counter. Install engineered laminate flooring outside of HT and carpeting inside of theather and stairs coming down. Install drop celing in rec room and gym area(theater room has sheetrock) along with recessed lighting trim and in ceiling speakers. Setup pool table, and wall mountd LCD. Finish projector shelf/soffit enclosure and setting up equipment False wall, cloth frames, screen frame " End of quoting thyself.. I'm gonna post some pics of some of my initial troubles and progress. Soon to follow pics of where im at now. This Loganator stuff really works</Content>
