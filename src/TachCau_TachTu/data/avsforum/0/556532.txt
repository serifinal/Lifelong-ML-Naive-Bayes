		<Content>I have a Toshiba 52HM84, I bought used. Of course it doesn't work. The seller did test the bulb in another 52HM84 and it works. When I turn it on, the TV powers on, have audio for about 10-15secs, then pwrs off. Then it cycles about 10 times, I can hear the color wheel spin up each time. And there are a series of clicks coming from what sounds like the tuner board, and eventually halts. The Red LED stays on, Green flashes. According to the service manual it says a lamp failure or light engine. I've also been reading that a faulty balast can cause this. Seems the common price is about $100 for this part. I've searched the web, and found what seems to be two different ballast. 23122468 is listed for my TV model, but I've read on other forums that someone has used a 23122468P in the same model. Can anyone tell me the differenced between these two balast's? 23122468 vs. 23122468P I've found them listed at Ecompassparts, but they don't describe the compatible models. I also have found both at TigerDirect. But this is where I'm confused, according to TigerDirect, the 23122468 is a direct replacement for 23122468P and vice versa. If you click on the actual product link 23122468 works for 46HM84, 46HM94, 46HM94P, 52HM84, 52HMX84, 52HM94, 52HMX94, 62HM14, 62HM15, 62HM84, 62HMX84, 62HM94, 62HMX94, BUT 23122468P works for only two models listed, 46HM84 & 62HM94 Can anyone tell me, are these the same two parts? One's just refurbished and the other is factory new? Only reason I'm so concerned is I'm flat broke most of the time, and one is half the price. Thanks Edit: I just found out the difference. There is none. Apparently 23122468 is a Toshiba factory part, I guess made during that DLP model's production run. And the 23122468P is a direct replacement, made after the DLP model is discontinued, contracted by another company, but stamped with a Toshiba logo. So all in all, same part, two different manufactuers, two different prices.</Content>
