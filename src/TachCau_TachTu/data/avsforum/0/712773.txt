		<Content>I'm total noob and I dunno how to use it could someone write an easier guide to using it then what is on the website I don't know what compiling is and I also don't know how to do it the websites explanation is way hard (to me)! And I cant' find any videos of people using it. Just videos of people downloading San Andreas come up every time I search for it. If someone could help I would really love a reply. Thanks for reading anyway.</Content>
