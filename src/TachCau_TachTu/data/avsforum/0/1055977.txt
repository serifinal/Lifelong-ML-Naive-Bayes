		<Content>A lot of people are looking but no one is commenting..... Both camcorders are the same price on Amazon as of today (7-17-08) and I have been reading myself to death over the past 2 weeks. I know that there are pros and cons to both models but looking for direction. The main reason we are looking to buy a new camera is that we have twin boys that are starting to get vocal and roll around. All the good stuff is about to start and I want to capture it in HD and put it up on my new Panasonic 50PZ80U the forum helped me pick out. I assume for now we will be mostly inside so that is the biggest concern as well as clear audio quality. From what I have read the HG-10 is: Hard drive but has moving parts and some potential noise Poor audio quality due to mic on top of cam somewhat clunky silver the HF100 is: slightly smaller better audio quality can capture video in 24P & 30P have to buy an additional SD card black Looking for help from owners or other potential buyers in the same situation. Any direction would be greatly appreciated...</Content>
