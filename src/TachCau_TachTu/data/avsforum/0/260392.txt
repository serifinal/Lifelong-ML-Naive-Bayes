		<Content>I've been spending the better part of the last year looking at everyone else's amazing theaters on here, so now that I've finally (mostly) completed my first one, I thought I'd share it. Moved into our new home about a month and a half ago and having a potential theater room was a must. However, we weren't in the price range to get something fairly new with a basement so I had to turn my attention to lofts and bonus rooms. Ended up settling on this house which has a great mostly closed off 21'x16' 2nd floor extra family room if you will. Things really worked out perfectly for an already constructed room to allow me to make a decent theater without wires all over the place and give it a look like it was built this way in the first place. Updated equipment list (pics need updated for speakers): Equipment Mitsubishi HC1500 Projector 100" Elite EZFrame Cinewhite Screen 2 Polk Monitor 60 fronts and CS2 center 4 Polk M3 II's surrounds Premier Acoustic PA-120 12" Sub JVC RX-412B HDMI receiver 40Gb PS3 Toshiba A3 HD-DVD Xbox 360 Nintendo Wii Grand Total = ~$4000 (that includes everything - custom bar, stools, recessed lighting, wiring, mount, etc). Not too bad considering the end result. Speaking of which, here's some pics. Sorry in advance if the pics are a little blurry, the wife's camera isn't so great. Here's the only "before" shot I have. Just a plain jane empty white room. AFTER: Coming up the stairs (theater on left) Looking into room from doorway opening Shots from each corner (flash is on) From front corner Screen area PJ Audio Pier and Equipment DVD, Blu-Ray, HDDVD collection and super cool Buckeyes LED frame (oh no, here come the haters)</Content>
