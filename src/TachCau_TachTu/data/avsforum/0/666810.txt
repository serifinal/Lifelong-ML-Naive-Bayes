		<Content>What is the best way to hook up my Blu-Ray player to my network? I have a wireless network set up on the ground floor of my house, but my home theatre is in my basement. I see a lot of people using the Powerline Ethernet adapters through their electrical outlets. Can I use a USB wireless adapter in my player? I ask all of this because I want to use the Netflix streaming option through the Samsung 2550. Any help is appreciated.</Content>
