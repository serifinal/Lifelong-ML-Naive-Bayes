		<Content>Hi, I'm using a Philips SRM7500 RF remote with Vista Media Center, and I just installed Arcsoft TotalMedia Theater in order to be able to watch HDDVD/Bluray. The problem is, when I start Arcsoft from inside VMC, the buttons on the remote don't work. I know is most likely as issue with the Philips remote software that is very Mediacenter specific, but I was wondering is anyone uses this remote and has this working before i waste alot of time on trying to get this working. Thanks in advance.</Content>
