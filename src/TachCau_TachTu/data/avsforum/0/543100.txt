		<Content><EDIT> Renamed my thread. It was too boring before, and everyone loves Jell-o!</EDIT> Hi all. About two years ago, I finished the basement in the house that I had in Anchorage, Alaska. Since then the fam and I have moved to the Denver area, and the house we bought had a clean slate, 1900sf basement below the ranch-style house that we bought. In early April, I began construction on the basement. Plans were to have two large bedrooms (14x24) for the daughters, a 'kids' TV area, exercise area, monster bathroom for the princesses, and a dedicated (this time) theater space. Disney channel will be officially blocked from this space! What follows is the progress to date. If you have pointers for the theater, I am all ears. Some random shots... Here's how I had to hide the lazy plumber's who ran all the piping UNDER the joists. Bedrooms at through the doorway straight ahead, and to the right of said doorway. Don't squeeze the Charmin, eh. Cheap/Slave labor. Aka, my father, a master carpenter who could teach Norm A. a thing or two One of the bedrooms to illustrate just why I love metal stud construction: straight walls Me, after a full day of installing hat channel in the theater Your first look at the theater's space, thru the doorway on the left... stacks of drywall (170sheets) fill the theater's 11x19 space Wall of the theater where the A/V cabinets and 106inch screen will go (also see diagram) There's nothing like a 22inch thick wall to separate the theater, right? Sketch of the front wall. The screen is off center of the wall because the left wall of the room (facing the screen) is where the 22inch thick wall is, but it gains 14inches in width as you near the door, which is on wall to the left of the front wall, if that makes sense. The screen IS centered with the seating, though. Basically, I have 3 rows of seating planned, with two risers that are either 4 or 6inches high each. Walls are all going to have dark red drapes. Carpet will be black. Lighting is by four 6" cans (main lighting), 2 4" cans on gimbals to light the a/v and video strorage areas, 4 sconces that the wife is picking out, and 'pew' lighting on the walls, with fiber optic on the leading edges of the risers. As far as speakers, I have a 7.1 system planned, which I moved with me from Alaska. It consists of a Boston VR-MC center, 8" Boston In-Walls (6 each) and a 15" Def Tech sub that I bought from a member here a few years back. I'm up in the air on a receiver so, open to suggestions. I don't have a huge budget for it... $500-700. Projector is Sanyo PLVZ-2000 and the screen will be an Elite EZ-Frame Acoustic Series, because the center goes behind. I'm also planning on hinging the screen on the side so you can open it and access additional storage space at the front of the room, since it'll be a 19" dead space behind the screen. That's it in a nutshell. I'm almost ready for drywall, as soon as I can get the plumber in, soon I hope. If anyone has suggestions, I'd love to hear it. I'm trying or an totally enveloping experience.</Content>
