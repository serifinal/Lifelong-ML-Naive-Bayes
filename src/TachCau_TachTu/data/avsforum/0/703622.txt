		<Title>120Hz TVs can ONLY do 5:5 pulldown to 24p, right?</Title>

		<Content>Some people say that Samsung 120Hz LCD TVs take 24p signals from new Blu-Ray players, and apply 3:2 pulldown to make it into a 60Hz signal, then multiply by 2 to get 120Hz. As opposed to performing 5:5 pulldown on the 24p signal (just repeating each frame 5 times, at 1/120th of a second each... which for LCDs means that each frame lasts for 5/120th of a second). Now, I just don't understand how a 120Hz TV could do anything but 5:5 pulldown on 24p input! '3:2 pulldown detection' is different from '3:2 pulldown'... the latter is the telecine process used to convert 24fps film to 60i DVDs. Progressive scan DVD players took the 60i on DVDs and, with '3:2 pulldown detection', locked onto the 3:2 cadence and reconstructed the progressive scan images, feeding those to an HDTV (but still at 60Hz). For those of you that think that a 120Hz TV would take 24p content and then apply 3:2 pulldown to it to get to 60Hz, then multiply by 2, what on earth makes you think that a TV even has a chip in there to do 3:2 pulldown? No TV should ever have to perform 3:2 pulldown (telecine) b/c that's what DVD manufacturers do when they take the film and convert it to video. Why would any TV ever need to convert film to video, when only recently do we even have sources (the latest Blu-Ray players) that can actually output 24p? I can't understand why any TV would even have a chip in there to convert 24Hz to 60Hz... given that no source even existed to feed TVs 24p, up till now with the newest Blu-Ray players! Which would then indicate that any 120Hz TV should, by default, do 5:5 pulldown. Which would also indicate that no 60Hz TV out there exists that can accept 24p input... I may be wrong on that one, in which case my entire argument falls apart. Rishi</Content>
