		<Content>UPDATE: Okay Okay. i know I've been slacking. I moved the site to a new server and have yet to finish uploading everything. I WILL have it done this weekend! And than I will begin filling requests. I do have a favor to ask though. We are trying to win a dream wedding. Can you please tell everyone you know to vote for us? It woudl really help us out. You can vote 5 times a day per email and voting goes from 2/18 - 2/24 and then again from 3/9 - 3/14. Vote at www.vote4love.com Thanks for your help. =) ORIGINAL:I started this new thread because the other thread was old and a lot of people kept asking the same questions. I've put together a number of theater signs in high-res for you to print on photo paper. They are free to download, you just need to register on the site and you will have access to the high resolution versions. I do take requests but my schedule is pretty busy so I may not get to it right away. Here's the site: www.tinstudio.com Enjoy!</Content>
