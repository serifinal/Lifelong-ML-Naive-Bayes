		<Content>This simple, user-friendly calculator may be helpful to anyone planning to buy a screen. The calculator lets you specify the screen size (diagonal, width, or height), the screen aspect ratio, and the frame (or border) width. The calculator then computes the viewing area dimensions, as well as the total screen height and width including the frame or border. It also lets you see at a glance the image height, width, diagonal, and area for five user-modifiable image aspect ratios when projected onto the specified screen. The calculator is provided in two versions, one for use with MS Excel (preferred) and a second for use with the less capable, but more widely distributed, MS Works Spreadsheet. Either version will also run in the spreadsheet portion of Open Office, a free download. Your comments/criticisms are invited. ETA- Thanks to member 1canuck2 for adding to the Easy Calculator to include calculating how the screen fits onto your screen wall. See post #25 below for this more comprehensive version of the calculator.</Content>
