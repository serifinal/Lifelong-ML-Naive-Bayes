		<Content>*** Scroll down for Calibration reports Time to start a stand alone owners thread for this model now that people are starting to get them in hand and installed. So if you own the 141 take some pictures and post your impressions here. Maybe the 141 vs 151 thread could be merged here, but a "vs" thread is not what I am interested in nor is it the purpose of this thread. This is a stand alone 141 owners thread. Useful Specs: 481 Watts (0.3 W Standby) 2.5" Subjected to a 100 hour break in period at the factory Mounting Holes: 33 15/16" by 19 11/16" http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/portal/site/EC/ Quote: Originally Posted by Bogney Baux Here are my Pure Cinema refresh frequency results for each setting on the PRO-141FD.

You have to calibrate all sub-levels....meaning difference input types (1080p/60, 1080p/24, 1080i, 720p, 480p, 480i, etc) While I totally recommend using ControlCal or getting a pro to calibrate your display since Pioneer does not allow you to have access to all adjustments this way, buts its still interesting to know how you can access the ISF mode via your web browser. This works on both Euro and north american units.

Bought Apple Aiport Express 2.) Connected 141 to the network (hired computer networker) 3.) Once connected I was able to access all the control menus excpet for ISF mode which requires a password. See above for how to access. 4.) Setting up the email function was a little tricky. My best guess is that what you are required to enter is in fact labled wrong. ------I did not need to put in an ID or password -----"Mail server SMTP" is actually for the Mail Server IP address -----"Sender Address" is for your email address ----- There is no DNS built into the email 5.) Once you get your IP address for the display type it into the browser. The manual suggests you should only use Internet Explorer, but I can confirm you can also use Safari.
