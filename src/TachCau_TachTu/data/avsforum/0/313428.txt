		<Content>The two towers Well, after have been a member of avsforum for quite a while it&#8217;s probably time for me to tell a little bit about my setup. I&#8217;ll start by letting you know a little bit about the room where the listening takes place, cause as we all know that&#8217;s quite an important part of the system&#8230; The listening room My listening room is a second part of a large living room in an old apartment. When we moved in I decided to renovate the living room, which among others included splitting it into two rooms. One of the rooms was dedicated as a listening room. The end result regarding the room structure is some kind of a room-in-room-solution. The room has been build by my self only, so the project kept me busy a whole summer. A new room-skeleton was first built into the existing room, where the new walls are not in contact with the existing walls. The new walls are isolated, of course, and finished with two layers of plaster boards. The original ceiling height was 3 meters, and was lowered 30 centimeters in the new room. The heavily isolated with 150 millimeter Rockwool isolation, and 150 millimeter of air Further, the ceiling also consists of two layers of plaster boards mounted on sound hoops (?). The ceiling is not in contact with the walls. The floor is &#8220;semi-floating&#8221;, which means that it first has been isolated with special noise reducing plates, floor chipboards and finished with parquet floor. The floor is not in contact with the walls. Lastly, the room has its own concealed wiring for the electrics, and built in channels the surround speakers. The equipment Regarding the front speakers, Zu Audio Presence, as far as I know I'm the only one in Norway owning a pair of these. I haven't found much info on the Presence here on avsforum either, what surprises me a bit... Speakers Front: Zu Audio Presence Center: Swans 2.3C (replace with Avantgarde Solo?)
