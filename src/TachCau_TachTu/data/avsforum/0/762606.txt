		<Content>After looking at all sorts of the options for my 2' thick cement ceiling I decided that $15sqft for mineral tiles was just too much. The other choices like celiume would cost just over $3sqft and they offer almost no acoustical help. Since my room is 16'x22'x9' and all 6 cement walls I think I've decided what is needed and wanted to make sure I'm on the right track before I make all the orders. I'm going to use 3/4" mdf strips to hold sheets of 4'x8' 1" (I think it's safe for me to rule out 2" because of the amount of fiberglass I'm using?) 3lb fiberglass board away from surfaces. The ceiling will be fully covered with fiberglass and covered by an inexpensive black fabric, this will hopefully give the feeling of a "taller" ceiling by absorbing much of the mid and high's. The side walls will have roughly 4'x4' fiberglass panels held 3/4" of an inch away from the walls, in between the 10"x17"x9' columns (the columns will be 3/4" mdf also be covered in a cloth and the middle 3' of the column will hold speakers inside in some locations). In between the columns, covering the fiberglass panels and cement walls above them will be some theater stage curtain like fabric (to be picked). I'm still debating on thick curtains to stop mid's/high's or something thin to let them pass through and bounce off the cement walls behind). The front wall (behind the false wall and AT screen) will be 1" fiberglass, like everywhere else. I'll layer it 2" thick behind the LCR speakers, behind the screen. The front to corners, floor to ceiling will have 12"x12" (17" face area) bass traps. The rear wall will again have columns and fiberglass like the side walls. The carpet will be outdoor carpet (or water safe) and probably no pad under it (due to potential water coming into the room) There will be 7"x14" MDF soffits around the room, but over the front screen is still up for debate. The soffit will not touch the ceiling or walls, but rather 'float' 2" away from both surfaces in an L shape, and will be stuffed with r-38 where not close to can lighting inside of the soffit. I plan on using spray adhesive to hold the cloth to the fiberglass. I'm hoping I can glue the cloth to the 4'x8' sheets on the ceiling, then glue the fiberglass to the 3/4" mdf strips along the ceiling, can anyone comment on this too? There are also photos in my .sig construction thread. Thanks for all your help. I've hopefully done enough research to know I'm on the right track.</Content>
