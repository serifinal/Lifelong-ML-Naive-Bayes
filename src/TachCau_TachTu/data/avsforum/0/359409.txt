		<Content>I've laid out a very rough diagram of my room in the attachment below, and an actual photo of the front of the room can be found here for ease in conceptualizing. Note - the photo was taken before I moved the sub to the other side of the room and bought a pair of B&W 683s for the fronts, the 602s were moved to the back, and the couch seen on the right is about 2-3' closer to the back of the room than it appears in the photo. A bit of room description: The three slim rectangles on the back of the room (behind the couch) are supposed to be windows. They have wooden blinds on them that are almost always down. There are pictures on the right wall and a large 2-3' high valence that runs the length of the back wall above the windows. 9' ceilings. My current (new) setup: AVR: Onkyo 805 Fronts: B&W 683 (biamped) Center: B&W HTM2 (the older one that's basically the same as the new HTM4S) Rears: B&W 602 S2 Sub: Adire audio 15" Tempest in custom 9cubic' box port-tuned to 17hz and driven by a Mackie FR1400i amp (1400x1@2ohm) Unfortunately I can't move the couch away from the wall. The 602s are currently sitting on pretty low speaker stands that they were previously on (you can see them in the photo of the room), only in the rear. So after all the background, my questions: 1. What is a good height for rear speakers to be at? I feel they might be too low now as they are relatively big "bookshelf" speakers sitting on 12" stands - the tweeter and top of the woofer is just a bit above the side cushion on my couch. 2. The B&W HTM2 I just bought will not fit in the TV stand like the LCR600 shown in the photo, so I figure I have to either put it on its own stand in front of the TV stand (ugly) or maybe wall mount the TV (on a shelf or something) and set it on the TV stand. Suggestions? 3. I have an extra couple low profile wall-hanging speakers from my upstairs setup that I'd like to mount in between the windows at the rear as the last two speakers of a 7.1 setup. This would mean they are directly behind the people seated on the couch though, and might not image properly with the rest of the setup. Is it worth doing? 4. Any other suggestions on the overall setup are welcome. I know it's a pretty suboptimal arrangement, but it was the best I could do while maintaining the functionality of a family room.</Content>
