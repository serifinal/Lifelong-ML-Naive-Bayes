		<Content>I need advice.. I have a 20x14 foot room, 10 foot ceiling that has a wedding cake design that slopes up to 13 feet. TXSr605, 3 front speakers, 1 sub, and 4 surround Anyways.. I have a couch at the back of the room.. how should i set my back surround speakers (the 2 speakers that are behind you)? Should I put them on the back edge of the ceiling and have them point straight down? Advice would be great! Also, is it ok if I install non-rated inwall speaker cables in an attic full of insulation? I have MonsterXP 50 feet speaker cables for my surround. Thanks!</Content>
