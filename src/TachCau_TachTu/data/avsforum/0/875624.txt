		<Content>Well after waiting almost two years for my new home, I'm FINALLY IN!!!! I've been reading and posting here for almost two years to the day, and after filling my tiny apartment with A/V components over the past two years, the day has finally come to move my toys to a dedicated "Man-Cave"...in a REAL house. ...a little background My humble beginnings here at AVS, Sept 2006, 1 Bedroom 500 sq.ft. apartment. a 10 year old 27" Mitsubishi CRT TV,Yamaha 5.1 pro logic surround sound w/Yamaha 8" powered sub older Mission bookshelf speakers and a Yamaha progressive scan SD DVD player. My first HDTV purchase Sept. 08/2006 Pioneer PDP-5070HD , Motorola HD STB (DCT-6200) ...then things started snow-balling (ohoh, hang on tight!) Followed shortly by an XBOX 360 w/HD DVD drive, PS3, Yamaha RX-V661 for HDMI and 7.1 audio Then in the Spring 07' I added some better Tower speakers (Mission) and a real sub (Velodyne) I ditched the XBOX HD-DVD add-on in favour of a Toshiba HD-A2 HD DVD player for Lossless Audio and better upconversion Picked up a second Pioneer plasma (PDP-5080HD) Kuro in the Spring of 08',so I could move the 5070 to the Master Bedroom. Another AVR upgrade (RX-V1800), found a second matching 12" Velodyne sub on sale, Half Price! and added another Motorola HD DVR (DCT-3416) My ex-bachelor pad just a couple weeks before moving day to the new home Current Component list: Video Epson PowerLite Home Cinema 1080UB (Ultra Black) Projector *new* 120" Powered Richvision 1.3 Gain Screen w/ wireless remote *new* Pioneer Kuro PDP-5080HD Plasma Motorola HD DVR (DCT 3416) Toshiba HD-A2 HD DVD PS3 60Gig (fried HDMI port) PS3 80Gig *new* XBOX Pro 360 (RROD) XBOX 360 Elite *new* Audio Yamaha RX-V3900 *new* 9.2 speaker configuration (7.2 + 2 Front Presence) Mission Speakers M31i Front Presence M34i L/R Towers M32i Center M31i Surrounds M31i Back Surrounds Dual Velodyne DPS-12 Sub's Spares Yamaha RX-V1800 Pioneer PDP5070-HD (Master Bedroom T.V.) Samsung 26" LCD (Kitchen T.V.) Motorola DCT 6200 HD STB (Master Bedroom) Yamaha RX-V661 AVR Yamaha 8" Powered Sub and a bunch of Mission M30 speakers Pioneer and Yamaha DVD players My New Home New Built, Two Storey Victorian with un-finished basement 3 Bedroom, 2.5 Bath and about 700 sq.ft. per level a former Show Home, it came fully landscaped,decorated,furnished and with all stainless steel appliances The plan for the basement man-cave is to start with my 50" plasma and eventually set up for a Projector/Screen (96"-120") Now for the Fun stuff: using Google SketchUp Back to reality...here's where I'm at now Finished stairwell leading down to the future HT . . . Dedicated Theater area 14'-5"W x 16'-9"D x 7'-9"H = aprox 250 sq.ft./1900 cubic feet I cant afford to Totally finish the space right away, so this is going to be a long drawn out work-in-progress, and to make things even more difficult, I will need to work around all my gear after the room is full of furniture and AV equipment. Not ideal I know, but its either that or leave everything in storage for another year or two...THAT just aint Happenin' My First Home Theater ...My Kuro plasma just wasn't enough, so I made my home movie Experience Larger than Life with a Projector!</Content>
