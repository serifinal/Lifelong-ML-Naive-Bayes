		<Content>**Last Updated: May 21, 2008** If you are looking for information on anything regarding the new line of Samsung LNxxA750 LCD TVs you've come to the right place. This first post will be regularly updated and contain a summary of information regarding these TVs. So, if you want to know what's happening in this thread, check this post first. ***This post is a work in progress. If you think anything should be added to this post let me know and I'll get right on it.*** Differences between the LNxxA650 and LNxxA750:750 has an integrated woofer 16-bit processor vs. 12-bit in 650 (10-bit panel in both) 750 has DLNA features (can stream audio/video/etc. over a home network) 750 can play video off of DLNA/USB flash drive. 650 limited to images/audio 750 comes with 1GB internal flash memory pre-loaded with HD pictures, games, recipes, and a few other things 750's controls on the bezel have a red backlight. 650's controls have no backlight 750 has a square bezel compared to the 650's rounded bezel 750 has a square stand compared to the 650's oval stand 750 stand does not swivel (contrary to Samsung's literature) ************750 Calibration/Settings Thread Link*************** Calibration/Settings Thread ****************************************************** Known Issues:The 'Halo' Effect: Some people have noticed that the clear surrounding of the 750 bezel acts as a sort of fiber optic transfer for the screen. What this means, is that at certain angles, and in certain darker lighting conditions, the bezel will dimly light up with the colors that are on the screen. This appears somewhat like a 'halo' encircling the TV. Some people find this hugely distracting, others couldn't care less. It's up to you to see it and decide for yourself. This is a purely aesthetic effect as the result of the bezel design and has nothing to do with the electronic hardware. Here's an example of the effect. Better pictures will be posted as they become available. Notice the glow on the top of the bezel. As said previously the presence of the effect is very dependant on lighting condition and viewing angle.

What this means is that the 750 series TV's are able to display streaming content from a computer. First you must connect the TV to your network. Then you must install the included Samsung software on your PC and you should be good to go. This does not work with the wireless adapter (sold separately). The DLNA network must be connected via a normal broadband networking cable. (i.e. CAT-5) People have reported that the free software TVersity (www.tversity.com) will also work with the TV and may be somewhat more user friendly. Here are the currently supported file types that the 750 can display: (More types may be supported. Samsung has stated they're updating the user manual to reflect all supported file types) Image: JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg) Audio: MP3 (.mp3) Video: (Resolutions are the maximum resolution that file type can be displayed) Wiselink PRO Explanation: Wiselink PRO is the TV's ability to play media stored on a USB flash drive. To use this feature, simply place the drive in the Wiselink USB port located on the side connections panel and then navigate the appropriate menus. All of the same file types from DLNA are supported over Wiselink PRO. USB harddrives such as an external hdd or an iPod are not supported. Attach these at your own risk as owners of other models of Samsung TVs have reported that trying to access files on these resulted in bricking the TV. ***Note: The NTFS formatting system is not supported. The drive must be formatted in FAT32.*** LNxxA750 Block Diagram: Taken from the service manual</Content>
