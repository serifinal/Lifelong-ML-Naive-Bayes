		<Content>I am unable to view these TV's in person so I'm looking for opinions from people that have seen these displays. The only thing I really care about is which of these has the best PQ? The LG appears to have a better contrast ratio and more input & display resolutions but I assume the specs on plasmas are exaggerated like other displays. The LG has a 30 Bit XD Engine video processor and an optical input where as the Samsung has a DNiE+ video processor and a headphone jack. Which one people...please and thanks.
