		<Content>These are available now. Samsung Series 5 LCD (2008) HDTVs Model Numbers: * LN32A550P - 32-Inch * LN37A550P - 37-Inch * LN40A550P - 40-Inch * LN46A550P - 46-Inch * LN52A550P - 52-Inch (The above links go to Samsung's support pages which includes manuals and quick start guides for each). Something I would like to point out is that the 32" and 37" models have worse technical specs than the 40", 46", and 52". A 15,000:1 contrast ratio compared to a 30,000:1 contrast ratio (and possibly other differences). So even though they are in the same 550 series they are not all the same!
