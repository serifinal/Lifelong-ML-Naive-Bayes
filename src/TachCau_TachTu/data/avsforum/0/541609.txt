		<Content>Welcome to the CG Family Theater construction thread! I thought I'd go ahead and post some other work we're doing on this new theater to give everyone an opportunity to see how this theater is coming along. Some background on this build. My neighbor was having his basement finished by the builder who did his house and was starting in less than a week. The builder had some ideas for the space, but the neighbor (I'll call him CG) wanted to ensure the room performed and just didn't look pretty. A friend of CG's told him to go do some research on AVS and he stumbled across my thread. As he looking at the name and some of the photos, he realized we were neighbors and lived one street over, although we didn't know each other. He then registered with AVS and PMed me to see if he could check out the theater and get some insight since his builders were starting in a few days. The night he came over we spent about 4 hours talking about construction, equipment and viewing demos. He had already spoke to one theater builder who was too expensive. I told him that Jason (jikkjack) and I would be happy to work with him and his builder to help build out the room. He was scheduled to speak to another audio/video installer that Saturday and I armed him with a bunch of questions to ask him to see what he knew. I guess this thread wouldn't be in the works if it had gone in that direction. About the unfinished room. The room itself is already pretty isolated because it is directly underneath a single car garage. The rough dimensions are about 12.5' x 23' x 12'. All four walls are poured concrete with an opening for a double door (now framed for a 4' double door). The ceiling has steel I-beams and metal to hold the concrete poured for the garage slab. There are only two other openings besides the door, each being about 12"x18" located near the ceiling for ductwork/wires to go through. From a concrete room to a finished theater. What CG wanted was a room that would look great and perform. Acoustic treatments were a must, isolation was not critical due to the location and the characteristics of the room. He wanted a more contemporary look and didn't want to lose a lot of width putting in large columns. He wanted to hide the speakers, have a stage and a riser (builder wanted to put in a double riser for a third row). Seating would likely be a combination of a sofa and theater loungers. He wanted a rack, but wasn't sure where it would go. He had no preferences on equipment, but sure liked how my room sounded. He wanted all the remotes integrated into a universal remote with light control. He'd likely go with something like a Panny AX200 and possibly upgrade at some point later. Next steps. After seeing the room and discussing options with the neighbor, the first thing I did was put together some conceptual construction and electrical drawings for discussion points for the builder and project manager to go through. I wanted to make sure they started out on the right foot. I would go through the drawings that Monday they would start construction. Pictures coming up shortly! Bud</Content>
