		<Content>I swear this drives me insane... Why do you always see FP TVs mounted 5-7ft in the air? I can't tell you how many people put them above fireplaces or just high on the wall.. What is it, 50% or more of LCD and Plasma owners? Who wants to stare up at a TV like a security monitor?</Content>
