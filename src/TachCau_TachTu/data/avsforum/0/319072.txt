		<Content>My HTPC has let me down getting a signal from the HTPC to my Onkyo receiver, so my last resort is a VGA-S-Video cable (not ideal, i know!). However, the cable im contemplating states "Your VGA card must support TV out directly through VGA port function". but I dont know my the motherboard I am using (ASUS P5QL-CM) support this. Does anyone know if it does, or how i tell? Thanks</Content>
