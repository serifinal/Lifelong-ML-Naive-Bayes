The room was already wired with monster speaker cable and I will only be here 1 year. my budget was $600 otd for reciever, speakers and sub. So far I have the following: onkyo sr606 (factory reman) $284 otd polk rm10 sats and center (factory reman) $178 otd this leaves me with $140 for the sub Currently looking at the following subs: Dayton SUB100 for about $150 Velodyne-VX10 for about $170 BIC Venturi for about $150 Phoenix Gold PSW-10 for about $130 Please let me know your thoughts or any other suggestions. First system set up here so your help is much appreciated.</Content>
