		<Content>Goals: - as big as reasonably possible while looking good - able to be bright enough to watch TV (eg Superbowl) or kids animated BR/DVDs with some lights on - (I realize these are competing goals) - Get a screen (if possible) installed by the Superbowl (family coming over) Room: Link to my HT thread at AVS -- Dedicated HT room - designed by Rives Audio -- Dimensions: 22ft 4in x 17ft 6in x 7?7? height (ceiling diffusers hang 2.5-3? down) -- Seating (planned) for 8 = 4 in front, 4 in back on a ~6? riser -- Approximate screen-to-seat distance: - Front row: ~11 ft - Back row: ~16 ft -- Bass traps, ceiling diffusers, and acoustic treatments throughout room -- Room wall and ceiling color: Sherwin-Williams ?Warm Stone? Rack: Middle Atlantic WR-37-32 Power: dedicated 20A lines & house surge protection - Electronics: Surge-X SEQ - Projector: Furman M1500-UPS-PFP - Mains/sub: Panamax M2A20 Projector (ceiling mounted): JVC RS20 (pre-ordered @ AVS) / Temporary: Toshiba 42XV540U Regza 1080p LCD 120Hz Screen: ? 2.35:1 ? brand, type, gain, size ? Cable: SA8300HD Receiver: Denon 5308CI DVD: Oppo DV-980H Blu Ray:Samsung BD-P1500 (profile 2.0) (future: Oppo BDP83) Mains: Rocket Onix RS1000 Signature Center: Rocket Onix RSC200 Signature Side surrounds: Rocket Onix RSS300 dipole Rear surrounds: Rocket RS250 MkII Subwoofer: SVS PB12-Ultra/2 (rosewood) Ethernet switch: D-Link DES-1024D 24-Port 10/100 Rack Mount Game: Xbox with planned Xbox 360 (Jasper) in the future Remote: ?? (considering Control 4 for lighting and HVAC control) Researching: screen, HT seating, remote, DVR expander HD (WD 1TB coming soon?) Pending: JVC RS20 projector I have been reading the 2.35:1 CIH threads and screen threads ? especially the High gain thread as well as the RS20 Screen thread. I also was looking at the DaLite "JKP Affinity" HD Progressive and Enhanced Matte White screen thread, but that doesn?t sound like what I need. I think a higher gain screen might be helpful. Screens I have thought of: - DaLite "JKP Affinity" HD Progressive and Enhanced Matte White screen (gain 0.9 ?) - sounds like it won't work - Da-Lite High Power (HP) (gain 2.8) +/- Pro Image horizontal masker (http://www.dalite.com/dalitehomethea...?product_id=15) - other AVS quote "I have mine on ceiling, even tought i wont have the full 2.8gain, and i don't need it. What sold me to it is screen texture. the HP have virtually no screen texture. I tried a LOT of screen sample on my wall the the HP is the only one that wouldn't drive me crazy" "the narrow viewing cone issue even seems to be over-stated. i think most will be pleased. my image seems bright and vivid to the point that i've been asked several times if there is big "tv" built in behind the screen. no one has ever mentioned a perceived change in the image as they move around or sat or stood." REC eye level mount (vs ceiling) - but ok with ceiling too (BW supposedly better for ceiling) - Stewart Studiotek (gain 1.3), others? - Carada Brilliant White (BW) (gain 1.4) - AVS quote "If you're ceiling mounted, I'd 100% get the Carada BW." - Vutec Silver Screen What about (horizontal) masking systems for these screens ? likely to add on later? Please feel free to comment. I realize ?huge? and ?bright?/detailed/etc are somewhat competing features to optimize. My JVC RS20 should arrive on Friday and be installed next Wed, so I should be able to play around with it some (on the wall) to get an idea of screen sizes, brightness, etc. Thanks. Mike</Content>
