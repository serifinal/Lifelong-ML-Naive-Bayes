		<Content>Hello, Probably a basic question for all web gurus. Which site has the biggest range of music in lossless format. Is it still itunes or has someone else taken the number 1 spot? If its still itunes is much of their collection now available in ALAC/lossless? If I download songs in ALAC format do I need to worry about DRM when ripping CDs or copying these to a backup drive etc? Thanks for any help offered. Sincerely, -dollarman</Content>
