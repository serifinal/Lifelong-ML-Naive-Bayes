		<Content>Four years ago, after my daughter was bron, I purchased a canon MiniDV camcorder afetr what I thought was due research. Although there WERE cautionary posts/reviews out there about the Canon's lack of low light performance, I bought the canon due to a considerable price difference between it and the comparable Sony. Long story short, i sold teh Canon after 2 months and purchased a Sony TRV. This time around, after using the Sony TRV MiniDV for 4 years and being overall happy with the performance, I did not even give Canon a chance and have been researching/reading posts/reviews only regarding the Sony SR-11/12 series. I have lately decided to wait till past thanksgiving to see if there are more price drops due to economy/low consumer spending etc and I now have more time to research. Professional website reviews aside, i am looking for feedback from Ex Sony camcorder users who have had a chance to try the new Canon series. I am mostly interested in low light performance differences, ease of use, editing software differences between the sony and Canon etc. Thank you all for your feedback.</Content>
