		<Content>I have a ps3 with a new usb 1tb hard drive connected... i formatted it as one large FAT32 partition, and it has a power supply from its own AC adapter. Everything works fine (usually) when I power up the ps3 and then later power up the hard drive... but if I leave the hard drive on and turn the ps3 off, it is no longer recognized when I turn the ps3 back on. Is this common or a unique issue with my hard drive or enclosure? It is really annoying given that I want to have the whole thing managed by remote and would like to just leave the drive turned on all the time. Any suggestions or solutions would be appreciated!</Content>
