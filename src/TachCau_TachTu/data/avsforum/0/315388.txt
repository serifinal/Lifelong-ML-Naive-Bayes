		<Content>Hey all. My HTPC is really getting me down. I'm using WinXP and Nero right now just to play around until i get the upcoming Asus HDMI audio card. I was having an issue where when i ran Nero Show time with DVD and Hardware acceleration on, the screen was all distorted. I fired off a message to XVX tech support and they suggested I re install my chipset drivers. I did this and it worked. Here si the problem though. The screen is clear until the movie gets past the screen that shoes the movie studio logo, then it freezes. So basically it plays for about 10 seconds. I did CTRL-ALt-Del to end it and noticed my CPU usage was at 99% so i'm guessing that it's the overloading of the CPU that caused the freeze. I restarted the computer and when it's at idle, with nothing running, just the desktop, cpu usage is at 80%! No wonder i can't even play a DVD. Unfortunately I don't know what the usage was at before I updated the drivers but I can't see that causing this issue. There are no applications running, 28 processes running in the back ground, and PCU temp is 39deg. Any idea what could be causing this? The computer I'm on right now is running 48 processes and CPU usage is at 6%. It's a P4 3.2ghz. I'm tempted to wipe the whole thing out and start over with a clean install. Thanks allot everyone.
