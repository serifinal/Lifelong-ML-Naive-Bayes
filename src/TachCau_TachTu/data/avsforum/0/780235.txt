I am now ready to build my mancave with all the good stuff like home theater, bar, and office. The problem: I have no idea how to do the 3D animations or renderings everyone posts on here. Can someone help me? I measured out the basement. The rectangle area by the stairs is to be used for the entertainment/bar The rectangle area bulging out in the middle is the be the office. I'll take pics of the basement asap</Content>
