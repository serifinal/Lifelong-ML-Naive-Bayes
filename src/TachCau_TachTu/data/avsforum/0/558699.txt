		<Content>OK, Tom would like a little help in coming up with design ideas for his challenging space. Now that the water has receded it's full speed ahead. The Room shown below is the basic space Tom is working with. 12' 3" wide. There is a Big Ass ductwork soffit taking a bite out of the right side. it is 35.5 inches wide by 11 tall. Overall ceiling height is 88 1/2. There is a bump out centered in the front that is 34 inches wide by 26 1/2 deep. The only electric panel for the house hugs the right front. Plans are for a single row of Berklines potentially moved around the room in more of a U shape for more of a lounge style seating depending on the event. There will be a bar on the right side behind the seating. Tom's speakers will be floor standing L/R that are 35.5H x9.25W x 13D, center is 7.5H x17W x 7.5D. He also has an SVS tube sub that is 40H and 16 in diameter. He has the fabric for an SMX AT screen so the natural thought is to stick the center and sub in that front niche (subject to testing the sonic impact) Usually one would think that putting a matching soffit on the left would help the design but that would make 50% of the ceiling a little less than 6 1/2 feet high. So rule that out. Here is my suggested plan 1.0 Build a soffit extension of 18 inches deep in the front and cutting across the left front corner at a 45 matching the front of the stage below. Build a stage with 2x8s and two layers of 3/4 decking for a total of 9 inches as shown: Then build some movable proscenium frames covered with black GOM. Held in place against back blocking with Velcro. Use 2 inch deep material for the framing. Maybe put the one on the right on hinges for quick access to the circuit breakers. Add some linacoustic and black material to the front wall and hang a 96 inch wide 16:9 screen. While originally Tom wanted a 2:35 screen if he did that then the resulting 16:9 image would be pretty small for sports. Projector is assumed to be 1080P although one hasn't been selected. Lastly here are some of the dimensions (rough) on a top down view showing speaker placement. OK, let's have some FEEDBACK and SUGGESTIONS for this challenging space.</Content>
