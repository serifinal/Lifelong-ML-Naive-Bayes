		<Content>I just got this TV and I can't seem to find a thread on how to properly set it up or calibrate. Is there anything I should do before I hook up it and turn it on? Or can I just start watching TV right now (btw I already have Hi-def and have had it for several years w/ my old DLP). I know the first 100 hrs are crucial for plasma TVs, is it similar for LCDs?</Content>
