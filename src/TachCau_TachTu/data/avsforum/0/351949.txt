		<Content>Hey all , been a long while since i was here. My 5084, has been working just super, except for the odd annoyance when in watching certain HD channels, theres a bit of a white line on the top, or the left side of the screen. Doesnt happen all the time,. just certain programs, Sat Nite live for example always has a white line on the top., but if its a different program, ( same channel ) there isnt a white line on top. only happens now & then. It doesnt bother me much, a few other tiny annoyances, but overall, this TV rocks! We get comments all the time how clear & sharp & natural the picture looks. HOWEVER ! Since last Tues, Shaw cable recently did a firmware upgrade to thier system. Now my justscan mode is a total mess ! I now, have this fat green line about 3/4 inch wide on the right side of my screeen. The left side of my screen has about a 3/4 inch pushover, ( kinda looks like a bevel edge on a mirror). I have talked to shaw about this & it appears nothing can be done. We tried a new box & switching cables & adjusting settings. To no avail This only happens in justscan mode. I love justscan mode, thats what i always watch the HD channels in , esp those that are putting out 1080i. Prior to this firmware update, the picture was damn perfect. now i have to watch in 16:9 mode so i dont have to see that awfull fat green line on the right. 16:9 is nowhere as sharp looking as justscan. I tried other sources, such as the PS3, & my PC, in just scan mode...... NO problem at all.... So something shaw has done in their firmware update, has done this. I dont think its my TV, as this green line & bevel only occurs with Shaw Cable. Talking again with Shaw cable today, & its not the fault of Shaw, per say, its actually Motorola, whom this firmware update came from. "Apparently"..... its only Samsung televisions that have been affected. So it seems that its basically up to Motorola to fix their firmware update & or Samsung to release a new firmware update to blend with motorola's new update. Im so sad about all of this,,,,,,,, no its not the end of the world........ but HD tv just isnt the same anymore,, snif ........ Guess im gonna have to get more Bluray movies cheers all Neo If any one else on Shaw who owns one of these TV's , has noticed a change on thier TV since last Tues, it would be great to hear from you. Have a great weekend cheers Neo</Content>
