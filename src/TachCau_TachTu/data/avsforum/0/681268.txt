		<Content>OK, we have heard it before, and I want to set the record straight. There have been alot of inquiries regarding whether Pioneer will honor their warranty to purchasers of their Kuro displays. In particular, there has been speculation as to whether they will honor an Elite product if it has been purchased from a "non authorised Elite dealer". My position is simple. Your warranty is with the manufacturer and not the seller. The law provides no exceptions to designated " authorized dealers". If you purchase a new Pioneer display they have no choice but to honor the warranty in the country it was sold, however, there are limitations. Canada remains a mystery, both for cost and warranty support. This is plausible because they cannot supply support over a region 1.87 million miles. In the US, you have statutory and case law to secure your claim. If the product is new and not resold you have warranty rights, express and implied. EDIT: The warranty specifically points out that the original buyer or subsequent purchaser has all of the warranty rights. I have never seen a post where Pioneer has denied a claim based on whether it was sold by a authorized dealer or not, so I believe this thread will not produce a valid claim. Bottom line: Pioneer makes the best Plasma out there and it involves alot of tech that is not perfect. Buy your display where you believe there is secure customer support. If you have a unresolved claim post it here, but you have to post the correspondence. We will not accept a claim based on lip service. I will attempt to work through these claims as a last resort from your seller. Paul</Content>
