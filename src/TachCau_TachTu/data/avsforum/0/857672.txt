		<Content>Hi I just purchased a Bravia kdl-46w4100 about 3 weeks ago. About a week ago I started to notice when I turn on my tv it will have this red line on the right side it's about 3 inches wide and runs from top to bottom. After a few minutes it will fade away. Can someone please tell me if I should contact Sony or is this something I can fix with a firmware update currently I have the latest update on Sony website. Thank you</Content>
