		<Content>hi folks My video equipment is top of the line 9 inch CRT projector a decent video processor! I have been feeding this set up from a desktop computer for dvd playback and some game playing! ....but sadly in the sound department i am still stuck in "2 channel ville", so i figured it is time to join the multi channel crowd! (not to mention a standalone dvd player with sdi output...which as i understand the dv-5900 is an excellent candidate for such a modification!) I have come across a decent deal on a kenwood VR-5700 sovereign series receiver! (with all the works the entree player with keyboard ,the dv-5900 400 dvd player and the receiver mentioned above) Why I wanted to stick with a kenwood was because: My graduation gift from high school was a Kenwood sound system and it is still being used in my home theater! (well at least the 2 channel amp and the eq! said goodbye to the dual cassette deck and the 5 cd changer a while back, but they are still sitting in my garage! ) That is enough on the back story! I have search the internet and this forum and all that I have been able to see is that one has more power than the other! is there any other differences between the 5700 and the 5900 that is worth mentioning? It is also my understanding that with my existing 2 channel amp i can have 7.1 ....what is the deal with that? Does this mean that the processing is there but no amplification for the rear surrounds? Could someone also explain to me if dts is all that i will need (for movies) as far as decoding is concerned with this unit , or am i missing some important options in buying this unit! the decoding capabilities are as follow: --Dolby Digital --DTS --Dolby Pro Logic II --THX Surround EX --DTS ES (matrix and discrete) --DTS Neo 6 decoding Any help will be appreciated and let me thank you all in advance for any advice and such on my purchase of these units Martin</Content>
