		<Content>I have two (2) Olevia LT30HV televisions (linkies). I have a PS3 and an Explorer 8000HD cable box for using Comcast. The TV is very strange as it has a low 480p/480i only input, and regular up to 1080i input. Both are component video input. It also has a DVI input but I don't use it, as well as other lower inputs. I want to be able to use both the PS3 and Comcast Cable Box on the 1080i resolution. It is only a 30inch tv - but still.. its what I have right now. I recently become disabled (permenantly??) and have to watch my pennies I suspect for rest of my life. Ok cut to the chase: PS3 Directly to TV gives at times drops in the signal where the tv cuts off. It doesn't happen that often, and only happens at the higher resolution - but still it happens. When hooking the explorer and the ps3 to a switcher then to the tv (its a powered switcher by cables to go), the same thing happens on both from the comcast video through the 8000hd, and the ps3. The comcast box by itself to the tv - doesn't do this. It works - but that forces me to use PS3 in 480i/480p mode. Not too great on the latest games. I was thinking that the TV is programmed to only allow a certain level of signal to work and anything lower it cuts off - saying there is no signal. I suspect this because most of the drop outs happen during the inbetween sections where a commerical is, or the inbetween sections of the games. I say most - because sometimes it just happens. SO my question is this - has anyone else have any experience with said happenings with other tv's? If so is there a way of fixing it like with an amplifier? I just bought the switch - but can return it to Amazon if I can find a switch with an amplifier - but my quandry is that if I do this, how can I be sure that the signal level will be high enough (even with an amplifier) to ensure I don't get drop outs? I was thinking if I can't find the amplifier with a switch, then I could just put one between the switch and the tv - thus amplifying both the ps3 and comcast box. I know this tv is several years old, and only a 30inch... but considering i have two of them - I would like to keep them going for a while. They have a great picture otherwise. Of course I am hoping and praying for dirt cheap OLED TVs that do not fade and die in a matter of months - but I suspect that dream is many years away. Michael</Content>
