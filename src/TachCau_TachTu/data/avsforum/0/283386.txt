		<Content>For this sequel the change in the overall look of the restored Bu-ray version is bigger compared to Part 1. Especially with the contrast and brightness boosting. To others the change may be too jarring for them. Give it time and you will get used to it. Film grain is intact (grain haters or Patton lovers stay away!) No wax city here and no EE observed. Unlike other HD transfers this is not going to look as sharp as those other movies like I' Robot . The Godfather I and II overall is a very good transfer preserving the artistic intent of the filmakers There is nothing to argue about the overall PQ and the restored version. If Godfather is just an award winning movie like A Passage to India no one is going to make a fuss about it. But it is the Godfather where over 30 years people has seen it numerous times and has grown accustomed to how the way it looks. Unlike Bram Stoker's Dracula where the restored version made the movie different and actually changed the complexion of the movie because of color change and reduction of brightness and contrast that resulted in barely visible sets and actors. With the Godfather the increase in brightness and contrast you can now actually see more of the scenes especially the backgrounds. There is a side effect for boosting them of course, the picture can lose fine details if cranked up too high. Fortunately for Godfather its soft overall to begin with so this side effect for the most part is not distinct. The new restored version has warmer look than the older DVD. I personally prefer warm instead of the cold look Now bring on Iron Man</Content>
