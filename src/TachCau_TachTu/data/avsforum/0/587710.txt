This will be my second major home theater build. The first was a dedicated room in our Palm Springs, CA home. The outcome was fairly successful for our purposes. I have included a link to my website that has pictures of the construction process here. My second home theater was the conversion of the 2nd bedroom in our apartment. Being an apartment, nothing permanent could be done, and this room was also used for other purposes. The only construction was for the purpose of mounting of small, motorized 84" diagonal 16:9 projection screen. Although we enjoyed the small bedroom theater immensely, it doesn&#8217;t really qualify as a home theater &#8220;build.&#8221; This brings us up to present day. My wife and I just purchased a new townhome with a full, unfinished basement, pictured here. As you can see, the basement has its challenges with the location of the HVAC, plumbing and support beam. However, thanks to many of the wonderful suggestions of fellow AVSers, I have settled in on a design for the new theater. In designing the theater area, it was important that the basement maintain an &#8220;open&#8221; feel to it for entertaining. One of the challenges that I still face are the water lines running everywhere. It is important that the equipment rack and projector not be located right below water/sewer lines that may start to leak some day. I have not yet determined where the equipment room will be located. We also would like to add a bar somewhere into the mix. Here is the initial design that I have come up with: I currently already have much of the a/v equipment for the theater. I may do some swapping out of individual components, but for the most part the equipment listed above is what I will be using. The following issues are still to be determined and any input is greatly appreciated: Where to put the equipment room &#8211; I would ultimately like to have enough room for two racks, in the event that I do a distributed audio/video system throughout the entire home. Storage location for DVDs and CDs &#8211; One thought was to locate all the software in the equipment room. Bar location The time frame for this project completion no later than December 2009.
