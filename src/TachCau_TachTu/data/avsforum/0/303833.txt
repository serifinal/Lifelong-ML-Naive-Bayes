		<Content>I was on the EMPtek website and noticed that they have their EW on-wall speakers on clearance for $99 each. I called and spoke with one of their sales people and he said it was a limited buy and that they are closing out their remainng inventory. The review on the EMPtek website is good and I noticed that Audioholics gave these speakers a good review. Has anyone heard them? Thanks Odd-E-O</Content>
