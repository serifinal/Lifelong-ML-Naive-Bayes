		<Content>Hey Guys, I need to record only certain shows on my Scientific Atlantic Explorer 8240 HDC DVR to my computer. Once the shows are on my computer I need to be able to burn them to blu-rays for archives. Please leave clear and specific direction. Also, list any other equipment needed are where it can be purchased. Thanks</Content>
