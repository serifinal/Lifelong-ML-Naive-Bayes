		<Content>Hi all, finally underway on a room with room theater in the basement and have a door question for you. 3 walls are up against exterior concrete walls (with a 1-4" gap for square and some pipes that were in the way.) Ceiling will be isolated by sitting on top of the 1/2" short walls. The 4th wall separates the theater from the rest of the basement. This wall has the doors for the theater entrance. This is a double stud wall. I'm going with GG+DD on both sides of the double stud wall. DD+GG on one side of the ceiling and the rest of the theater walls. * Because the rest of the basement will include a photography studio and I need the distance shooting from way back in the theater sometimes, I absolutely must have double doors that will be 5' and 6'8" tall. I'm concerned my doors are going to be the weak point by far for sound leakage in this theater. Right now, I'm planning a flush slab door, solid core, 1-3/4", with T-astral covering seam of the two doors. What's the best I can do to treat this entrance? I have several ideas, but maybe there are others... 1) Go with door as above but as an exterior door, so it will have sill and jambs with weather stripping. I got a price on this of $410. 2) Go with door as above but as an interior door, then use Zero Internation seals. Door would be about $120 and Zero seals would be $611. 3) Communicating doors? Possibly using an exterior type door on the theater side and a solid core interior type door on the outside of the double stud wall. I'm afraid the communicating could look weird, but I'm not ruling it out if it will make a big difference. Other thing is, maybe modifying one of the options above with 3/4" MDF and GG on the inside of a door. Question there is, do I need to order special hinges for adding that kind of mass to the door? I'm trying to spend around $1000 or less on the door, but I want to make sure it's a good solution so all the other work doesn't go to waste.</Content>
