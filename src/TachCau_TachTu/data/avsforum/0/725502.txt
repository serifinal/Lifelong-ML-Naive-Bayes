		<Content>I have a house with a walkout basement. I was thinking I had a sump pit, and was planning to add a pump to protect against water intrusion. We had a plumber in for other reasons, and my wife found this out: Quote: Well, turns out we don't have a sump pit. Its sewage drainage if we were to finish the bath. Plumber said that it doesn't have a sump pit because it's a walk-out basement most likely. (Nathan [the builder] isn't here with them). Anyway, he could put a pump in but then we wouldn't be able to finish the bathroom. If they were to do it there, they would have to make it where it drains out the back because of the garage. I'll get his contact info if we want to look into the possibility of creating a sump pit or something. On further discussion, she learned: Quote: Okay, spoke to him a little more about it. He said estimate around $350 to do it +labor for doing the pipes for the drains in the current hole. I asked him about doing the bathroom down the road and he said an option would be to cut a square in the foundation, dig down, and set in a bucket to catch the water table if it were to rise. Sounds like for now at least, we can do the sump pump. This brings up two questions in my mind: 1. Are there normally no sump pumps in walkout basements? The place is new, and its been dry, but its partially finished, and in time I'd like to add a theater and a bath. Seemed like a logical thing to add, is this unnecessary? 2. Given that I am likely to add a bath in the future, seems like perhaps I shouldn't use the existing hole? Is there any science to placing these things? I think they are placed on the perimeter of the house to tie in to the french drains, correct? If so, do people suspect the drains run around the garage? They did excavate my garage (then filled it - not sure if that makes sense, but my foundation walls run up for the space under the garage, but there is no basement space there), not sure how they would design the french drains in that case. That said, here is a layout of my place: In the unfinished space, D-1 is where the bath is roughed. D-2 is a logical place to add a basement bedroom. I don't plan to add one (if I add the HT, I need some storage), but it has a full sized window for egress, so adding the pit at spot #3 might be a future albatross. The middle D area has the furnace, hot water heater, and a few other things. Spot #2 would be beside the furnace, but is adjacent to the garage which makes me wonder if it is a useful place for a sump pit. Any thoughts?</Content>
