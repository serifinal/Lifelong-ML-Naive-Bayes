		<Content>Ok, i have a Panasonic th-50phd6 and it is not turning on. I push the power button and the LED turns green, and i hear about 4 clicks and the fan starts to spin up, but shuts off, and the picture never comes up, the LED stays green. I don't getting any blinking lights like other problems i've read about here in the forum. Somebody please help.</Content>
