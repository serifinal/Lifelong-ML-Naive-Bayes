		<Content>I'm pretty disappointed with the totally disjointed and (un)seamless integration between Powerdvd and MyMovies 2.46 when playing BluRay ISO's for example. I am about to try Arcsoft TMT but wondered what others' experiences were. It's frequent that I get "stuck" in PowerDVD after launching and playing a Bluray title from MyMovies, and I can't get back to Media Center interface with my media center remote, forcing me to get up and and fiddle with the mouse/keyboard, and basically killing the 10' experience. When Purevideo was doing MPEG2 decoding, that integration was seamless with no annoying spawning of a separate player app. I wonder if we'll ever get to that same level of integration with Vista Media Center? Anyone have a tip on how the heck I exit the PowerDVD app with my media center remote after I've hit STOP on Bluray playback?</Content>
