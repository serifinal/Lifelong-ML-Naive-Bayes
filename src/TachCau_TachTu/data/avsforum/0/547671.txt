		<Content>Available also in HD DVD combo Ok before moving on let us forget any comparison in PQ against Beowulf or Ratatouille for the moment. We have to give this disc a chance I got the disc a week ago and quickly pop it in my PC for a quick PQ evaluation. Big mistake Watching this about two feet away from my Dell2408WFP the first thing that I noticed is the minor aliasing happening in the picture. Not to mention some banding in the background and also in some closeup shots Some artifacting and blocking during fast motion (Did I mention this is an action anime?) especially when Deunan and Brialeos are in Notre Dame. Overall the PQ lacks that 3D look and its soft, soft, soft I really want to enjoy this movie so later that day I tried watching this on my 1080p Epson PJ at 120" (BTW all my viewing sets are Spyder calibrated) and although the issues are less noticeable its still distracting to me. Maybe using my 720p PJ will suffice? Its still there. I'm finally satisfied when I hook it up to my Samsung 40" LCD Overall an upgrade in PQ over DVD but in some scenes just marginally. This is a botched transfer. Every CGI based animation I have seen is almost perfect, detailed and sharp. Very 3D looking. There is no reason that this transfer is not going to look like the others. The movie file size is 15.60 GB VC-1. Overall the files occupy 24 GB of the disc. Even if they raise the bit rate on this most of the PQ issues are entirely to be blamed on the transfer. This will retail low enough to be a blind buy. The movie itself is satisfactory for anime fans (IMHO) and casual buyers that wants to see CGI animation with lots of action, mechs, babes and sci-fi stuff. This would have been a demo material in terms of PQ. This initial release is mediocre. Hoping for a remaster in the future.</Content>
