		<Content>Does anyone know if this is true? I'd really like to build an HTPC, but I don't need an additional computer if it can't double as a PVR... What do I need to tell Verizon? The rep was adamant that without one of their boxes, there's no way I could watch TV (from both a technical and non-technical standpoint). Thanks!!!</Content>
