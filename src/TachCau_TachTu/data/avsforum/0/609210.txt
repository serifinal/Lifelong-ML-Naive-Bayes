		<Content>I want to start by saying that I have been reading this forum for years... not only have a researched equipment I was going to buy, I also have dreamed and lived vicariously through many of you buying equipment I could only dream of... and building theaters in your basement that would make me never want to leave home!!! I recently moved to Atlanta GA, and have decided to start finishing my basement and build a theater and game room (one big room). This thread will document my build although it will span a long period of time, because I am building what I can afford when I can afford it. I started framing out my office that will hold my equipment and HTPC. This room will be nothing special... a box with some soffits, and will serve as my learning how to frame... (basic walls are easy, figuring out how to connect a soffit to the wall and have the proper place for drywall gave me some trouble I will post pictures when I can get home and begin to officially document my slow progress. The entire project is permitted (I want to be able to sleep at night... for safety and for following the law) So I will also surely be asking questions like... is this code I am having the HVAC installed Tuesday... I am not even going to attempt to do that myself! Along with posting progress I hope to also be able to ask my many questions in this thread... the first of which is: I am going to build a false wall about three feet inside the end of the room for an acoustically transparent screen, and put my Klipsch RF-83 / RC-64 front sound stage behind that. If I build a stage, can I focus on building the stage only in front of the false wall / screen and place the speakers directly on concrete behind the screen (unfinshed space will be full of bass traps, etc)(on speaker spikes). Will that have any negatative side effects to the sound? If the speakers are too low, could I build small boxes (think speaker platform) behind the false wall as speaker stands and only fill those up with sand... and the stage with insulation??? I am sure pictures would help explain this... I will try to get my idea documented and post it up. Thanks for everyone's help over the years... you have given me great ideas and the encouragement to try and tackle this myself!</Content>
