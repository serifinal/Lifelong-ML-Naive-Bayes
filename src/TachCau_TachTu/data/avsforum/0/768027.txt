		<Content>We're just finishing up a home renovation and I'm considering how to setup our home theater now. As you can see from the attached floorplan image, our space is a little unique, and I'd really love as many opinions as I can get on: 1. Speaker Placement. Here, I'm thinking a pretty typical setup, correct me if I'm wrong. Center speaker under the 50" plasma, 2 front speakers placed at appropriate spots to left and right. 2 surrounds, placed at where Dolby's site would suggest we place them just behind the viewing area and slightly higher than sofa level (the mantle on the fireplace will do great - no, fireplace doesn't work) and I'll probably mount the other on the wall beside the door. Subwoofer where it should go and then I'm also thinking another surround speaker there on the back wall, between those two windows. 2. Speaker Type/Size (feel free to be specific). Here is where I'm pretty stuck. I don't know how much I'll need to get good sound without overkill. As you can see, our ceilings are pretty high. This is all also one massive room. The Blue part is the kitchen, the Green part is the tv/theater room. There is no wall in between these 2 rooms. Hearing the TV in the kitchen is not really a concern. I'd rather focus on just getting quality sound in the TV area. However, I read someplace that I needed to take all of the space into consideration because of sound bouncing and scattering, so I'm not sure what speakers would be best for this size space and how its laid out. The chimney between the rooms, extends the whole way from floor to ceiling. Everything is to scale, so you can see that its not too awful big. The viewing/listening area will be 9 feet from the front of the TV. I'm a little worried about the high ceilings (13.5 ft). I'd be very curious to hear what you all may think as far as giving me some advice on some options I may want to consider for this space. Consider price not a real consideration. It's important in the sense that I don't want to overspend, but I also don't want to go to Best Buy and just get whatever. I currently own a Polk surround sound setup that I bought in 1998 that has treated me wonderfully during the past 10 years, but I didn't want to just go back to that brand just because. If there is something else out there I should consider, I'm all ears. Thanks a lot for any responses, I'd really value any/all insights.</Content>
