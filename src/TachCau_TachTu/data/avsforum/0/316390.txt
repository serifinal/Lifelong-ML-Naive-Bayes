		<Content>I was just curious if anyone ever got an anser or a fix on that odd flickering on certain scenes (this is not in reference to the 48hz mode btw). I mean i noticed it quite a few times already, but as i've had them operate on my tv enough just to get a panel without dead pixels i'm inclined to want to know if anyone really got the issue solved or not.</Content>
