		<Content>This thread and poll complement another poll I left about protection provided by plug-in surge suppressors. Please add your response to it too. The following questions are basic issues regarding getting protection from a surge suppressor. Answer the question only if you AGREE. Leave the selection unanswered if you DISAGREE. Thank you!</Content>
