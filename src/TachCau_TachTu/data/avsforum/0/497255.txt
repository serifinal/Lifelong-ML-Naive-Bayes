		<Content>We can dream, right? When I'm elected King, we'll be able to buy one of these: My modest home home theater has five HDMI sources and just a single "legacy" component video source. I can't remember the last time I had a svideo connector in use, much less a composite video source. Who on earth needs a receiver with eight svideo/analog inputs? It's time for receiver manufacturers to join us here in the 21st century and stop being stingy with HDMI inputs!</Content>
