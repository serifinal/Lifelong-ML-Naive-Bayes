		<Content>So I was watching this Blu-ray and I already know what to expect about the style and look of the movie. BTW this movie is a musical a reminder to those who thinks its Jack Sparrow swinging those blades I really enjoyed this movie version I'm already familiar with this movie having seen it twice on broadway (don't ask ) and owning the soundtrack with Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Lovett (check out the performance in youtube). I can tell you now that its not Shoot 'Em Up in PQ. Even though both are sharp and detailed. Sweeney Todd is much more inconsistent. The PQ fluctuates from excellent to very good. Minor DNR is applied as well. The dark scenes is where we lose some of the details. This happens especially when Sweeney first met Mrs Lovett. There is also some weird "ringing" in the backgrounds. Both day and night scenes. I don't think some of these issues are noticeable in most calibrated viewing sets but they are noticeable on mine. The grainy picture (filmakers intent) is good in hiding these artifacts so it may not be problematic to some. Judging from early reviews where its mostly positive it looks like their equipment can't resolve some this PQ issues. Good for them Hmm what else? . . . . . oh yeah the digital airbrushing applied to Depp for every close up on most scenes! In Resident Evil 3 from Blu-ray this was also applied to Ms. Jovovich so weird On Sweeney Code: Total Video Title Codec Length Movie Size Disc Size Bitrate Bitrate Main Audio Track Secondary Audio Track ----- ------ ------- -------------- -------------- ------- ------- ------------------ --------------------- Sweeney Todd VC-1 1:56:22 29,153,937,408 45,585,051,868 33.40 23.83 Dolby TrueHD 5.1 3339Kbps (48kHz/16-bit) DD AC3 5.1 640Kbps PLAYLIST REPORT: Name: 00000.mpls Size: 29,153,937,408 bytes Length: 1:56:22 (h:m:s) Total Bitrate: 33.40 Mbps Description: FILES: Name Size Length Time In Time Out ---- ---- ------ ------- -------- 00000.M2TS 29,153,937,408 1:56:22 0:00:00 1:56:22 VIDEO: Codec Bitrate Description ----- ------- ----------- VC-1 Video 23828 kbps 1080p / 23.976fps AUDIO: Codec Language Bitrate Description ----- -------- ------- ----------- Dolby TrueHD Audio English 3339 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz / 16-bit (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps) Dolby Digital Audio English 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz Dolby Digital Audio French 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz Dolby Digital Audio German 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz Dolby Digital Audio Italian 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz Dolby Digital Audio Spanish 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz Dolby Digital Audio Spanish 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz</Content>
