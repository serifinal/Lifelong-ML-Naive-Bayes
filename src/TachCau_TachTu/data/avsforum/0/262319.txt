		<Content>I thought with the latest firmware the PS3 would turn off automatically after downloads have finished from the PSN store. Well I can't find anywhere to activate this. I have looked in the Energy Saving settings in the main Settings section but it only gives you option to turn off if unused for 1 hour or more. Any ideas? tboy</Content>
