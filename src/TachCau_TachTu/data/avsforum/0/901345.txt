		<Content>Hi all. Just bought myself a Kuro 5010FD and am planning the next stage of getting the most of my HT components in our new living room (oh yeah, new house too). I am aware of the downfalls of trying to design my HT around my living room, but we simply don't have the room for a dedicated HT. I hope to tap the minds of those here who have more experience than I do, which is just about everyone. For now, I'm going to skip the issue of trying to wire my surrounds in exterior walls with fire blocking and insulation. I already know it's going to be a nightmare. 1. First question... what are the better RF-capable all-in-one remotes out there? I want to put my components in a large closet behind the wall I plan to mount the TV on, but will need the RF remote. It looks like the Harmony 890, Monster Control 300, and a couple of URC options will fit the bill. Any preferences out there? 2. I use Comcast HD Digital Cable at my house. Comcast's Motorola HD-DVRs have not been great performers for me. I already have good ventilation for it and plan to run a good quality coax to the closet for it. My cable is connected to a splitter for my internet. Is this harming the signal? Any other recommendations for getting the most from this POS? Alternatively, my TV is CableCard ready. I like this idea because I could enable PIP for it. However, I haven't found a way in researching aftermarket DVRs to maintain PIP, DVR, and On Demand functions. Is there a way to have PIP, HD DVR, and On Demand? 3. I love my Onkyo TX-SR805. One great feature is the passthrough, allowing the AVR to control the show and use the TV as just a monitor. Am I losing any video quality by doing this? If I get the smarter remote, I could easily still have one-touch source switching with the HDMI cables going directly to the TV. 4. Wiring. I really like the clean look of wall-mounted wiring housings, such as those with banana plug connections on a wall plate. This is what I am planning in the closet wall. Is there any loss in the extra connection, as opposed to just leaving extra speaker wire to run to the receiver? Any opinions on the Monster In-Wall Power Center to use for the outlet behind the TV? Other options? 5. Old surrounds. I have a pair of BA VRS Micro dipole speakers for 2 of the surround channels. What I've read says the dipoles are best used as L/R surrounds rather than backs. To put them at right angles to the seating area, they will be close to the back wall. Is it going to affect the sound by facing one of the dipole drivers at a wall 12" away? 6. New speakers. I have 2 pairs of new speakers to purchase. First, a pair of in-wall rear surrounds. I understand that the newer BA speakers are not that great. Any recommendations for a relatively close match to the other speakers in the system. I am also going to wire some outdoors and run them off zone 2 on the AVR. I'm looking in the <$300 range. It's a fairly small hang out area back there, maybe 15' to the furthest seating position. Any recommendations? They will be partially covered under the eaves of the house. Obviously I'm just full of questions about this rather large project. Thanks to any advice you all can offer. -Mark</Content>
