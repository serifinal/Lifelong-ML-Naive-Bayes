		<Content>I have a Canon HV20 camcorder and I want to be able to transfer the video from my MiniDV tapes directly to a firewire external hard drive... this bypassing my computer. Is this possible? Or what about recording directly to an external hard drive instead of the internal MiniDV tape?</Content>
