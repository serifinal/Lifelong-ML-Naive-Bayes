		<Content>Quote: Nolan and Thomas both brought up the anticipated Blu-ray version and its capabilities. Nolan summed it up by saying, "The Blu-ray, in particular, will be able to actually use the shifted aspect ratios as it appears on the IMAX screen because the 16:9 aspect ratio is sufficiently different from the 2:4 that you'll actually see a shift on the Blu-ray. The resolution on the Blu-ray is clear enough that you can actually see difference in grain structure and sharpness. So I think it will be quite spectacular." There are a couple of elements that fans will not be seeing. Thomas said that it's "unlikely" that the DVD will contain alternate takes of Heath Ledger as the Joker [during the junket, the filmmakers and fellow cast members mentioned how Ledger would occasionally riff or improvise some of his dialogue], but pointed out that they have not decided anything for sure yet. Another popular feature that THE DARK KNIGHT DVD won't have according to Roven: deleted scenes. "We know there won't be any deleted scenes because there never are," says Roven, noting director Nolan puts everything of importance in the actual movie. "There weren't any on BATMAN BEGINS and there weren't any on this one." Apart from that, Nolan promised us some "very interesting extras". The man hasn't failed us thus far, so we'll be waiting in excited anticipation. http://www.ifmagazine.com/new.asp?article=6466 The bolded part sounds verrrry interesting.</Content>
