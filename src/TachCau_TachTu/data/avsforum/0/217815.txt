		<Content>I didn?t see a list of exclusive games for the xbox, so I decided to make one. I grabbed my information from secondary sources so please let me know if anything is incorrect or if new games need to be added. I am still looking for the best way to keep up to date with this list; suggestions are accepted. Next to the title of the game is its score from metacritic. I feel that these give a quick, general idea of the game?s critical reception. I like to wait at lest a month for all of the scores to get factored in. For the Japan only games I use the famitsu scores. This score is out of 40, so I divide the score by 40 and post the equivalent out of 100 score in parenthesis. I did not include any downloadable titles, they may be added later. Post any other information that you feel is essential to this list. I hope you enjoy-I learned a few things while making it.
