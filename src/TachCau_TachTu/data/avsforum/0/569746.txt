		<Content>Getting ready to start to update my daily battle with the wife and trying to make her understand that a "man cave" means I really don't give a crap about what she thinks and why in the heck should I buy more than 1 chair? Who Am I? My name is Jay and I live in Michigan. I have been reading AVS for 6+ years now and am constantly amazed at what a tight community of braniacs can come up with, it is simply amazing what you all can do. I am a jokester and like to goof around after a long day at a stressful job. I am also poor/cheap/thrifty.. pick your choice as long as it save me money!! Purpose The purpose of this build is to finish my basement and have a man cave. I have had to do several projects over the years in order to get me to this point. I even had to bribe my wife with $1000 of incentives to get all of her stuff out of the basement after 4+ years of asking nicely. It took me a few weeks and 120$ in Rubbermade totes to finally get everything into a storage unit. If she gives me any crap, I figured I would just stop payment on the storage unit and that problem of clutter would be solved Along with a man cave, I lost a battle and had to finish a section of the basement for a home office. I will do this reluctantly as she is a master at stacking up junkmail into tower like piles that seem to defy gravity. Budget? As cheap as possible. Think coupons, craigslist, Ebay, hand-me-downs, rebates, and items found on the side of the road.. I doubt very seriously I will be in this house in 2 years which is why I wanted to get some practice on this one! Does my wife really have horns? No, absolutely not, I have beautiful wife who is awesome, she is supermom with a career and has a hectic schedule. Even though I love her to death, she is not immune from my humor. Depending on the day and her mood... my jokes either get a laugh from her, or I sleep on the couch. Help Wanted!!! While normally I am stubborn and think a hammer will fix everything. I am welcoming anyone who wants to throw out opinions and suggest ideas. Feel free to offer services such as heckling, project managers, motivators, interior designers, engineering, inventors, snake oil sales, etc... I am in no race to put up drywall if I can take time to do something unique and learn a little more about things in the process. Positions filled to date: -- CAD Expert, Electical Guru = Mark (My neighbor) --Jerk who suckered me into helping him finish his HT before I completed mine = Chris (My so called friend) Planning Phase So after living off of a notebook scribbled design for 2 years, my neighbor Mark offered to CAD up the room for me. After I had the dimensions of just the theater side of the room and read many threads here on AVS, I decided to go with a 13' seating position. Based on the Dolby and THX website, my neigher Mark also drafted up ideal speaker placement. Lighting was designed due to the fact that I have a touch of OCD and like to have things symmetrical so we ended up with 10 recessed lighting cans and 3 different zones. This is what the overall layout of the basement looks like: Build Timeline Journal 3/29/2008 Early on I made a decision to frame in my center wall under the I beam because I wanted the room to be as wide as I possibly could. Well this worked great until I started to think about attaching drywall... I wanted to be able to screw in the drywall at the top, not 10 inches below. HD and Lowes folks had no real answers other than gluing 2x6s to the beam or use a 1/4' plywood strip 6" wide behind the 2x6 and nail or drill/bolt it to the I-beam. I was not really happy with any of these suggestions and spent an hour wandering the isles when it hit me to use a 90 degree bracket (angle Zmax) and a 2x2x8 furring strip (5 of them). I attached the brackets to the joist and then screwed the furring strips. I plan on wedging something behind them before I put drywall up just in case, but I don't think that is necessary. Well it looks like I can only include 10 links to pictures so I learned something new tonight and will have to include pics below in another post</Content>
