		<Content>Have a Intel P5B motherboard, with Auzentech X-Plosion 7.1 Cinema, and an ATI Radeon 3800 series This MB has the SoundMax AD1988A as audio chipset - also 7.1 I have PowerDVD 8 and TotalMedia Theatre installed All drivers and software are fully updated The problem is getting reliable 7.1 output from the my HTPC, particularly from TMT/X-Plosion combo I am outputting via analog to a 7.1 analog in receiver - Onkyo SR606 I made the following observations: 1. problem decribed here effects both compressed multi-channel formats (DTS, DTSMA, AC3), as well as 5.1 and 7.1 LPCM 2. When using PowerDVD, HTPC outputs proper 7.1 analog sound using a Bluray disc, whether I use the X-Plosion or the SoundMAx to output 3a. When using TMT, HTPC outputs proper 7.1 sound using a Bluray disc, when I use SoundMAx to output 3b. BUT when I use TMT and the X-Plosion, it seems as if I get single channel sound from each of the 7 channels i.e. identical signal comes from all 7 speakers. This sounds terrible with the actor/speakers voice coming from all 7 speakers _________________ I had a basic X-Plosion 7.1 also, swapped this in, but same problem. Also tried the previous approved version of X-Plosion drivers, same resultls as above So in lay terms, it seems that the "communication" between the TMT software/codecs and the X-Plosion is flawed - somewhere in sequence, there is an instruction to output combined mono output to all 7 speakers Any ideas on how I fix this? If I contact TMT tech support, I suspect they will bounce me to Auzentech X-Plosion support. When I call Auzentech, they will like do the bounce to TMT (one obvious solution is to stick with the Soundmax only, but having purchased the Auzentech in belief it might give slightly better analog output, I was hoping to get the X-Plosion working) BTW one other observation. Nero 9 seems to suffer from exactly the same problem, altho source in this case was AVCHD structure with a variety of multichannel audio formats Help appreciated Jeff</Content>
