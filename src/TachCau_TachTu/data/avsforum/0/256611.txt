		<Content>So I just bought an HP laptop (dv4-1117nr) and I have hooked up the hdmi output to my Philips 34PW9819/17 hdtv (with a dvi input), with no luck. I bought a DVI female to HDMI male adapter and hooked it to a dvi cable to the tv (bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=7129396&st=hdmi+to+dvi&lp=1&type=product&c p=1&id=1110262781781). The screen just stays black, which means that something is happening, otherwise blue. But I can swear that I have tried every possible graphic properties option and it will not work. I know that there are things like HDCP, but I have read the specs for both devices and they say that they are compliant. Philips Manual says: "DVI - DVI is a specific digital input allowing encrypted transmission of uncompressed HD content. DVI includes HDCP (high-bandwidth digital content protection), which is supported by Hollywood, satellite providers, and most of the consumer electronics industry. DVI is gaining momentum and quickly becoming an industry standard for the consumer to view high-definition material while keeping content protected." Also: "NOTE: This television is designed to accept high definition signals 1080i and 480p as specified by the Electronic Industries Association standard EIA770.3. Digital devices from different manufacturers have the possibility of differing output standards which my cause difficulties for the television to properly display." I tried a single link hdmi to dvi cable today and it did the same thing... Otherwise it could be my video card, but it is HDCP too... (Mobile Intel(R) 4 Series Express Chipset Family) Sorry to write so much, but I've done my work trying to figure this one out. And it wouldnt let me post a link yet, so I took the www out. Thanks, Scott</Content>
