		<Content>Welcome to my Basement Room which I call "Cinema and Brew". My room after a year of procrastination on the floor covering is finally ready for display. The size of the room is 24 by 20 plus the bump out section at the stairs. Originally my plan for the room was to replace a non functional bar/counter that was in the room, and put a pool table in the room. Then I came across AVS Forum and decided this type of room would get much better usage of the space than a bar with a pool table. When I purchased this house it had a wall of oak storage cabinets at which is now the back side of the theater. It was those cabinets that determined stain color for the bar and trim work. When I started this room other than the cabinets the non paneled walls were drywall with bright white paint. The ceiling was exposed floor joist and with plumbing to the kitchen above so ceiling tile was really my only option. Flooring in the room was painted concrete with a patch of carpet at the bottom of the stairs. Lighting was a couple of harsh eight foot florescent ceiling fixtures attached to the floor joist. The placement of the new oak bar in the room was determined by the existing plumbing of the old bar sink. Now I have warm inviting room that friends ask to come over watch ball games, have movie nights or just get together and have beverages and conversation. All the work I have done myself, electrical, bar build, 100" DIY screen, ceiling tile, laminate floor, carpet tiles, etc, etc, etc. I had never attempted many of the skills required to complete this project prior to this build, so it was a learning experience. For those of you on the fence if you can do a build by yourself, this room is proof that you can. Just take your time, plan it out and be patient. You can do it. You will make mistakes along the way, and the list of things you would do differently will become lengthy, as will the list of future enhancements. The mistakes you make probably are only going to be noticed by you. Your guests will enjoy and be impressed by your accomplishments. But most importantly is the satisfaction and enjoyment you will receive once you start using your room. I want to thank everyone that in the past that have shared information here on these forums. It has been those threads that have helped give me the tools, confidence and motivation to get my space to where it is today. Because of that, I have a responsibility to other readers of this forum to display my results so they may benefit from my build as I have from many others. Enjoy the pictures and some time at Cinema and Brew.</Content>
