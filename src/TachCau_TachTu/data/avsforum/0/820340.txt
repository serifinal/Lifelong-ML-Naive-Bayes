		<Content>I have an external hard drive hooked up to my Samsung television. I constantly update my external with new photos and videos, but the television still recognizes old file names and deleted files. I have 75 gigs of media, is it that it takes a while to refresh? Or is there a another option to speed this up? Thanks so much!</Content>
