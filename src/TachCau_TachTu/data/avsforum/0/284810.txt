		<Content>Howdy ya'll. So I'm in the process of having my basement finished, and as part of this, am building a dedicated Home Theatre room. This will not be some 'elite' level room, but will nonetheless be given as much of a pro-touch as possible within my pretty decent budget. Unfortunately for me / you, I don't have 3-D plans in AutoCAD or some fun application, but what I lack in that, I will make up for in photos. The premise of the basement is such: - Home Theatre room - Nanny suite (we have a live-in nanny coming within the month) with attached bathroom - Children's play room - Library / Sitting room / extension of child's play room The nanny suite shares a wall with the HT room (a load bearing wall), so I will be doing the following to manage that, and to manage the quality of the sound in that room. Two of the walls (front, and left) are exterior concrete walls. - Double studded wall separating nanny room and HT room (rooms currently separated by the load bearing wall - so add 2nd wall) - insulate wall and ceiling with fibreglass insulation - 5/8" DD/GG on all four walls and on wall in nanny suite (5 walls total) - 1/2" 3D/GG on ceiling I'm VERY new to this process, but am trying to learn at an accelerated pace so I can make most of the right decisions now rather than later. That being said, I will be soliciting opinions on process and electronics / equipment, should you be willing to provide it. All of your $.02 are appreciated, even if I can't make it happen. Anyway, enough of that - here's an early floor plan. Things may have changed somewhat, or may not be well explained on the drawing. The HT room will be sealed, with doors at the bottom of the stairs, and at load bearing wall. Here's the layout. The stairs come down towards the bottom of the picture - with the HT room to the left. Dimensions of the room (when finished) will likely be about 12ft W x 16.5ft L.</Content>
