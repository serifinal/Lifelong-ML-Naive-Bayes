		<Content>OK all you slowpokes.... Can't get that last 10% that takes 90% of the time to complete? Hung your projector too soon? Wife won't let you paint the ceiling black so now you can't decide WHICH color to paint it? Still stuck on the Blu-ray or HD question? Whatever your excuse, I can motivate you (OK, and maybe me at the same time). I'm 2.5+ years into my build. I've got HVAC and Plumbing rough inspections. I'm THIS close to an electric rough inspection (been that way for about 3 months now). I've put down dricore and I have one wall to attach RSIC clips and then fire block and I should be good for a close-in inspection. BritinVA wants to know when I'll start a proper thread. WHEN I MAKE ENOUGH PROGRESS TO ACTUALLY SHOW SOMETHING. Maybe this is it. I got a little motivated last weekend and accomplished a few pesky things. BigMouthinDC says that if I finish before him, he'll "never live it down." Yeah? I'm calling him out. He's been LOGANED! I'd LOGAN BritinVA, too, just on general principle, but he's already so far done it just wouldn't be fair. When I beat him, the humiliation would just be too great for any man to bear. BigMouthinDC....if you were going any slower stuff would have to start coming OFF your walls. And now carboranadum wants to lay odds on Big. ODDS? I'll give you odds. I'll give you odds I can fire up my compressor, oil my nailer and shoot myself in the foot faster than carboranadum can pick up a hammer. You think I'm kidding? Huh, do ya? Anyone else want a piece of me? Huh, punk? Yeah, you. I'm talking to YOU! You want motivation? I got your motivation, right here. I've attached a couple of pics. I'll take and post a few more. Keep in mind, these are as of 1/2006. Anyone else want to get LOGANED? Come on. I double dog dare ya!

HEY! If there's one thing I learned after 20 years in IT, it's never do it twice if you can do it once. Two. Two Things. Never do it yourself if you can get someone else to do it for you. I'M not maintaining that list. It would take time from my build. http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showt...8#post14523548</Content>
