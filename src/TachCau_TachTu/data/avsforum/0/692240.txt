		<Content>I heard the Bose TrueLife demo yesterday at CC. At $1799 it is way out of range but for $999 Acoustimass 10 speaker system sounds ok. My question is: Can I beat this system's sound quality/clarity/Setup/Price by going with other brands like Polk, Klipsch (Onkyo or Pioneer). Please suggest some setups. Anks</Content>
