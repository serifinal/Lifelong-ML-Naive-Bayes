		<Content>It's about time I started my theater build thread. But unlike many of the threads here (not all!) I am starting at the true beginning of the build: Planning Stage! A short prequel history, by Riblet: I am single, no wife and no kids. To borrow a quote from Eric Cartman: "I can do what I want!" So when I put my house up for sale last year, I started looking for a new house with very limited requirements. It had to be a good value, with an eye for future resale. It had to have an adequate yard for my two dogs. And it had to have a great space to build a home theater. After visiting 48 houses in person (and looking at many more online), I bought a great one. Surprisingly, most of the 48 houses did not qualify. The beginning state: The house has a bonus room upstairs over the garage with an adequate layout to use for a temporary home theater. Before starting the dedicated room, I set up the bonus room. I had to cover a window, hang a 12' long heavy blackout drape, put up some black velvet, run cables, etc. Meanwhile, the basement was analyzed. My friends were consulted. Reams of graph paper destroyed. All this and more to pick the right spot in the basement to build the theater. Here is the temporary setup, with sunlight blasting through a 12'wide 6' high window, and five 100watt flood lights all turned on. Black Velvet rocks! Here is the futuretheater area, looking towards the daylight wall. Notice there are a few obstacles in the way, but nothing that could not be worked around. Here is facing from the front wall with the two windows back towards the utility area. Notice the return vent on the left, and the two return vents on the right. A drain from the main floor: HVAC return duct for the main floor: Two return ducts for the main floor: The electric power supply is not a problem, with both very short runs from the panel, and plenty of expansion room with two 200 amp service panels. I am working on a Google Sketchup drawing of the whole basement, and will do a more detailed version of just the theater space. Hopefully I can get good feedback to this thread regularly during the design phase. I would rather make a mistake now than having to rework hours of effort later.</Content>
