		<Content>Link to Flickr page for samples of all categories from all 5 volumes here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/21643749@N02/ For anyone who wants to experiment with the samples linked above in their home theater, these samples can be saved to your computer in "large" setting, which is about half the resolution of the actual slide files you've receive from me on disc. Just click on a slide. It will display a bit larger. Look for "All sizes" button on top left of slide. It will re-display with a download button for "large size". NEW!!! Volume 5 (200+ slides plus bonus video content) specs: Disney Trivia: 50 slides (25Q & 25A) Covers animated features. Harry Potter Trivia: 60 slides (30Q & 30a) Covers first five features. Indiana Jones Trivia: 40 slides (20Q & 20A) Covers all four features. Movie Cliches: 10 slides Refreshing Movie Moments V5: 35 new slides with stills from recent 2008 releases, current summer releases and upcoming holiday releases. Template further tweaked from previous volume. Popcorn & Coke, etc.: A smattering of new movie snack slides Now, you're asking.... what is this bonus video content you mentioned? Well, I've created some short (15 to 30 seconds each) "bumpers" that you can use to introduce themed trivia segments. I'm including these for the Indiana Jones, Disney and Harry Potter trivia that I've made for volume 5. But I've also gone back to previous volumes and made video bits for the Star Wars and James Bond trivia sets. (For a hypothetical volume 6, I may do Star Trek, Superman, Alien, Austin Powers or Die Hard, Dirty Harry, or Jason Bourne bits.) They're not award-winning or anything, but are a fun thing that I tried... just to see what my meager computer/video skills could do. I'm sure those of you with the DVD sets of these movie series will recognize some of the backgrounds, etc. I scavenged desktop wallpaper pix, dvd menu screenshot grabs, etc. Whatever I thought could be usable... Vol. 4 (200+ slides) specs: Refreshing Movie Moments: 35 slides (New template layout) James Bond Trivia 2007 Edition: 40 slides (20Q & 20A) Template updated to Daniel Craig. Classic Trivia: 100 slides (50Q & 50A), focusing on classic films. Classic Taglines: 25 new slides, focusing on taglines from pre-1970 films. Template redesigned from previous volume. Thread regarding Volume 4 is here: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=796498 Vol. 3 (170+ slides) specs: Refreshing Movie Moments: 45 slides What's My Job?: 30 slides James Bond Trivia: 40 slides (20Q & 20A) Star Wars Trivia: 40 slides (20Q & 20A) Movie Music Maestros: 20 slides Oscars Vs. Dollars: 15 slides Thread regarding Volume 3 is archived here: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showt...6&page=1&pp=30 Vol. 2 (220+ slides) specs are: Memorable Taglines: 40 slides Refreshing Movie Moments: 40 slides Kid's Trivia: 40 slides (20Q & 20A) Trivia: 100 slides (50 Q & 50a) Thread regarding Volume 2 is archived here: http://archive2.avsforum.com/avs-vb/...5&page=1&pp=30 Vol. 1 (270+ slides) specs are: Trivia: 200 slides (100Q & 100A) Refreshing Movie Moments: 40 slides Movie Lingo: 20 slides Coke Count: 10 slides (5Q & 5A) Talk concerning the first volume is scattered in these two threads: http://archive.avsforum.com/avs-vb/s...highlight=Coke http://archive.avsforum.com/avs-vb/s...y&pagenumber=1 A seperate file (encompassing all 5 volumes) contains over 35 slides for Coke, popcorn, candy, trash, cell phones, etc. This makes for a total of over 1000 slide jpegs. Another year, and the price of everything continues to increase: BLANK DISCS-- With over 1,000 slides--plus video clips now--the collection has grown in size and will not fit onto a CD-R. I now use DVD-R. With the inclusion of the video clips, it is nearly 4GB. Petroleum prices have ended the days of a spool of blank discs nearly free after mail-in rebates... DISC CASES--If it's made of plastic... as discs and cases are, chances are the price of them has increased. PADDED BUBBLE MAILING ENVELOPES--Trying to track down deals; I'm getting relatively good bulk prices from eBay sellers sometimes... POSTAGE--What? The post office increased their rates? I'm shocked! Media and 1st class rates have both increased again. GAS--to make the trips to the post office--the less said about this the better... ugh! PAYPAL--the % they get for their service Now, prices on all the above things haven't increased obscenely (except for gas) but taken as a whole, they do add up. With this in mind, I'll have to increase the minimum Paypal to $7.00. That is sufficient to cover the disc, case, mailing padded envelope, postage and Paypal's % cut of the payment. If interested, Paypal to: sgood3 (at) comcast (dot) net <--I think you can figure out how to make this a valid email address. As always, tips are certainly appreciated, but by no means necessary. The above amount will work for U.S. and Canada. For anyone across a large body of water, PM me and we'll figure out what it will cost to get a disc to you. I'm still only sharing these by snail mail on a disc. No downloading option. (My son's a GA Tech computer science major and thinks this is quaint.) And once you've received a disc, please don't upload them for redistribution elsewhere. I'd like to keep them here in the AVS community. PM with questions and please continue using this thread to post with suggestions on programs to use for making and using these slides, etc. The previous threads are also a wealth of information on how to make great pre-show intros. The tips and tricks you share with fellow members are what makes this forum a terrific community to participate in, and why I enjoy being here. Thanks for your continued interest! Steven P.S. This is not designed to be a playable disc. It is a data disc with raw jpeg picture files on it. Volume 5 has short AVI and VOB video files, too. You are supposed to use your computer and video editing or slideshow creation software to create and author a pre-show slide presentation. Then you burn you completed project to DVD and play that in your DVD player. There are DVD players that can display jpeg photos and video files from a data disc. However, the files as burned on the disc I provide are not arranged in a manner that is very entertaining to watch. Again, this is just a data disc, not a finsihed pre-show presentation. If you are unsure what steps to take, please read through this thread, as well as the previous threads regarding Vol. 2, 3 and 4 (links for which are posted above). Those threads are a wealth of information regarding what programs AVS members have used to create slideshows, what background music they've included, programs they use to burn the finished project to DVD, etc.</Content>
