		<Content>Hello. I'm finally in a position now to start an upgrade on my current Cambridge Soundworks Tower II speakers and matching center/surrounds. My plan is to order 3-4 sets of towers online at once to audition and compare. I've targeted a few brands and just wanted to throw this out there to see if there are other suggestions. Budget is about $1500 for the mains. Looking for places where shipping is free so I only need to pay return shipping. Current room is 13'x16' bedroom, dedicated media room. Listening is split pretty evenly between music, movies and gaming. Music I listen to ranges from older Genesis to hard rock (Ozzy, Type O Negative) to current progressive metal or European metal bands (Dream Theater, Nightwish, Sonata Artica, Leaves Eye, Within Temptation), with many of the latter having female singers. Current speakers I know I am ordering- Aperion Audio 6T's Energy RC-70's from Audio Advisor On the fence- Axiom M80's KEF Iq9's Mordaunt Short Mezzo 6's Mordaunt Short Avanti 908i Definitive Technologies BP7006- BB Magnolia, not sure I have enough room in my current setup for these, my speakers are a little over a foot from the back wall, and have about 18" of space on the inside and about 2 feet on the outisde. Not sure if that is enough space to make them worth auditioning. My biggest limitation is space for the center channel speakers. The ones I have mentioned so far have centers that will fit. The reason I am doing it this way is because most audio stores are 20-40 miles away from me, and with gas prices and driving a truck, I figure the added expense of return shipping is not that much more and makes it worth it to audition in home. Feel free to let throw out other suggestions and where a good place to get them would be. If their centers won't work for me, I'll let you know. Example- Swan Diva's 5.2C will not fit, but the 4.2C does. Not sure if matching towers for that will compare well to the above? Thanks...</Content>
