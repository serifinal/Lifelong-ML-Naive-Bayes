		<Content>What January 2009 BD titles are you planning on purchasing? I bought more than I planned in November and December so I'm really cutting back in January, plus there aren't that many titles that appeal to me. Buy on release: The Pink Panther (Original 1964 Peter Sellers release) Buy at a later date: The Last Emperor Rental: French Connection Zodiac</Content>
