		<Content>I heard the kuro's are pretty much impervious to burn in, but does this older model do 24p / ect. Or am I better off with the new samsung 52" a650. I do a lot of gaming, and have had burn in issues, my local BB has the kuro heavily discounted NIB. so idk, i need to make a descision soon.</Content>
