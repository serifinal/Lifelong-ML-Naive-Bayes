		<Content>I can get the Sony at Best Buy for $1199 and I can get the Samsung at Sam's for the same price. I leaning Samsung, but can't decide. This will be mainly for just watching TV in the master bedroom. Regular TV and some movies - probably not for gaming or much sports. Any opinions? Thanks!!</Content>
