		<Content>Just wondering if those of you who bought Vizio tv back when the hype was going on are still happy with your purchase. I am considering the VU32L at circuit city. I don't have a lot that I can spend on a tv, and yet I keep hearing "buy quality and cry once" in my head. I checked out the tv in person, and it looks like it would be fine for my needs, which would mostly be SD tv. I just want to know about the reliability of these tvs. thanks!</Content>
