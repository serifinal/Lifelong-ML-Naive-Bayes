		<Content>I am in the first group of the RS20 pre order and I just wanted to get some idea on what screen other RS20 owners are planning to using with this projector. I would like to know the size, gain, aspect ratio and brand/model. As for me, I am leaning towards a motorized Stewart ST130 100 to 110", gain 1.3, 16:9. Thanks, Rich</Content>
