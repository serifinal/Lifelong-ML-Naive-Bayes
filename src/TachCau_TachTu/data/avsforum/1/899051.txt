		<Content>I have found only two reviews on-line, both seemed to like it, but other reviews are scarce. Anybody purchased one, yet? It is a price I was waiting for the Sony's and Sammy's to come own to for the Super Bowl. I have a Pioneer 1018ahk w/ Energy speakers, so sound isn't important. I have FiOS and will be getting a PS3 for Christmas.</Content>
