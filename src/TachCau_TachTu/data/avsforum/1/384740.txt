		<Content>I can't sleep over this decision. Both have the same price tag and similar features... I would love to hear from owners of either one and if anyone could help me make this decision I would greatly appreciate it. Btw, sound quality is not a factor in making my decision, and both have plenty of connections. THANKS.</Content>
