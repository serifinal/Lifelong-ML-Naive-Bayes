		<Content>I know there is a lot of stuff on the LC46D64U, I have read a few dozen pages of the 'official' thread and all, it seems like there are a lot of problems BUT as with most online forums, the people with bad experiences are often the most vocal about problems (I know it's true with me and my disdain for Powerbooks... grrr.) Last night I bought an LG 47LG50 (http://us.lge.com/products/model/detail/tv|audio|video_lcd%20flat%20panel__47LG50.jhtml) and it has to go back today anyway because there are 13 stuck pixels in a 1 1/2" square which annoys me. I bought it because I like LG's (my old 32" tv is one) and I got it for about 25% off the usual price as it was some customer love sale at Bestbuy and Futureshop matched & beat it. But I dunno... I'm a little unhappy I guess. The lower left corner is fairly white from some eneven back lighting and last night when it was very dark and the screen was black you can see faint spots that are brighter than others. I have had my eye on the Sharp LC46D64U for a while as I thought (in store at least) the picture was really nice and the thin profile is very nice as well. Some people I work with have Sharps and love them. But then after reading some nightmares on here and a few negative comments elsewhere I got turned off a bit. The LG hasn't been out too long so there isn't much on them yet, whereas the Sharp has been out a while so more people have their opinions on it. I don't really know what to do. Another store has the Sharp on sale which ends today so when I take back my LG in a few hours I could exchange it for the Sharp (for about $20 cheaper I believe).... Buying a TV is so damn stressful!</Content>
