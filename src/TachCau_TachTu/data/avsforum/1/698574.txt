		<Content>We are looking for an upper-level 52" LCD, and we've settled on 2 TVs: 1) the WL140 (basically the W4100 + the internet video link) AND 2) the XBR6 for I know the general difference in specs between the XBR6 and the W-series, but I honestly don't know how much of a difference 10-bit, Deep Color, etc makes. What am I really gaining over the W if I go for the XBR6? Is the quality difference really worth the price?</Content>
