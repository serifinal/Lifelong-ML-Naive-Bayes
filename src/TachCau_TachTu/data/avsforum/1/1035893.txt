		<Content>I'm looking at on-wall HT speaker options (space constrained). I've got a short-list down to the Totem Tribe I (L/R) & 3 (C); or the Morel Vario on-wall. I also looked at the BG Radia 17i/18i, although I heard the Morel Vario were better. I'm located in Colorado, and having a hard time finding demo locations, although will be out in LA in a few weeks so hoping to demo some then. Any recommendations or suggestions between these options, or others that I might have missed?</Content>
