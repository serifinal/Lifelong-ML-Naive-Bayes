		<Content>As I sit here looking for a good price on an 42" Panny plasma, I was wondering if anyone has purchased their HDTV's from any of the online retailers? I see that 6th Ave has a really good price on the set that I want, but I'm just wondering about buying online? Personally, I have never had a bad experience buying online, but I would like to hear your opinions; in particular, buying plasma or LCD tv's online... THANKS!!!</Content>
