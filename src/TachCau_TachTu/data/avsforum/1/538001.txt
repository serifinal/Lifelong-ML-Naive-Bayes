		<Content>I'm a layman who needs advice on the actual difference between 720p and 1080p. I am planning to buy a 32" LCD HDTV. Now I have two models finally in my mind 1. Vizio VO32LF which is 1080p capable 2. Sony KDL-32L4000 which is 720p While my mind leans towards Sony considering their brand image, I am seriuosly concerned about its limited 720p. Is it actually a limitation on a 32"? Will Vizio outperform Sony (between 2 given models)? Is Vizio yet a reliable brand in terms of durability? Is there a significant difference in terms of common TV usage between 720p and 1080p?</Content>
