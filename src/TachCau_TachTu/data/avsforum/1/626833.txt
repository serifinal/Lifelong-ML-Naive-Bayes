		<Content>I want to purchase the Samsung LN52A630 or LN52A550, but my friend wants me to get a Sony because it's "better" and I will be sorry for getting a Samsung. The reason why I opted for a Samsung was because of word of mouth, internet reviews, etc. What Sony model is comparable to the Samsung for around the same price? I will switch if it's a better value.</Content>
