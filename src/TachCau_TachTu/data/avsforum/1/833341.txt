		<Content>Hi there, I've searched through the threads but I can't seem to get a full of sense of which screens people are using for the Epson 720. I'm looking at picking one up in the next few months and as it is noted as a relative bright projector I was wondering if people are going with white or gray screens. It will be generally used in subdued light and all signs seem to point to me using a gray screen but I was wondering what everyone else was using. Your setup details would greatly be appreciated.</Content>
