		<Content>I need to buy Blu Ray playback software. I don't want any solutions that I need to hack to work. So I've narrowed it down to either PowerDVD 8 or Arcsoft's TotalMedia Theatre. I plan to stream Blu Ray ISO's from my media server to my HTPC, so ISO playback is a must. Which one would you guys choose and why? Thanks in advance.</Content>
