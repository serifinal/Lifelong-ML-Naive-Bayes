		<Content>Major AV Newbie here, and I have a fairly simple question that I need help with before I start purchasing cables that I don't need or that won't work. Please bare with my lack of savviness (terminology) as I try to lay out my situation as simply as possible... Preface: Not only am I poor, but my equipment is all older (2+ years) and low end. Ultimate Goal: To have my PC Media Center deliver sound through my Home Theater (picture already works through 15 pin HD D-Sub). My Question(s): Is there a cable that I can purchase to connect from my PC Media Center's SPDIF Coaxial Out (ORANGE), into my television's available RCA Audio Line In (RED and WHITE), so that when I'm using my VGA input ( 15 pin HD D-Sub (HD-15) for the picture... sound will be delivered from my Media Center? I'm not worried so much about losing sound quality, just don't want to buy anything I don't need. Model #'s (please don't poke fun at my cheap equipment): Television: Insignia NS-42pdp Home Theater: JVC THC5 PC Media Center: HP Pavilion Elite m9077c Current Setup: I thought I'd list everything available, including connections in-use, so that you can offer suggestions for change if needed.
