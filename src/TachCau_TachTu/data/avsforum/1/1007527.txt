		<Content>Ok, here's the deal. Basically, I am having HDCP connectivity issues with my XBOX 360, cheap-o Phillips home theater in a box / upconversion DVD player system and my BenQ PB8240 projector. I have purchased all of this equipment recently and I was trying it out for the first time last night. I currently have it connected via an HDMI to DVI-D cable, coming from the XBOX's HDMI output to the projector's DVI-I input (duh). When I attempted to stream HD content from XBOX live's Netflix service, it displayed an error message. It said: "Secure HDCP link not found". So, I, tried to watch a DVD via the xbox and again it displayed the same error message. I have been playing games on the xbox and they have been working fine. Next, I took the Phillips system out of the box and hooked everything up. The HDMI-DVI cable was unplugged from the XBOX and then plugged in to the HDMI output on the phillips DVD player. I then proceeded to turn the DVD player on and I get no picture, but I do get sound (home theater in a box system, through included speakers). That's when I thought to myself, "hmm, this looks like an HDCP problem!". So, I connected the DVD player to the projector via a regular old RCA cable and of course that worked fine. This is when I was sure it was an HDCP problem. The xbox games were playing fine but then when I tried to view video, that's when things went funny. Reading online, I looked around to confirm that the projector is HDCP compliant, and it appears that it is. So, here is some information; - HDMI-DVI cable = DIRECTV branded no-name DVI-D to HDMI cable - Projector has DVI-I and "RGB signal input, PC/YPbPr/YCbCr" input (which looks to be a 15 pin RGB connector) If you have the time, please review the owners manual at the following link. It contains valuble connection information on pages 12 and 14 of the PDF file. http://www.aboutprojectors.com/pdf/b...240-manual.pdf Now, I'm thinking that the best way to go about resolving this problem would be to completely avoid it by connecting the video source via component cables. On the user manual, it shows that the projector originally came with a cable they are calling the "component video cable". This can be seen on the bottom of page 12 of included PDF file. I got the projector used, and that cable was not included in my purchase. My question to you guys is what exactly would the technical name of this cable be, and where could I go about purchasing one? I have also looked into an HDFURY convertor to assist in the HDCP handshake but simply using component cables seems to be the easiest and least expensive option. Can anyone provide any guidance here? Thanks! EDIT-- Could this be the cable I'm looking for? http://www.monoprice.com/products/pr...seq=1&format=2</Content>
