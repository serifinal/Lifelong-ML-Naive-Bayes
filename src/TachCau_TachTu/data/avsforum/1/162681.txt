		<Content>I'm very sad that my PB12 died... Instead of buying another sub, I was told I should consider building my own.. Can someone link me to a FAQ or something along those lines? I'm hoping to learn the basics so I can decide if I want to build one myself. Also, if you can link to some vendors for amps/subs or recommend some brands I should be considering. Thanks!</Content>
