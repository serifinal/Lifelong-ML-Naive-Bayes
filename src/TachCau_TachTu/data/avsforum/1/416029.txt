		<Content>I'm looking to buy my first Blue-ray player as the supply of HD-DVD rental disks is getting slim. I'm looking for top notch video playback for both BR and DVD because I have a large fp setup (115" 2.35 AR) with a 13' viewing distance. From our seats artifacts and other problems are easy to see so I try to get the best performance at reasonable prices (players costing over $600 are not going to fly with the missus). As far as DVD playback/upscaling, I'd like to see a marked improvement over what I'm getting currently with my Tosh A2 player as I have many favorite movies in my collection that I won't soon be replacing with BR versions. Audio - I also need/want internal decoding of all the latest codecs via the analog outputs because I have an older but very fine non-HDMI Denon 5803 receiver. Those being my requirements, I came up with these three machines as the top candidates. I've been trying to read through each machine's threads but have to admit the thread on the Pio 51/Elite 05 is a very lengthy and intimidating read. Can someone help me out by cutting through all the chatter in these posts and summarize the strengths/weaknesses of the Pio 51 versus the other two ? I've seen some members claim that it has the best video and analog audio, but have seen other posts which say is very slow at handling/loading disks or very slow at layer changes with DVDs. Does the "outstanding" video performance also apply to SD material ? I've read really positive things about the new Panny 55 and it's perhaps my front runner, but I'm willing to listen to arguments for the 51, as I'm willing to pay the price difference between the two if the video and audio performance is that much better. ( I have decent audio playback chain - front channels are fed to a B&K ST140 stereo amp to power a pair of Vandersteen 2Ce's ). I'd also like to think that the larger size of the Pioneer means the engineers needed the space to accomodate things like beefier power supplies, maybe separate power supplies for audio and video sections, separate boards for each, stuff like that. The Panny, on the other hand, is really small and makes me wonder what the designers were or weren't able to fit inside. Thanks. I realize this is turning out to be another help me decide ... thread, but the extreme length of many of the player owner threads is just consuming way too much of my time and often yielding precious little information of value - I'd rather be spending time in my HT watching a movie on blue ray !
