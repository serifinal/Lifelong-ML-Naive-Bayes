		<Content>If you had a choice of U-Verse or Fios, which would you pick and why. Does one have a better long term outlook. I can get Fios right now but don't trust the people trying to sell it to me. My mom lives approx. 15 miles from me and just got U-Verse but she doesn't know what it really does yet. I saw a few HD channels today and looks similar to her Direct TV. I want the best technology but I want something long term. I am happy with my direct tv but video on demand looks interesting. Maybe get Howard TV, etc.</Content>
