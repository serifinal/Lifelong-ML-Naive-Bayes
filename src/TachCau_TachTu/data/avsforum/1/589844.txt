		<Content>Ok guys here is my problem. I've done the research and been to the stores... I don't know the answer and I'm sick of internalizing the conflict anymore so I'm asking.... Room - Living room, 3 casement windows directly opposite TV and 2 windows on the side. Obviously not perfect for a HT, but we live with our situations. Currently a 32inch CRT resides here. Replacement - Plasma or LCD. I like Plasma over LCD for PQ, colors, details etc. However, I'm very concerned about reflection, it does bother me on the current CRT. LCD, I could almost buy an LCD, but currently am so annoyed with the motion blur I see on some of my friend's TVs. And it seems most 120Hz sets are both pricy and glossy, which to me defeats the purpose of the LCD, the glossy part. The TV search started with a 6ave electronics ad with a 50 inch plasma for $1K, which was a last year model, wasn't as impressive as current models.... I've since been impressed with the Samsung A450, which grew into the A550, then there were the PZ80 and PX80 twins calling my name, then the Sony and Samsung LCDs. All in all, I was hoping to spend 1-1500 which has grown to, OK but it HAS to be under 2K and was looking at the 50-52inch size. Anyone got suggestions for my problem, a plasma that doesn't reflect or an LCD without blur that is niether glossy nor pricey? right now, I'm thinking screw it, I'll buy a 720P plasma, live with the reflection and be happy I spent half of a similar TV, if someone doesn't have the answer, cause I'm doing my normal reseach it until I'm so sick of thinking about it that I don't care what i get anymore.</Content>
