		<Content>I figured I would come to the experts and ask this question. I am looking to upgrade my television to either a Samsung LN52A750 or LN52A850. Looking at the spec sheet on them, the only thing that truly sticks out is the width difference. The price difference is about $500 more for the 850 so I wanted to know if there was anything out there that would make it worth that. The 750 looked awesome when I saw it in the store. Help on this would be greatly appreciated!</Content>
