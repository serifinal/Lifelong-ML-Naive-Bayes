		<Content>I am trying to decide between both of these two 32in 720p LCD's. They both seem comparable to each other (except for the fact that the LG comes with a built in DVD player). Any suggestions or advice to push me one way or the other would be appreciated. The reviews on both TV's are excellent so I am trying to find that little extra... to help me decide. Thanks for the help!</Content>
