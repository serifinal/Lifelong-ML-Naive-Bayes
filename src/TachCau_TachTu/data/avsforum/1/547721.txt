		<Content>So, I decided to purchase the Sharp 46? LC-46SB54U LCD HDTV from Dell during the after Thanksgiving sale. They had it listed for $899.00 and I had a $100.00 Dell credit so I go this thing for $799.00. However... The problem I am having with the TV is the detection of the resolution each channel is bring broadcasted in. Let me try to explain it! It down converts just fine. I.e..When I am watching a channel that is 1080i and switch to a challen being broadcasted in 720p the conversion goes just fine but when I switch back to the 1080i channel it does not upconvert back to 1080i and remains in 720p. Frustrating!!!!!!! Does anyone have a similar experience or know of something I may be doing wrong? Any thoughts would be much appreciated. Michael</Content>
