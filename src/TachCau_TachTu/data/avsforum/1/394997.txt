		<Content>Hello everybody, I am the lucky owner of the AAD 7001 who are very excellent monitor speaker. I am thinking of adding a center speaker for HT. But I want to something really nice to suit with the quality of the 7001. The all 3 front speaker will be bi-amp by a LX-90 I am looking at PIEGA TC-40 X and ELAC 601 My front are 8Ohms,I hope there is no problem in using a 4OHm for the center</Content>
