		<Content>Hi, I am looking to finally upgrade my current av setup from a 34" Sony XBR CRT that i have had for the last 5 yrs. I was just about to pull the trigger on a Pioneer Kuro 5020fd after weeks of research when i got an itch to revisit projectors which have always interested me. I have spent a little time researching projectors although still a complete noob and was looking for a little advice. This is a floorplan of my tiny apt As you can see i have quite a few windows and would plan to project the image onto either the large window in the living room or the opposite wall. I have roller shades on all windows which let in 3% light although from what i have read that would seem to be my primary concern. Ceiling height is around 100" and width of room is 12'. My budget is around $2500 and two projectors i am interested in are the: Panasonic PT-AE3000 Mitsubishi HC6500U Both seem to have great reviews however my questions are the following: -What has the better PQ and detail? Above projectors or the kuro? -Will either of the above projectors work well in my apt? Screen size is important although coming from a 34" tv 96" should be more than enough. -Will i be able to adequately view tv during the day or if my gf insists on reading a book in the same room with a light or two on? Not sure how keen she would be about living in a dark room -Any other major advantages/limitations between the technologies (i.e bulb replacement) I would plan to use the projector as my primary viewing device, i.e. 3-4hrs of viewing a day including Bluray, hd cable through my tivo series 3, htpc for movies and web surfing, gaming and anything in between both day and night although i usually do most of my watching at night seeing as im at work paying off my gadget addiction during the day I have never had a projector or a plasma for that matter and have for some reason always thought that i would need a big house with a dedicated cinema in the basement before springing for the projector which i would only use for movie night. Recently however it seems the price and desire for a projector have coincided Would love to know if you guys think i should go with my original choice of the kuro or if a projector is a viable option and if so which one? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.</Content>
