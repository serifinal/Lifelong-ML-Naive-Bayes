		<Content>Well today I'm going to be buying one of these TV's since they are both on sale. Until a few days ago I was completely set on getting the D64 but I'm been really leaning on the Samsung. It's 2'' less but for $200 less I'm willing to go with it if the PQ is better. So which TV is better? Thanks Sharp AQUOS LC42D64U http://www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/prodde...47&catid=24558 or Samsung LN40A550 http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/pro...099946&catid=#</Content>
