		<Content>Can't wait to hear the reviews... I will be buying one or the other - I am pretty sure of that... But, honestly, I hear one buyer saying that he would have NOT BOUGHT a Non-Elite had he known about the lack of Service Menu and some of the other calibration features...so... The question is... Which one are you buying and why?</Content>
