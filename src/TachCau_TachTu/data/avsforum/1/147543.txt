		<Content>"Terminator 2: Judgement Day" is being sold cheap everywhere I see it. I'm very tempted to buy it, but I hesitate because I've heard that the PQ is not very good with the current release. Seeing how prices are so cheap with this title, is it possible Lionsgate is planning a new and improved release? Has anyone heard about an upcoming re-release?</Content>
