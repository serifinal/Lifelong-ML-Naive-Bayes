		<Content>Hey guys I was just looking at this tv on amazon and I am just wondering if this would be a good set for gaming? The 40" model i believe is $1500 on amazon and the specs are 1080p, 120hz, 4ms response, 50,000:1 contrast. If anyone who owns this or knows anything about it please let me know, and my main purpose will be for gaming, thanks.</Content>
