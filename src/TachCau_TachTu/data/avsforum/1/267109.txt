		<Content>Hi I'm a newcomer to the world of large flat panel screens. At first I was determined I should going LCD, with either Samsung or Panasonic at the top of my list. But the more I look at these in various store displays and especially when being fed good BD content, the more I am inclined towards the natural film like look of PLASMA. The Panasonic Viera line seems to offer great value and I am narrowing my choice to either the PX80, PZ80 or PZ85. I a getting the smallest plasma available, the 42". Is the $400 price difference between the PX80 and PZ85 worth it? At an approximately 6-8 ft viewing distance, will I appreciate the extra 1080p that the 85 offers?</Content>
