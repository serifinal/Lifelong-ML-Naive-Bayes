		<Content>Has anybody compared the A650's to the Toshiba XF550 series? I currently have a 32 inch samsung which has done me good the last couple of years and am looking to upgrade to a 46 full 1080p. I have been doing some research and the samsungs seem to be getting alot of problems so I am looking for a backup plan.</Content>
