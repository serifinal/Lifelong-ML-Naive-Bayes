		<Content>I currently have a standard definition Denon 3930ci dvd player hooked to my KDS-R50XBR150" Grand WEGA? SXRD television. I was considering buying a blu-ray player, however my television will only do 1080i. Will I get any benefit if I upgrade from my standard definition (but highly rated) dvd player? Optically, can someone see the difference between a blu-ray hooked to a 1080p television verses a 1080i televison?</Content>
