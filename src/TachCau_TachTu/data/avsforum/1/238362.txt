		<Content>Our 10 year old 29" Magnavox is about to die (it's entered the whacking stage), so we're finally going HD this year. Our plan is a 40+" TV for under $800, bought from a physical local store (really don't want to risk the hassle of shipping back a defective unit). So far we've found a couple candidates, 1080p with HDMI & VGA for $700. We're not really in a hurry, since we're not big TV users (less than basic cable, a couple hours of DVD & Wii per week). So we're wondering if better deals are likely as Xmas approaches. Advice, reviews, other bargains, etc would be appreciated.</Content>
