		<Content>Source I know we all heard that T-Mobile is going to be launching HSPA+ this year, but what really caught my eye about this article was that it said there will definitely be a high end phone coming from T-Mobile before the end of the year. No word on maker, specs, or OS, but it gives me a glimmer of hope that there will be an Android phone that is better than the G1 that has been the leader of T-Mobile's Android pack since its release a year and a half ago.</Content>
