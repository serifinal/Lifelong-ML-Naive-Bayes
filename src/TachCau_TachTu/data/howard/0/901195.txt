		<Content>I know a lot of people are cutting and mutilating, taping, gluing, etc etc. But seriously, stop with the shenanigans. Gizmodo posted about the Microsim-Shop.com, and their adapter. So i ordered 5. Under 20 bucks. I'm giving a few away to friends, and keeping the rest for myself. They fit and work perfectly. Price is great, and shipping is fast. i got mine in about a week, shipped from Austria. http://microsim-shop.com/</Content>
