		<Content>Hi everyone, and let just say I'm new on here and to this extreme phone-tech stuff. I was hoping that someone could help me with getting my old Moto-v551 cingular phone to accept or work with a T-Mobile sim chip. I've already lost time and money on scam sites to no avail. Thanks a whole lot for anything substantial leading to an actual working phone.</Content>
