		<Content>I bought the new Samsung Caliber SCH r860 from Metro PCS and up to day I can't make it communicate with my computer, I have used Btooth and PC studio can't find it. I have used USB and it says "USB device not recognized". I downloaded the new version of PC studio, I downloaded the latest USB drivers, installed everything and still the same, It doesn't work with PC studio. Is there any help out there? Thanks in advance.</Content>
