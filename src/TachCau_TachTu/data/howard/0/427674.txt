		<Content>Hi All, I'm on Rogers Pay-As-You-Go with a 125/mo text package (with a balance of about 100 left, and some money left in the monthly balance expiring in January). As it is, I can send texts to people no problem. But receiving is a very different story. When some people (some on 711 speakout, others on Rogers monthly) send my texts, they don't get a delivery report and I don't get the message until very much later, when I get all the messages I was sent together at once. This has happened multiple times. Does anyone know whats going on? Thanks!</Content>
