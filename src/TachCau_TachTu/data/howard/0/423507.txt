		<Content>instead of making a cable why doesn't somebody just make like a small adapter that would be flush with the bottom of the phone with the 3.5mm port on the side? It would only add maybe half of a centimeter in length and it could stay there... edit: kind of like this, but extend the full length of the phone and have another usb port on the bottom</Content>
