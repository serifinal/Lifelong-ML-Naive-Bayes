		<Content>I saw this on VM's webiste (http://www.virginmobileusa.com/mobil...text-messaging) International Text Send and receive text messages with people on select carriers in over 170 countries worldwide. To send an international text, enter 011 + the country code + the mobile number. Simple as that. Available on: All Virgin Mobile Phones Does anyone know what are those 170 countries and what are those SELECT carriers ?</Content>
