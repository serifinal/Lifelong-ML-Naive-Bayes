		<Content>Call me at 1-416-669-9111 or PM me to reach my Blackberry instantly. Received through Rogers retentions yesterday however I already have a phone so this one is up for sale. Proof of purchase will be supplied to you for a full 1-yr warranty. If this ad is still here the phone is still available. Willing to meet anywhere in Richmond Hill/Markham/Newmarket area or Downtown if during the week. Still sealed in box: Happy shopping!</Content>
