		<Content>Everytime I read a post from Graham I want to scream. Wind is really turning out to be WORSE than the big 3.... In response to a post today on the Wind comments forum about continued port blocking and no SIP access this was posted ! " @droidhacker Thank you for your post. Chris wrote a blog a few weeks ago that addressed what we are currently prepared to do when it comes to ports. http://www.windmobile.ca/community/W...ata-ports-fix/ Although I realize this will not satisfy your request to open up all ports, Chris lists some reasons why ports might remain closed. I can tell you that streaming and tethering on the Blackberry is currently in the process of being tested. We hope to have some good news on this front in the next 30 days. Again I realize this is not the news you want to hear, but the changes Chris listed in his post opened up the ports that the vast majority of our customers use. I will forward your post to the right people to ensure we consider all of our customer needs in our plans. thank you again for your post Graham" so basically Wind is saying F u, that's all the ports we are ever going to open, and oh BTW it will take another month to fix Blackberry tethering....WTF are they doing over there - man I feel bad for you Blackberry users How do we all give Wind the message ? Leaving for Dave? It's almost like they don't give a **** about us early adopters, we are the guinea pigs that they can use to test their network while they expand nation wide, guinea pigs who are paying them to work for them...what a great deal for Wind, and hey if 75% of us leave when they finally roll out nationwide with a reiable network they can just blitz the media again to get new customers</Content>
