		<Content>Hi all, I'll appreciate some advice on how to deal with the issue of not being able to send emails. I have a Nokia N900 and voice/data plan with Wind Mobile. I have been successfully able to retrieve email messages from my Telus email account both via wi-fi and now on cellular data. But I can't send emails, no matter what I tried for outgoing server setting. Telus email account is not mobile, it is what comes with my home internet. Any advice/help will be much appreciated!</Content>
