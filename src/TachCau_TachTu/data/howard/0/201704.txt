		<Content>Hey all; Just decided to d/l this programme right now and find it allows for great remote access to phone functions; 1)Send and receive SMS/TXT from your computer without picking up your phone (threaded by conversation) 2)Automatically upload photos and videos captured on the go to easily organize and share with your friends 3)Add an address book contact on your computer and have it instantly appear on your phone 4)Easily set Internet favorites, ringtones, wallpapers, and speed dials ? in seconds from your computer 5)Single click media upload to Facebook, Flickr, FriendFeed, Twitter & Bebo 6)Update your status on Facebook & Twitter 7)Visual voicemail on your computer (or as i call it, Power VVM) I dont usually try these progs until i read more about in on HoFo but this time I couldnt resist; You control which items sync and when it happens. Dashwire connects across wireless data, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB. Simple registration process, 1.cab file onto phone memory (would prefer external memory but hey..), 2.register with minimum details (email, phone, and password) 3.run the 1st sync 4.modify privacy seting,s sync options, etc etc 5.enjoy..!! Links http://dashwire.com/ direct link from phone; http://m.dashwire.com/ Although you have the option of manual or auto sync options; this does require huge data transfers back n forth so adapt your data plans (or data use accordingly) or only use in a wifi zone. NB: Presently this prog runs on WM5 & WM6 & SYMBIAN OS (symbian in private beta), upcoming versions according to the site will run on Android, BB, and Sybian S60 3rd edition too...
