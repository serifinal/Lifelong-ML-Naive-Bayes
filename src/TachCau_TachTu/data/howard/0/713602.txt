		<Content>Use this thread to post the software version and date code of your Droid X. The X should come with firmware 1.13.516 but there is an over-the-air-update that (should) update it to .604 firmware. If it doesn't update you might want to try a factory reset, then have it check for the update You guys can post the date code on the back label if it differs from 25/10 (week/year).</Content>
