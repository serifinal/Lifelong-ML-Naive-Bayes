		<Content>Selling a practically brand new Google Nexus one phone, this is the AT&T Rogers 3G version. Had the phone for about a week, the moment I took the phone out of the box a screen protector was put onto it with a Nexus One case mate case on it. I still have the receipt for the phone if anyone would like it, the manuals, headset, and USB cable is still sealed inside the phone. Only accessory opened is the charger. So this is the package. Phone has the latest 2.1+ Factory software, and factory unlocked. -Nexus one with screen protector 3G Rogers Version -Box -Headset(Sealed) -Android Soft Sleeve(Sealed) -USB Cable(Sealed) -Manuals(Sealed) -Wall Charger -Case mate silicon case -4GB memory Card The entire package is $600. PRICE IS FIRM. *No Trades* Do not send me offers with trades, or low ballers, I will delete them with no reply back. I'm located in Brampton, pick up only. I sometimes can meet in Sauga or Yorkdale mall. If interested please e-mail me at nafhoque@gmail.com, I will reply back ASAP Thanks for your interest and your time</Content>
