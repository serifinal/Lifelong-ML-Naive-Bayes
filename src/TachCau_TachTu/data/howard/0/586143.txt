		<Content>ok my girls caliber is stuck on loop. Samsung screen comes up loads up and then restarts. Hoping to figure out someway to reflash the software / firmware to the phone. googles / searched for info on this and couldnt find any. i figured out how to put it in download mode which i couldnt find that anywhere either. Download emergency mode - Press the TTY button, Volume down button, and Home / center button, and the power button to load into this mode.</Content>
