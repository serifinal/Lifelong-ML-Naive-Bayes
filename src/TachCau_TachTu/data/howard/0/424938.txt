		<Content>I am on 3.5G and I am not able to connect to T-Mobile's internet connection. I am currently at school(Montgomery College Germantown) and can not connect but my phone is telling me I am on 3.5G. What's going on? Can anyone help? Anyone else having this problem? It was working fine last night.</Content>
