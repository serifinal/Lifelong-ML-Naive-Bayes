		<Content>I have for sale a brand new, unlocked Google Nexus One for AT&T, Rogers, etc. This device was opened, rooted and flashed and then put for sale. Not a single scratch, ding, dent or anything else wrong with it. It comes with all original accessories (a/c adapter, data cable, pouch, battery) as well as original box and documentation. Original sales receipt available upon request. I will sell for $599 USD shipped in the US or Canada. Link to the photo gallery Here. PM me with any questions. You can view my feedback HERE. Thanks!</Content>
