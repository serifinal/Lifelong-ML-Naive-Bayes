		<Content>Earlier this week my wife and I had two separate business trips in Seattle. One for her (company asked her to informally go out/get to know and meet the company/execs/people who her company had hired to market one of the property developments back in Vancouver) Myself...go and find more distributors for my small I.T. Business. So...we decided to do both in one trip. Now originally, I had wanted to photograph my odometer starting from the Canadian side of the border and monitor while driving south. Unfortunately...we left in the evening, it was dark and raining plus...I left my damn camera in my laptop bag stuffed deep in the trunk. So...instead I will be showing my results coming back to the Canadian border. 1. On our way back from Seattle...we stopped at Bellisfair Mall (Bellingham) to have dinner at the infamous OLD COUNTRY BUFFET! From here my phone was roaming on EVDO (there is a small triangle icon above the clock) and please take note that I'll start this at roughly 90.7 KMs 2. As you can see...we are still quite aways from the border. Please keep in mind that it's in Miles 'cause we're still in the U.S. 3. The picture below now shows that my phone is NO LONGER roaming but in 1X mode. The small roaming triangle icon has disappeared. That's roughly 5.2 KMS since it was originally roaming. I'm still in the U.S. but again...I am no longer roaming. 4. Roughly at 109.8 KMS (still in the U.S.) my phone reverts back to EVDO and continues to not roam. 5. Slowly heading into the border 6. So...just moments before I approach the border, I take one last snapshot of the odometer. It's now at 110.7 KMs So if we do the math...Telus Signal right at the border (EVDO or CDMA1X) was at 110.7 KMs. Telus signal continues right up to 95.9 KMs because earlier before that mark, I was roaming with Verizon (EVDO and CDMA1X) 110.7 - 95.9 = 14.8 KMs! My unofficial but real world data shows that I did not actually roam until roughly/approximately 14.8 KMs past the U.S. Border. To me...that's quite good if you live near the B.C./WA border. This is what I meant by the buffering agreement with Verizon back a few years ago because my friends and family from the U.S. pretty much experience the same heading into Canada. I mentioned this in the other Border Thread that was closed. Hope this helps those who are seeking this kind of info. Pictures tell a thousand words when one is trying to show real world facts/data!</Content>
