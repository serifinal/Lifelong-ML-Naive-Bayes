		<Content>Hi, In our next trip to Europe I want to use my (soon to be purchased) Nokia 5730 as a backup for my pictures. I have SD and SDHC cards that I'd like to copy from 2 Canon and 1 Casio cameras to the 16GB SDHC memory inside the 5730. I supose the 5730 doesn't have an USB host mode but is there a way to copy the pictures without using a computer ? Thanks in advance ! Christian.</Content>
