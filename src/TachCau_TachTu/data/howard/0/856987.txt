		<Content>I'm on T-Mobile USA, iPhone 3GS, using the MMS hack allowing me to send and receive MMS. For some reason, when I want to send a group sms, once I add a second person in the Messaging app, it automatically says "Group MMS" at the top. When I send them, the other people receive the message as a MMS. Is this a known bug with 3.0 or an issue if you are using the MMS hack? Anyone have this happen? Thanks</Content>
