		<Content>At first, I thought my reception problems were a product of the ROMs that I was installing onto my phone. That doesn't appear to be the case anymore. I noticed that when I put the phone down and don't touch it, the reception bars will typically always show three or four. When I pick the phone back up, I see them drop to one or two. It's a weird and frustrating problem. Has anyone else endured this?</Content>
