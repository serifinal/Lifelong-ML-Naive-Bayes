		<Content>anyone have a solution for this? ive searched around but i havent brought up anything to fix the issue. i flashed my phone over to cricket and they said i wouldnt be able to get the internet or mms but i was searching and found a post to go in and changed your outbound recieving numbers via yournumber@mycricket.com and i did that, which is why i think im getting the mms's now but i cant for the life of me figure out the internet i have all the programs already downloaded that i will need if anyone is willing to help me, i was talking to another user about a week ago and he said i needed to add a port so my phone is picked up when i plug it in so the QPST would pick it up and allow me to change the settings but i havent heard back from him thanks in advance</Content>
