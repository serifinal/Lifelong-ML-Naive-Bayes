		<Content>Since about a week or so, I have noticed that when I am in a call, i no longer am able to access the 3G or Edge networks on rogers and fido. I have read and searched but i have not found anything. I have contacted rogers and they reset my phone thinking it was a software issue..It has also happening on FIDO network. Is this happening to anyone else?</Content>
