		<Content>When can we expect the update?? ---------------------------- EDIT Updated Originally Posted by Humpa http://support.vzw.com/pdf/system_update/moto_droid.pdf Thanks to Indohan for posting that link in the 2.1 pre-release thread. It looks like the ESE53 that was leaked is the actuall Droid update to 2.1. I assume they removed the adb root (development root), but the number is the same as I already have on my ESE53 Droid (C_01.3E.03P). So we're done here - now we can start threads about froyo.</Content>
