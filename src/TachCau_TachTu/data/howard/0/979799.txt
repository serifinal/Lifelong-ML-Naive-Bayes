		<Content>This is completely brand new in box; I haven't even opened the package (very tempted to though...) Asking $640 CAD firm, local pick up in downtown Toronto only. I will open this up in front of you so you can see it's 100% BNIB. All original receipt and accessories will be included of course. However, I do need to keep the SIM card, so if the SIM card is already inside the phone, you'll need to let me take that out. Thanks,</Content>
