		<Content>Anyone interested in trading their BNIB Rogers iPhone 3Gs 16GB for a BNIB Rogers 9700 Bold? Your 16GB iPhone 3Gs must be brand new sealed, and it must be from Rogers. Proof of activation must be shown with matching IMEI as I will provide the same for my 9700. If you have a Rogers 32GB 3Gs, it must be in absolutely MINT condition (I'm very meticulous), and with a good length of warranty remaining on the phone. I prefer black iPhones. No Fido iPhones. Face-to-Face transaction only! I'm located in Scarborough. Cheers.</Content>
