		<Content>I activated a AX260 rumor for a friend and the internet wont work i get this error error: requested content homepage/' cannot be accessed Its not a phone issue because when i move my number to the phone the internet works, When i called Page Plus (im a dealer) they said it must be a number issue since my number the web works but the other number the web doesnt work. Anyone seen this error and know how to fix it?</Content>
