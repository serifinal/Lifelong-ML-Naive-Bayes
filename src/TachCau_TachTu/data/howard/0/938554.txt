		<Content>Take it for what its worth, but this is NOT hear-say. I guess only time will prove.... A Moto tech is a regular customer of mines, I'm a bartender. Noticed his device & caught my attention. Little did I know...would be blown away. I played around with it (reference to #2 below). Had the "confidential blah blah" engraved on the side. Cannot share pics. Here is some "info" Next BIG Android software update "Froyo" (forgot how its spelled) will bring 3D App drawer to Droid (still in process & tentative) Moto just signed a deal to use new chips with a computer chip manufacture, NVIDIA to make future chips for future devices 1. "Droid 2" This is already in works 1gHz processor Same basic design, bottom is more curved/beveled, but BETTER keyboard. 2. Unknown name as of now (forgot to take off the battery cover) 4.3" Screen (not AMOLED) 8MP Cam Odd but so far not planned for 1gHz processor. This one had a 770 mHz Moto Blur 2.1 HDMI output Records @ 720p Physical buttons in front (like HTC HD2) The "camera button" (physical) is metallic red like HTC has been doing. Yes, its Verizon as it has the Verizon branding on it Its final build stages. Software still not final revision. Very slick design & thin. The back is thin from bottom then when it gets towards top of phone, it buldges up to a thicker part (hard to describe) To me, its the answer to HTC Evo I wanted the Evo & planned on going to Spring...but now, I will be waiting for this gem because I've been with BigRed for 10 years (I'm 26). Yes I know, no 4G/LTE. He told me slated for Father's Day release.... Few ANSWERS to question I know may arise within this thread: NO, I was not drunk NO, he was not drunk YES, I know I should've gotten him drunk so he could've "dropped" this device (alas iPhone G4) NO, I cannot share pics NO, this was not a strip club YES, I'm 100% it was not HTC Evo nor HD2. YES, verizon branded on top of screen & Moto logo on back (didn't have "Google" anywhere on it) Yes, I'm sure it was MotoBLUR (2.1) NO, its nothing that's been leaked on the net....yet...[pause] NO, it is NOT a device from overseas. Again, VERIZON branded. What's the point of this with no pics? 1. Someone will appreciate this for something to look forward to. 2. Some "eyes" snooping here know EXACTLY which device I played with.
