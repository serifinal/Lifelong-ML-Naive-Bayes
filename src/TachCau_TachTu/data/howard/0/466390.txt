		<Content>I was looking though my call records on the PP website. On Dec 9, there is a 1 min call to my phone that I got charged for. At that particular time, my phone was off and in my pocket. I didn't have any "missed calls" and it's highly unlikely anyone called me since only two people had my number at that particular point in time. Can anyone tell me why I got charged for a call I didn't make or receive?</Content>
