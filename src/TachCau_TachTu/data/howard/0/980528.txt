		<Content>I'm selling this factory-unlocked black 16GB iPhone since I've upgraded to the 3GS. I'm going to try a few forums and Craigslist first, and will go to eBay only if I need to. A kind co-worker with family in New Zealand bought this for me last October and shipped it to me brand new. It has had a case and/or DecalGirl skin on it since day 1, as well as an anti-glare screen protector. I have the box and all accessories ? the power adapter and USB cord are brand new and have never been used, while the headphones will be used, albeit gently. The power adapter is for New Zealand, so a buyer in another location will need to get one for their own country or just charge it via USB with the included cable. It is in excellent condition showing only minor wear on the chrome bezel and a few marks on the back (ironically from my Incase Slider) and has never been dropped or abused. The screen is flawless. I have had no problems with it whatsoever. Again, this is a factory unlocked version, and it has and will remain unlocked through any firmware update from Apple. I have used it successfully with local SIM cards while traveling abroad in Europe. It is currently running the 3.1 firmware. Apple's site states that it's under warranty until October 19, 2009, though Apple may decline to provide service for it outside of New Zealand where it was sold. More pictures are available - I can email high-res ones if you PM me your email address. No trades, PayPal only. Asking $450, shipping included for buyers in the U.S. only. I want to clear $450 after PayPal fees, so please keep this in mind, particularly if you are outside of the U.S. and will be paying with funds that will need to be converted to USD and therefore subject to additional PayPal fees. If you're local to the Boston area, I am also willing to meet in person for the transaction and will accept cash in this case. My eBay ID is mneckles and I have 100% positive feedback (member since 2001) and my heatware ID is r6girl.</Content>
