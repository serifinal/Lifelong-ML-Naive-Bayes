		<Content>When I bought my Nokia e71x with the 450 minutes and PDA personal plan I was told that I would not be able to send or receive text messages unless I also purchased a texting plan so I bought one (200 texts for $5.00). Would I be able to drop the the texting package and just pay-per-text or do I really have to have one?. - Steve</Content>
