		<Title>Bell Network Issues. And They Are Refusing to Support CDMA Technical Issues</Title>

		<Content>I have been fighting with Bell about a network issue in my community since July. I called 3 times throughout the summer and was simply told to do a battery pull or take my phone in for repair. The thing is, it's not just my phone. My Boyfriend has a Blackberry World and I have a Blackberry Pearl (which I bought outright 11 months ago) and we are both having the same problem with dropped calls. The weird thing is, we got perfect service for over a year after moving into the house, then it shut off like someone flicked a switch in July 2009. I will have 4 bars of service, someone calls and nearly every time it drops the call. Currently, I have about a 90% dropped call rate when I'm at home on our property. Other CDMA customers have had this same problem as well elsewhere in the community. I finally succeeded last month in getting someone to listen to me. This person put in a trouble ticket, escalated it, and even identified a tower that seems to be having issues with dropped calls. I got a call back on the trouble ticket at the end of October simply saying "We see that there's a problem with the tower, but hang tight, the HSPA network is coming and let's see if that helps anything. If not, call back". The HSPA network is now here. I still drop calls. I called back today. They looked at my ticket, listened to the issues, and even went through all of my dropped calls and could see they're all on this tower. Know what their answer was? "I'm sorry, we aren't taking any more trouble tickets for the CDMA network. Because this is only in your area, we are unable to help. We are now concentrating on the new HSPA network." Like....really? Seriously? You are no longer supporting the network that like at least 80% of your customers are still on? Their solution is that I went out and buy a brand new HSPA compatible Blackberry, and to talk to the store or retentions and see if they'll give me a deal on it. My contract is up at the end of December. I told them I'm not inclined to sign another 3 year contract with them, and they mention that I can buy the phone without a contract. Yeah, for $600 I can! So I have to spend $600 with them to get the service I should have with my current phone (which I purchased for $500 11 months ago with the expectation of it working). They refuse to escalate the problem any further. They refuse to let me talk to anyone higher up. It has gone through the first level call centre, to tech support, to their help desk, and that's where I am stuck. What really sucks though is my boyfriend needs a world edition phone for work, and will be buying a Tour 2 when it comes out. The Tour uses the CDMA network when he's home, so he can no longer talk to his customers on his corporate phone (which the company has like 20,000 numbers with Bell) when he's home (where he has a home office) because Bell won't support the old network. Basically, he's out of luck. I am here because you all are knowledgeable in the area of cell service and dealing with service providers. What should my next step be? Rogers doesn't offer a suitable plan without signing a 3 year contract. So aside from the obvious option of switching carriers (I have been looking at my options with Telus), what other courses of action could I take? I would like to have this problem remedied, if anything, for my boyfriend's sake so he can use his phone to talk to his customers.</Content>
