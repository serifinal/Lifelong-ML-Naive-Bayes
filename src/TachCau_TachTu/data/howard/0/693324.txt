		<Content>Is there a new proxy server required for internet over metropcs? I tried tethering today and got a message that the proxy server is "busy or unavailable". I tried looking for wap.metropcs.net on my desktop and found that there is no DNS entry for it. Internet on the dinky little phone still works, so I tend to conclude that the proxy server is no longer wap.metropcs.net port 3128.</Content>
