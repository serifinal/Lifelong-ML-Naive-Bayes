		<Content>Anyone know how to setup the outgoing mail server for WIND? I setup my Shaw email on my Google Ion, and it didn't like any combination of Shaw SMTP server information. So, I randomly put smtp.windmobile.ca and it seemed to work. However, when I send an email it doesn't. Anyone have any luck with this?</Content>
