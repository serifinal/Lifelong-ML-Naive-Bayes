		<Content>I am stoked about my INC. The Android System, Sense, and even the phone quality are excellent. My only problem is the screen size. I just came from taking a close look at the HD2. The screen! I want that screen! That leads me to the EVO. Who knows when the Shadow really will be released and even then, it lacks Sense. Here is my question: The Sprint rep tells me that when roaming they use Verizons towers?? That should make coverage as good (or better?) than Verizon. My home looks to be in a roaming area. Any info on this would be of great help. Thanks!</Content>
