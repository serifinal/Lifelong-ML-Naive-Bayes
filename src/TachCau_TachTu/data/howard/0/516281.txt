		<Content>Guys, I have a Google Nexus One for sale that has the AT&T 3G bands. It comes with the original box and accessories. The phone has an invisible shield on the front. There is a scuff mark on the back side of the phone on the lower left corner and a very very small scuff on the bottom right corner of the phone. The phone works perfectly otherwise. I ship to the US only and don't take trades. I take Paypal payments. I will be willing to sell this for $425 shipped due to the small scuffs. The phone is sold as is and there are no returns. Please PM me if interested. Thanks, Y2J</Content>
