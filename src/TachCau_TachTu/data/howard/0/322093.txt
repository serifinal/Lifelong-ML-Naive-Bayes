		<Content>I was wondering if anyone else is having the same problem. It started about 2 weeks ago. I run AppStore updates on my iPhone and I find let say there is one app that needs to be updated. I download and install the update and run AppStore updates again just to find out that it is still showing that the same application is still in need to be updated. No matter how many times I do it, it still shows in the available updates. I verified that after the first update the application did actually update and is running the latest version. The bug happened only with certain apps: Betterlists, CardStar, PandoraBox, Virtuoso piano free. The same problem happened also on my PC's iTunes with the same applications so I don't think the problem is in the phone itself. I could be either within appstore or the applications themselves I emailed AppStore support and they said it is not their problem. I asked them to forward it to the right support department and all I get back is the same prewritten statement that this is not their problem. I called iPhone tech support and they were going to charge me a fee for the call (I'm out of the 90 days free support) but they gave me a one time courtesy free support. They said the problem is within the applications not sending to the appstore the correct version info after updates. they said the only way to correct that would be to delete the application and reinstall it fresh. I did that and it worked for 3 of the 4 apps in question (except for Pandorabox), but that way I lost all the personal info on the app and I needed to enter everything from scratch... pain in the neck. I contacted the applications authors and they said that the problem is not in their applications and it must be an AppStore problem. So go figure. Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks.</Content>
