		<Content>I've been with Telus since the clearnet days and had (up until now) always understood my long distance minutes to be separate from my local minutes. This month I managed to use up my 100 local minutes, but thought I was safe to still make some long distance calls only to discover them being charged as overages. A call to Telus clarified that if you make a call during the daytime, they take that airtime out of both your long distance AND local minutes. Was this supposed to be common knowledge? Am I the only one who thinks the advertising suggests two pools of minutes?</Content>
