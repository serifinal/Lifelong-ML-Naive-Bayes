		<Content>I just noticed what I think is a bug in 3.0 on the 3GS. I have MMS enabled on my phone which works just great. But I just noticed that now when I send a group SMS it sends it as a group MMS. That really puts a hamper on other iPhone people I send in that group SMS who don't have MMS installed. Is there a setting I am missing, or did I find a bug?</Content>
