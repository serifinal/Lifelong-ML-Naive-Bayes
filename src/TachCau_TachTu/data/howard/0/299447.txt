		<Content>Does anyone know the proper way to do this? I connected a cable from one of the four ports on the W35 Hub to the WAN port of my router. Then i connected that router to a computer. The routers setup page shows the Turbo Hub is connected but I can't get internet access? Any help would be great.</Content>
