		<Content>Okay, so I went through the trouble of getting a Nexus One to Calgary, switched over to Wind, and now my data won't work. I've entered internet.windmobile.ca as the APN. I've even tried accessing the "special" menu typing *#*#4363#*#* and changing the preferred network type to WCDMA only but what I get in each case is a few seconds of 3G connectivity through the browser then lose it almost right away (lose all data connectivity). I was at the Wind Mobile store and they said their techs wouldn't even look at the issue because: 1. They have bigger issues to deal with 2. The Nexus One is not a "support" phone Any suggestions? Being a guinea pig sucks.</Content>
