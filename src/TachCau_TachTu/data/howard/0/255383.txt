		<Content>Hi all, I finally got a Galaxy S Vibrant from Bell, free at Costco (150$ - 100$ in stores rebates - 50$ on my bill because i have 3 services with Bell) + i got the student plans for 50$. I call CSR yesterday to add Mobile Sports TV but was unable to use it, said it's not compatible with my profile. I call technical support and they said because Mobile Sports TV is not compatible with my phones, so i remove it. Anyone here have an idea when it will be compatible ?</Content>
