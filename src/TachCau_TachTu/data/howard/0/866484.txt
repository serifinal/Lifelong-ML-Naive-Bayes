		<Content>I've got a SERO $30 plan that expires on May. Ideally I'd like to cancel it and port my number to Verizon. However that would get me a $200 ETF (according to retentions). Is there any way I can take my number with my to Verizon, and keep the SERO plan active for the rest of the contract with another number or do a swap/give away the remainder of the account to someone and get a new number for them?</Content>
