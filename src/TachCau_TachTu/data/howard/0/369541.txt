		<Content>Has anybody gotten a weird bug where you're in an app or something in iOS 4.0 and you hear the sound that plays for a text message, but you don't get any indication at all about the text? No little pop-up or new text in the Messages app? I just got this error this morning while I was playing Tetris and still after a few hours haven't received this phantom text on my iPhone 3G.</Content>
