		<Content>I have a Sprint Blackberry 8830 WE that I flashed over to Cricket yesterday. I am able to make calls and send SMS text messages. I am not able to access the Internet or send MMS messages. Whenever I try to access the Internet, I recieve an error message. "Unable to connect to the Internet, please try again later. If the problem persists please contact your service provider". I'm not sure where I'm going wrong here. I have been reading tons of forums ALL DAY. I have made sure that the MDN, MSI_S, and SIP User ID are correct. I have downloaded several different Cricket Service Books and applied them. Nothing seems to work. I called Cricket twice today and asked them to refresh my account. Here are the steps I took today. I used UNI_CDMA to figure out my SPC #. I used QPST to reset my SPC to 000000. I used CrackUtil to remove net_rim_bb_prl_upgrade.cod I used QPST to transfer the Cricket PRL file. (ive tried several different prl's) I took the phone to Cricket and had them active it, with mobile web. I used CrackUtil to remove net_rim_bb_browser_daemon.cod. I used Alt + {S}{B}{E}{B} to enable legacy service books. I used Blackberry Manager to transfer Cricket.ipd service book. Rebooted. I used CrackUtil to restore net_rim_bb_browser_daemon.cod. I selected Register Now in the Hosting Routing Table. Rebooted. Nothing appears when I register now under Routing Table. I am still getting "Unable to connect to the Internet, please try again later. If the problem persists please contact your service provider". I have searched these forums high and low for a fix. If anyone has any ideas I'd be glad to try them. Thanks</Content>
