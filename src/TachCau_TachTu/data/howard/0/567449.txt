		<Title>The *Official* 5 GB Data Usage "Soft Cap" Discussion Thread!</Title>

		<Content>This is a topic I've been needing to discuss for a few weeks now, and despite the fact that it gets mentioned in various threads, I was quite surprised to find out that it does not have a dedicated thread of its own! Thus, I am starting one. The purpose of this thread is to discuss CricKet's data usage "soft cap", which is currently set at 5 GB. If you are using a CricKet 3G wireless broadband modem, or a 3G phone used as a tethered modem, and are unfortunate enough to use more than 5 GB in a one month (30 day) period, CricKet can and WILL throttle your download speed SEVERELY! Instead of the zippy DSL-style speeds you normally enjoy, you will be given soul-crushing, internet crippling speeds in the 100 kbps range! Worse still is how they implement this policy in regards to how long you have to put up with these crippled speeds! Back around the beginning of October, I had to download a few fairly large files, and I exceeded 5 GB of usage. CricKet wasted no time in throttling my speeds to a snail's pace. Most carriers, on a policy like this, would reset your "usage meter", and thus your speed, at the start of the next billing period. Since my billing period starts over on the 15th of the month, I put up with these dog a$$ slow speeds for about 2 weeks, waiting patiently for the 15th to arrive. And when it did... nothing. I was STILL experiencing horribly crippled speeds!!! So, I called Customer Service... and that's when the other shoe dropped. That's when I discovered the dirty secret to CricKet's implementation of this policy: They DON'T enforce it based on your billing cycles. According to the CS guy I got, it's based on a ROLLING 30-DAY CYCLE. What does that mean? If they look at the last 30 days of usage, from today back, and see over 5 GB of usage, you get the crippled speeds! Doesn't matter how long ago you exceeded 5 GB, that doesn't count with them. So, after what feels like forever, I STILL don't have my full speed, the speed I pay 40 hard-earned dollars a month for, back!!! IF I WANTED TO BE STUCK WITH EDGE SPEEDS, I WOULD HAVE KEPT USING MY EDGE BLACKBERRY AS A TETHERED MODEM!!! Next month, T-Mobile is FINALLY releasing their long-overdue 3G BlackBerry. I won't be eligible for upgrade until January, though. But when January comes around, if I'm STILL having to put up with this 100 kbps crippled speed BS, I'm dropping CricKet like a bad habit and just using the 3G BlackBerry as a tethered modem! At least T-Mobile's smart phone plans have a 10 GB "soft cap", instead of this idiotic 5 GB crap that all the carriers pull on their air cards! And yes, I know there's now a $60 a month, 10 GB plan for "heavy" users. But I came to CricKet because I did NOT want to pay $60 a month for wireless broadband service! If I'd wanted to pay that much, I would have gone with one of the Big 4 for my 3G service! So, anyone else care to share their thoughts on this data usage "soft cap"? Care to share your horror stories about your own encounters with it? Care to share a dealer's perspective on it? Well, the thread is now open for your comments. I await your replies.</Content>
