		<Content>ok, it's great news that unlocked iPhone 4 will be available through Apple Canada. Both the iPhone 4 and the iPad use the smaller form-factor microSIM cards, but I notice on their website, in the FAQ section there is the following: "Are iPhone 4 and iPad micro-SIM cards interchangeable? No. Your iPad micro-SIM card will not work with your iPhone." what's the reason for this?</Content>
