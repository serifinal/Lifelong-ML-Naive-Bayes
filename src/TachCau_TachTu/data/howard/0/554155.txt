		<Content>Hi I have an iphone 3gs, 16gb, black, and locked to bell. It can be unlocked using free software online. No major scratches, dents, etc.. It looks brand new. Pictures posted below. Comes with everything in the box, including the box, and a switcheasy Vulcan case ($20 value). Firmware is 3.1.3. I'm asking $600 o.b.o. Pm if you have any questions. Only face to face deals in the gta, so that means I won't ship the phone. Thanks, Phu.</Content>
