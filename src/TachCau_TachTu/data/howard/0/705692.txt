		<Content>I use Outlook 2007 Business Contact Manager (BCM) to track contacts, vendors and related e-mails. I must be able to link e-mails to a specific client/contact. Which brand of smartphone offers the easiest syncing between BCM on my computer and the smartphone. So far I'm finding "can't do that but here's a workaround". Does anyone use BCM and have a smartphone they're happy with with reasonable sync? Thanks</Content>
