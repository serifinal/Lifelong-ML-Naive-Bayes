		<Content>Item: Unlocked Telus Motorola Milestone Black Price (and Currency): $600cdn or best offer Condition: Used but LNIB - 9.5/10 Accessories included: * Motorola Milestone phone * Li-ion battery (installed in the phone) * USB cable * AC Adapter * Stereo headset * 16GB memory card * Original Telus Motorola Milestone box Additional details: This item is a used but LNIB Telus Motorola Milestone world phone. It was purchased on February 17th at the Telus Store at Bayview Village. It is the North American version (NAM) with US 3G. It is fully unlocked & partially rooted (it is running the Brazilian firmware 2.0.1. It can run apps that require root access, however, the bootloader is still locked so you can do everything except for overclocking and installing custom ROMs). It supports 3G + GSM on Fido, Rogers and AT&T Wireless, and GSM only on T-Mobile. It also works on Telus and Bell's new HSPA network. It can be used on any 850/1900/2100 3G/HSPA network, as well as any GSM network in the world. As you can see by the pictures, this phone is in pristine condition and has no visible dents, dings or scratches. It has been protected with a high quality anti-glare screen protector ever since day one. Location: GTA (Bayview & Sheppard area) Notes: My asking price is $600cdn or best offer. This phone is being offered on a first-come, first-served basis. If you act quickly, you'll end up getting this phone at a great price. My contact information and PayPal email address (if applicable) will be provided to the winning buyer. I prefer local pickups in the GTA, and can arrange to meet the buyer at the Bayview Village Shopping Centre at a mutually agreed upon date & time. I'm also willing to ship this item (via UPS Express Saver) to anywhere in Canada and the continental United States. Shipping quotes will vary based on your location. If you'd like a shipping quote, please send me your postal/zip code. In order to qualify for shipping, you must have good feedback on HoFo, a verified PayPal account and a PayPal confirmed address. The item will be shipped out to your PayPal confirmed address after full payment is received and the PayPal funds have cleared to my account. I usually ship my items the same business day, provided that I receive a cleared PayPal payment before 2pm (Eastern Daylight Time). In the rare and unlikely event that I am unable to verify a PayPal payment, or if the received funds have not cleared to my account within 24 hours, I reserve the right to cancel the transaction, issue a full refund, and offer this item to another qualified buyer. For local pickups, I will only accept cash (bills in the $50 denomination or less). If I'm shipping this item, I will only accept PayPal. No exceptions. I reserve the right to refuse any offers and/or cancel our sale if you do not agree to the local pickup or shipping terms. PM is key. Established HoFo members with good feedback will receive priority. Low ballers will be ignored. Thank you and good luck!</Content>
