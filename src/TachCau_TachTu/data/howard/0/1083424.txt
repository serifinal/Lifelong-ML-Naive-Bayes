		<Content>I have a brand new unlocked Apple IPhone 3Gs 16Gb (black) still in the box. I don't know what's included inside because I haven't opened it before still! It will come with everything that's in the box. This is factory unlocked, hong kong version!! Asking Price: $700CAD or $700CAD + shipping if not local. I can meet up during weekends pretty much anywhere in the GTA. I can send pictures if necessary. Pls email me at <michael_chan@live.ca> for fastest response. Thanks for looking! -Michael</Content>
