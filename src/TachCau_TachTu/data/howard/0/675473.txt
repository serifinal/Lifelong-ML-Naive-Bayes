		<Content>How do I quickly/easily identify what applications are installed to the microsd card on a n85 or n86? Firing up the Nokia Application Installer via PC Suite on a Windows PC, just shows the list of installed applications but doesn't distinguish if they are installed on the phone memory or the removable memory. I need to reformat the memory card, hence trying to list apps installed so I can re-install them.</Content>
