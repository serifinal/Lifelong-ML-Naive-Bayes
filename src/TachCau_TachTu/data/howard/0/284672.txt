		<Content>Hello all! Friday is the epic day where my girl and I make the switch to sprint with our pre-ordered Evo 4g's! That means we are looking to sell our AT&T phones because we will no longer need them! First Phone For Sale: iPhone 3G[S] Running unmolested 3.1.3 (this is my GF's phone and is in very mint condition. Comes with a pink iskin silicone case, box, manual, charger and anything else that it would come in new. The phone is 9.9/10 and i only say that because im sure you will find the tiniest little scratch, and i dont want negative feedback. 9.9/10 because its used, but never taken out of its case. Price: USDM $430 Shipped/Insured/Paypal'ed to anywhere in the continental US. Otherwise $420 plus whatever shipping costs are. Location: Chicago No trades unless its a GOOD deal (laptop/electronics/non phones) Heres how the case looks: For Sale: Nexus One with AT&T 3G bands. This phone is MINT. Theres not one scratch on this thing. Its been mine since the AT&T verison came out (2-3 months?) with the OEM google dock. the phone has been rooted and unlocked, and currently running the leaked build of Froyo 2.2. Its running stable, but the phone's ROMs can be changed on the fly. Again, this phone is MINT. Price: USDM $550 Shipped/Insured/Paypal'ed to anywhere in the continental US. Otherwise $540 plus whatever shipping costs are. Location: Chicago Pictures: Proof Of Ownership: I cannot ship until Friday at the latest. I will be picking up my EVO 4g's at 10:30AM central USA time and will be able to ship anytime after that. I have the EVO 4g's preordered so i WILL be getting them no questions asked. Thanks!
