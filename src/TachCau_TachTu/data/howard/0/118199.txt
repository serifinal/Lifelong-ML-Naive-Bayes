		<Content>Hey there, I activated an iPhone 3GS today and tried out the text messaging. I am able to send and receive texts from other Telus clients, but I can't seem to receive texts from a friend who is with Rogers. She receives everything I send to her, though. Anyone else experience a similar problem?</Content>
