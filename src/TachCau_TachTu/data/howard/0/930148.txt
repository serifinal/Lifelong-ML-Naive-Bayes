		<Content>I just activated my TELUS prepaid account yesterday (CDMA) for one reason, to use the $7 Unlimited Caling to One Number. My set up is quite simple: I have a vBuzzer VOIP Number that people will call me through it is forwarded to my TELUS prepaid account therefore, i have unlimited incoming calling. Sounds simple right? I test out the call and it charges me. I turned the Caller ID pass-through off and it still charges me. I tried 4 different configurations, all of them charged me! Does TELUS have a system in place that KNOWS i am forwarding a call via that number? Is there any way around this?</Content>
