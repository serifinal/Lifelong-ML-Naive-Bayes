		<Content>Just to clarify this for everyone: Ziphone, and iliberty+ are only made for iphones running 1.1.4 and lower firmware. Winpwn, pwnage tool, and quickpwn are only for iphones running 2.0 and higher firmwares. I feel this should be clarified because there are so many people making threads about how they are on a 2.0 firmware and used ziphone to jailbreak/unlock their and the phone end up bricking the phones. Programs like ziphone and iliberty+ have never been updated eversince the release of the 2.0 firmware and i feel everyone should know this before they decide to jailbreak and or unlock their iphones.</Content>
