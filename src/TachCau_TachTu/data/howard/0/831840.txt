		<Content>Feeling can't get unlocked in a short time, so I return my Bell Galaxy S to future shop yesterday. Before return, of course, I reset it to factory setting. But after that, when I tried the GPS, it won't work well. If you do a google search "galaxy s gps issue", you'll find quite a few complaining about the US version of galaxy s gps problem. But not sure our Bell version could have the same issue too? Here're my steps to reproduce the problem: 1) Do a factory reset. 2) manually delete some directories in the internal SD, since the factory reset didn't do it. 3) dial "*#*#1472365#*#*", it will take u to the GPS debug mode. Tap the "get position", it will try to connect gps and calculate the position. Before resetting, it was quite fast, in 5-10 seconds it will give you the position info. But after resetting, the position info never shown, though at the bottom those satellites info still shown (about 8 of them shown). But very strange, the position info not come out. 4) So I tried reset to factory setting again. then try step 3). Still the same result. I was wondering if any dir/file was deleted by me in the internal SD which could be the cause of the gps issue? But it's not logical. First the the "factory resetting" is suppose to do everything it needs to set it to original state (I did two resetting). Second, I guess those system apps are installed in the internal flash memory, instead of internal SD. But as those satellites info still there, so I assume the hardware still working, while it could be something wrong with the testing software? And I didn't try other GPS apps, like map or navigon. I don't want to set everything up since I reset it for return. Though, I really like galaxy s, and thinking of get it again once 3rd part unlock is available. But this GPS issue really worries me. So folks, could you please try the same thing and test the GPS. If more people can reproduce it, then it will be real problem, though I hope mine is the special case?</Content>
