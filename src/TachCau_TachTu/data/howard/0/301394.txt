		<Content>Bought the Samsung Vibrant about a week ago and I didn't really bother with samsung kies and always just used the mass storage mode. But now that I heard there's a new firmware update that fixes the gps and increases the battery a bit I need to use samsung kies to update. Crappy thing is everytime I try to use it Kies will just get stuck on "connecting the device... please wait". Does anyone have a solution for that?</Content>
