		<Content>So i started a thread a few days back looking for ways to setup iPhone 4 as a new phone rather than restoring it from backup of my iPhone 3G/3GS. Just in case, someone comes looking for it later, here is a quick writeup of what i found: How its done: What you need: 1) Jailbroken iPhone 3G/3GS 2) iPhone 4 setup as new phone and jailbroken. 3) iPhone Explorer installed on your PC or MAC. Steps: 1) On your iPhone 3G/3GS --> Install "AppLinks" from Cydia. This app creates a folder in your iphone that links all the applications in an easy to view manner. 2) On your iPhone 3G/3GS --> Run "AppLinks" and hit the "refresh" button. This is create all the links. 3) With your iPhone 3G/3GS still plugged in --> Open iPhone Explorer and browse to: "Your iPhone/Root Directory/var/mobile/AppLinks" 4) Copy any of the Application Data you want --> (For me, it was Angry Birds, SMS, voicemail, etc.) Folders to look in:Ruski?s iPhone/Root Directory/var/mobile/Library/SMS/sms.db Ruski?s iPhone/Root Directory/var/mobile/Library/Voicemail/voicemail.db Ruski?s iPhone/Root Directory/var/mobile/AppLinks/AngryBirds.app/Documents/ ...any other apps/games you treasure 5) Connect your new jailbroken iPhone 4 via USB and open up "iPhone Explorer" 6) Copy over any of the application settings files (*.plist, etc.) that you saved into the appropriate directories. Final Tips: It makes it easier to find your applications if you install AppLinks on iPhone 4 first. In some cases, you may need to run the application on the iPhone 4 first, so that it creates the initial directory structure and files for saved games/settings. Then browse via iPhone Explorer and copy. Let me know if you have any questions. Cheers.</Content>
