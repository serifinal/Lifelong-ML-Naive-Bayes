		<Content>Does anyone here know of repositories which I could add into cydia which could give me access to free cydia apps? There are some apps in cydia and rock for which you have to pay but I know there were some repositories which would allow you to install those apps straight from cydia without paying. Let me know if anyone knows them</Content>
