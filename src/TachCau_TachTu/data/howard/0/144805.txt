		<Content>Hi guys, I've noticed that the icons for the apps on my iPhone change randomly to that of another app... some of the games and apps on my phone have duplicate icons of a particular app or swap icons with another. I tried searching but can't find a solution ... anyone else having this issue??</Content>
