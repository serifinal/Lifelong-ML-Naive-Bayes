		<Content>I know this is a very basic question but I cannot seem to understand what t-mobile.com has on this subject I have two questions: Do you have to renew your contract when you add a line? Does that automatically make your plan a "Family Plan?" Please tell me if I am understanding this correctly: you pay $10/month to get an extra number which uses minutes from your original plan (as opposed to a new plan)? Thanks!!!</Content>
