		<Content>I have been poking around the internet for a bit here. And I am wondering if anyone has rooted the Bell Galaxy. I found some how tos for german and such. But because of the different radios, I dont want to brick this one (it's not mine, doing it for a friend who wants tethering and some other rooted apps). Ideas?</Content>
