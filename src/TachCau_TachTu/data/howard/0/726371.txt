		<Content>I have a very good condition Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant from Bell. Its about 2 months old. Its unlocked and its stock. Hasn't been rooted or modded otherwise. Has a small scuff on the bezel but other than that its in mint condition. Only used the charger so the headset is still brand new and sealed. Looking for $450 obo (lowballers will be ignored). No trades accepted. Pics will be uploaded soon. Located in the GTA</Content>
