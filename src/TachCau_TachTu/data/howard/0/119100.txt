		<Content>I am wondering if the coverage has improved in the far S.W. ( end of Bow trail/Wentworth ) yet? It was very spotty a couple of months ago. I see on the Wind coverage maps now that there is a red/covered area in two tones of Red in Calgary? Is the darker red supposed to mean something?</Content>
