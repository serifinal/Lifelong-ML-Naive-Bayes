		<Content>Hello, a friend of mine has an IPHONE and I regularly send text messages to him via xxxxxxxxxx@txt.att.net, from my work email server. Last weekend or so I received failure notices from cingularme.com. Now he receives several old text (maybe 3 months old) every time I send a new text from my email. I suspect some changes were made on ATT side and now he has some old texts that are stuck on his account. I am the email administrator for my domain and things look fine on my exchange server. Any ideas on how to correct this issue?</Content>
