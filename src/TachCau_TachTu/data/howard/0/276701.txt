		<Content>P0sixninja posted several utilities which will most likely be used in future jailbreaks and unlock solutions. Here is a description of each from this link http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=9875 P0sixninja from the Chronic Dev Team has announced the release of four new jailbreak utilities and begun publishing the source for greenpois0n. idevicerestore: A new tool capable of restoring IPSWs to devices without the help of iTunes. Also capable of doing other neat stuff such as upgrading stock firmware without flashing nor (to preserve jailbreaks) or baseband (to preserve unlocks). ideviceactivate: A new utility to designed to activate devices without the help of iTunes. Hopefully soon this will even allow users to activate unlocked devices, or devices without an official AT&T SIM. spirit-linux: An open source version of the Spirit jailbreak for the Linux platform (and possibly soon others). libirecovery: A library to help developers communicating with iBoot, iBSS, iBEC and DFU, as well as a brand new, completely rewritten, and MUCH improved irecovery. We've begun publishing the source for some of our greenpois0n components to help new developers start learning and building their very own jailbreak programs. Each one of these components is named after a different poison and all are available under the GNU Public License on our Chronic-Dev Github Repositories. GreenPois0n Cyanide: Is a cross-platform iBoot payload toolkit to help developers discover new vulnerabilities and design super fast, low-level iBoot jailbreaks and exploit payloads, much like the way blackra1n/purplera1n works. GreenPois0n Anthrax: Is a cross-platform iPhone ramdisk toolkit to help developers design extremely stable and portable ramdisk jailbreaks, much like the same way quickpwn/redsn0w works. GreenPois0n Dioxin: Is cross-platform MobileDevice toolkit designed to help developers design awesome userlevel jailbreaks, much the same way spirit jailbreak works. GreenPois0n Arsenic: new, cross-platform custom firmware toolkit to help developers design jailbreaks to help preserve baseband and keep unlocks, much in the same way PwnageTool/Sn0wBreeze works. P0sixninja also discusses the possible sources for a new unlock, including the one discovered by Sherif Hashim, a new untethered iBoot vulnerability which was discovered by both geohot and Chronic-Dev Team, and a brand new bootrom code execution vulnerability discovered by himself personally (and probably geohot too). If you would like to contribute you can donation to p0sixninja's new iPhone4g donations fund. Even just donations of old or broken devices is important.</Content>
