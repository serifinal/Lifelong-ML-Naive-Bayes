		<Content>I called At&t and I called my local corporate At&t store. They informed me that if I wanted, I could purchase one of the Sim cards that can be cut into a Micro Sim card. I visited my local At&t store and they refused to sell me a Sim/Micro Sim outright or to replace my current sim in a Blackberry. Is this normal policy, or just another case of mis-informed sales people? Thank you</Content>
