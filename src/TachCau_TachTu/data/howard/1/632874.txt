		<Content>I need a phone which can sync calendars and contacts with outlook. I don't need email on my phone. I have an xv 6800 now, and despise the thing. I'm due for a new contract, so I was looking at the enV 3. (I realize I'm a rare bread that wants to sync cal/contacts but no data/email) According to LG's site, LGs Sync Program, they have a program that can sync with Outlook. Has anyone had any experience with this?</Content>
