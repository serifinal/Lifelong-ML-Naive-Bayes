		<Content>I've been interested in the Droid/Milestone for a while, however, I'm more interested in the HTC Desire. I wish it had a physical keyboard though, but given the faster processor than in the Milestone (1ghz versus 550mhz), I think I'd rather have a Desire. Has anyone heard anything about either the Nexus One or the Desire coming to Telus or another Canadian carrier?</Content>
