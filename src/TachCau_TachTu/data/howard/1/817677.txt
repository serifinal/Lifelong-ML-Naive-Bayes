		<Content>Well I missed the initial iPhone preorder due to all the wonkiness with online preorders. I am going to be in San Francisco on launch day and had wanted to preorder one for in-store pickup the 24th. What are the odds I can get one if I wait in line at one of the San Fran Apple stores?</Content>
