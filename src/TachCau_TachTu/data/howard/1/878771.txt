		<Content>Hello. I've never owned a smartphone before and am looking at jumping straight to the iPhone 4 when it's released. I currently have a nice phone-only plan from Telus (no data), so I do intend with sticking with them into the future. If I buy my iPhone from Apple, i've read that it'll be 'unlocked', thus able to go on to the carrier of my choice (Telus!). How would I get a micro-SIM card from Telus? Would it be less complicated to purchase my iPhone 4 through Telus instead? Would delivery times from Apple vs. Telus be similar? Thanks!</Content>
