		<Content>Hi, I'm new here. I would like a new phone. Is there a list where I can find all the phones that can work on Boost Mobile (flashed). I have been thinking of the Blackberry Curve 8350i. Are there any new ones coming out or there any one's on Sprint I can use? Thanks for the help. I would like to have one of those HTC phones with Android if possible.</Content>
