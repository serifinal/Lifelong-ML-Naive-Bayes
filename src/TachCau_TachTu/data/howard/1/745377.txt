		<Content>What's the cheapest way to get a Samsung Wave and/or Galaxy S as a new customer? I got some friends who are new Bell customers too and they were able to get some excellent plans from Bell a while back, something that's comparable to my own Fido plan in sig. I understand they're smart phones so they both require data plans to get them at the Bell and Best Buy advertised price, but what if I don't get a data plan?</Content>
