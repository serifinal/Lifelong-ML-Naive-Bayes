		<Content>Apple iPad got announced today (Wednesday, January 27th, 2010), along with it's data plan has been announced and its going to be: ~$30 a month for unlimited ~$15 a month for 250mb -Activatable/Purchasable directly on the device (Possibly through a portal) -All plans are prepaid (AT&T GoPhone) -All Plans include free of AT&T Hotspots The iPad comes unlocked so that it can be used on any standard 3g network (No 3g when using T-Mobile, They didn't follow 3G standards unlike Apple) The iPad uses a new standard for SIM Cards called "MicroSIM" which will be rolling out across all US GSM networks very soon as devices that require them become publicly available ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ So, do you think there will be someway to get this on other GoPhones or even maybe the iPhone? What about Tmobile Adopting such a Data Model?</Content>
