		<Content>I am interested in tethering a TM506 with a Cradlepoint router. While I have seen mention of this ability on the forum, the specific Cradlepoint model is not listed. I have also looked on Cradlepoint's website, but could not find the TM506 listed. Any recommendations of known working Cradlepoint routers to tether with the TM506 to create a mobile WiFi hotspot?</Content>
