		<Content>I am looking on eBay for a data transfer cable to use with Bitpim or datapilot for reading the contacts off the phone. But I've noticed that if I search for (ax155,"ax 155") (data,transfer,usb,cable) the prices are (naturally) higher than a search for (microusb,"micro usb") (data,transfer,usb,cable). But will pretty much any data cable work? Especially if it mentions it's compatible with a similar LG phone? Also what software works with the AX* phones? Will LG Desktop, LG Phone Manager, or LG Phone Tools work with them? I bought an AX5000 off of eBay and want to move my stuff over to it.</Content>
