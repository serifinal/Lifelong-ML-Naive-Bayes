		<Content>Hey guys - I know there`s a retention sticky at the top, but just a quick question: from your experiences, is it possible to negotiate successfully with retentions before your contract expires? Currently, I'm about 9 months out from the end of my contract and I really want to pick up a BB 9700 before then because my HTC Touch is crapping out on me. However, I don't want to renew without getting some type of bonus. Any thoughts?</Content>
