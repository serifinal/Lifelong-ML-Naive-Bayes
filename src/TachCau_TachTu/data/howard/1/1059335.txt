		<Content>i was thinking of getting the blackberry for my wife with the Unlimited International Calling plan. it says its $10 a month on top of the $60 rate plan. the other $60 plan comes with it and the smartphone plan is $50 a month and $10 to add it and it brings it to $60 also. so $70 a month for blackberry users. is that an error on the website. i tried calling metro but they didnt have a clue of the new flat rate changes that included the tax. i was shocked and hung up.</Content>
