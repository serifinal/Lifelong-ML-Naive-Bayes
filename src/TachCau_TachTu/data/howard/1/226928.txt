		<Content>I use my bluetooth headset about "2 times" a year. During summer time for about 2~3 months, and winter time for about 1 month. Summer is coming again, and I started using my Voyager 510 that I got 1.5 year ago. It has been FLAWLESS. Despite its UGLY design, sound quality and fitment was 11 out of 10 for me. I totally fell in love with Plantronics. However, this year is no good. I charged it fully and just used it, and there is a lot of sound distortion. Its not the echo problem, but just static noise. Keep in mind, I always use this headset in exact same environment with nothing changed. For example, I use it most of the times in my car or in my work room. Same car, same place. No additional bluetooth/wifi stuff added that might cause the distortion. I tried to lower the volume but the same distortion is there. I don't think the person on the other side can hear it, noise is within just my headset. This never happened before. I tried to reset bluetooth, reset connection, etc. Didn't work. Im not angry at the headset actually, Im just bummed that such good headset is crapping out on me. Does anyone know how to solve this issue? Mean while, Im researching on a new headset. I thought about upgrading to Voyager Pro, but seeing so many people going back to 510 or purchasing 510 instead of PRO due to price/performance ratio and some static issue with Pros, Im a little skeptic about the Pro. It seems like Aliph Jawbone Prime, Plantronics Discovery 975 is doing well according to magazine reviews. Is this true? Can someone recommend me a headset under $100? Appearence is a zero concern. Im more geared towards fitment and sound quality.</Content>
