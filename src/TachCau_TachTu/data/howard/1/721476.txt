		<Content>I'm getting ready to buy one as I've done away with AT&T + the iPhone 3GS (Love it but too expensive), so I jumped ship to the Tmobile and thinking about getting a Nexus One. My big question is, what is the battery life like on this device? With respectable backlight brightness (50%) to get the daily pop from the screen but what is your typical battery life like?? Also can anyone recommend a good headphone for the nexus one (hopefully pressing a button to scroll to the next song) and what music app to use to play songs?</Content>
