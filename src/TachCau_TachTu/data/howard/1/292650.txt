		<Content>Looking to upgrade soon and might have the option of getting a phone with just 850 3g band and wanted to see if there was a way to test coverage locally. My blackjack does both so that doesn't help alone, and if I set it to 850 gsm it loses all signal. That might mean no 850 3g, but wanted to be sure that was the case and if not conclusive what I can do to see signals in the area.</Content>
