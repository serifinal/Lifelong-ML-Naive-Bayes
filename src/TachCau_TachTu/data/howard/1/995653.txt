		<Content>I am currently with AT&T and looking to switch over to Verizon to get myself a shiny new Droid. My mom is currently on Verizon by herself (just a voice/text, 1 line plan). I would like to add myself onto her plan. How can I do this? From what I've gathered on the Verizon website and several forum posts, it looks like my best option is to get the Nationwide Select Family SharePlan. $99.99 (that's $90 plus $9.99 for the second line) for 700 shared minutes, unlimited texts. Then since I'll be getting the Droid, I'll need the $29.99 data plan for my line. She doesn't need data. She has a 20% company discount so ($90 - 20%) + $9.99 + $29.99 = $111.98 plus taxes/fees. Am I correct in that this plan is available and will meet my needs? Also, it is my understanding that the 2-year contracts on each line are independent of one another; is that correct? That is, my mom's contract still has a few months remaining, but I will still be able to get the Droid for $199.99 with a new 2 year contract for my new line, right? And she will still have her contract expire in a few months as usual (i.e. no forced contract extension for her)? Thank you for your help. James</Content>
