		<Content>Does anyone know if a version of the Galaxy S is going to be released with the AT&T 3g bands? I've heard AT&T is supposed to be receiving the Captivate, however, I have no interest in picking up a branded (and most likely crippled) phone. I wanted to purchase an unbranded and unlocked Galaxy S that supports AT&T 3g, but I search google and the forums here and found no information about where to purchase one, or if one even exists. It shows on gsmarena.com that there is supposed to be a version of the Galaxy S with AT&T bands but I wanted to know if anyone has any information on where to purchase one or if one is actually going to be released and when. Thanks!</Content>
