		<Content>My wife doesn't really want the HTC Eris with the data plan so if I was to buy the Motorola Droid for myself and put the free HTC Eris on my wife's phone number temporarily for 1 day, would I then be able to switch my wife's phone number back to her old Env with no data plan and sell her "free" Eris on eBay (clear ESN?)? What a schemer I am. This would be too good to be true since both require a new 2 year activation with a data plan.</Content>
