		<Content>I am considering a Bold 9700 purchase. Is it possible to sync with Microsoft Office 2007 Business Contact Manager *without* first copying all the contacts to Outlook? The reason that I am asking is that I currently own a Palm Treo 750 and I need to first copy my contacts from Business Contact Manager into the contacts in Outlook before I can sync with Microsoft ActiveSync. Thank you in advance.</Content>
