		<Content>Hey currently out of contract with bell right now. Looking at 2 16G Iphones. Looking at both of the 60$ per line options with both companies. Which has more to offer in your guys opinion? Should I take this opportunity to bounce from Bell, or could I get the better offer from them?</Content>
