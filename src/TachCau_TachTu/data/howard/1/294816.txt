		<Content>Just got the Droid when it was released but I still have my eye on the Pre Plus! I know the hardware specs are not as good as the Droid but I still love it! Is anyone else in the same boat as me? I am really considering switching.. Touchstone..Multitouch..Portrait Keyboard...More pocket-able.. Looking at one major negative would be going back to: VZW Nav</Content>
