		<Content>Now that the unlock issue has been solved I am seriously considering getting a Vibrant from Bell, unlocking it and using it on Rogers for a number of reasons: * I like the styling better * 2 cameras * FM radio * money does not go to Rogers Main concern is that the Bell version seems to have 3G 900/1900/2100 whereas Rogers is 850/1900. How big a coverage issue is this going to be. Is there any way to breakout the Rogers 3G coverage maps by frequency? I am assuming 2G is not going to be an issue (I am assuming quad band GSM as all the Galaxy S models I can find info for seem to be GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900).</Content>
