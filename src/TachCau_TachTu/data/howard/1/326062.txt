		<Content>I'm looking to buy 2 *BNIB SEALED* Rogers iPhone 3gs 16gb. Not looking to lowball anyone or get it dry myself. I'm located in Edmonton, AB. PM me if you have what I'm looking for and for a fair price. Cash in hand or via PayPal (I'm a verified/confirmed business member). PS: The colours are not a deal breaker, but must be sealed and no refurbs.</Content>
