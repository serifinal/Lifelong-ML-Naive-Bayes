		<Content>Heya, So I've finally decided on iPhone, I currently have a BB Storm 1 and I have about 17months left on my contract. I have unlimited data on my BB Storm. I'm thinking of purchasing an iPhone from apple and continuing my contract with telus. Is that possible? ...of course, unless I weasle a subsidized iPhone4 from telus for another 3 years.... cheers.</Content>
