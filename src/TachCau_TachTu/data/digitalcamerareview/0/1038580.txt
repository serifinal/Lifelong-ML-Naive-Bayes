		<Content>First time on this site and I have a question I have been able to answer. Bought a SX20. Can anyone answer why I cannot achieve a higher resolution than 3 mp? I am not an avid photographer and this is my first camera but would like to know if I can achieve a resolution that is closer to the the rating of the camera. Any help would be appreciated.</Content>
