		<Content>Hey everybody! The following video was shot on a Canon T2i/550D. I wanted to rent a higher end "Red" camera but my budget wouldn't allow it. My director Brian Kim insisted that we use his Canon T2i/550D instead. Please let me know what you think! Thanks for watching!!!! YouTube - Damozel - Take A Picture</Content>
