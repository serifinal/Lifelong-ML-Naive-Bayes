		<Content>My Rebel XT does not seem to support 4 GB CF card. It works well with 2 GB cards. Has anyone used a 4 GB CF card on their Rebel XT or 350 D ? After formatting the CF Card with the IN CAMERA format option, the camera takes about 16 - 18 shots before displaying "Err CF" I think the Rebel XT is right in rejecting the 4 GB card for the following reason. The display of balance shots is a 3 digit counter with a maximum display of 999. Theoretically, the 4GB would have a capacity 1000+ shots, which the display cannot show the user. What are your comments on this ?</Content>
