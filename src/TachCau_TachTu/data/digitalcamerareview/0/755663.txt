		<Content>Is this normal behavior? In composition mode, the LCD screen shows vertical lines and anomalies when there is a bright spot such as glare or very high contrast such as a bright window in a darker room. The lines do not show up in the recorded picture, just in the viewscreen during composition. I have two of these cameras and both exhibit the same problem. Canon support was useless.</Content>
