		<Content>I have had a Canon SX30 for about a year and have been very pleased, images look great on laptop or printed. I have just invested in a home media server accessed via a Sony BDP 480. All of the pics I have taken on the Canon look terrible, yet all of my previous Casio files look great. I have tried shooting at max size and smooth compression and the problem persists Grateful for any ideas - and happy new year Al</Content>
