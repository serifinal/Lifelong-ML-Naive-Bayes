		<Content>Today, Panasonic has announced three new cameras in their "sleek & slim" FX line. The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX50 and Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX07 shoot at 7.2 megapixels, while the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX3 is a 6 megapixel camera. All three cameras feature Panasonic's Intelligent ISO Control (IIC) that can automatically adjust ISO based on the movement of the subject. All three cameras will be available in September. The FX50 will have an MSRP of $399, the FX07 will have an MSRP of $349, and the FX3 will have an MSRP of $279.

The Leica lenses of the FX50 and FX07 cameras provide a wide angle 28mm (35mm equivalent) and a full optical zoom range of 3.6x (28-102mm, 35mm equivalent). The Lumix DMC-FX3 will have a 3x optical zoom with a 35mm equivalent wide angle setting. All three cameras are outfitted with the new Intelligent ISO Control from Panasonic. This technology allows the cameras to automatically adjust the ISO (sensitivity) of the camera in order to adjust the shutter speed, as needed, depending on subject movement. For example, if the camera sees a quickly moving subject, it will increase the ISO (and therefore, the shutter speed) to better capture a quickly moving subject. With a stationary subject, no ISO boost is needed. Both the FX50 and FX07 can boost sensitivity up to ISO 1250, while the FX3 can get up to ISO 1600. The FX50 features a 3 inch, 230k pixel LCD, while the FX07 and FX3 both feature a 2.5 inch LCD (FX07 has 207k pixels and FX3 has 115k pixels). The FX50 can do an estimated 300 shots per charge, while the FX07 and FX3 will get 320 shots per charge. All three cameras will accept SD, SDHC, and MMC memory media. As far as colors, the FX50 will come in silver or black; the FX07 will come in silver, black, blue, or red, each with a textured finish; and the FX3 will come in silver or black.
