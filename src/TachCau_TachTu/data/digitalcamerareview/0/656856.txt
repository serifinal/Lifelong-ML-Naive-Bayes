		<Content>i have a canon powersht S3IS and I accidentally dropped it on my lawn. Everything seemed ok until I noticed this tiny piece of metal sticking out on the top. It is protruding from the "seam" between where the front of the camera meets the top of the camera - right above the powershot logo. It seems it may be causing my pictures to be slightly out of focus. Repairs are sooooo expensive, I checked the canon website and it gave me a repair estimate of $147 - I hate to pay half of what the camera cost me to repair this! I have attached photo's of the problem - please let me know if you think I can repair this myself.</Content>
