		<Content>Hi. Recently my pics have been a little blurry and I can't seem to fix this problem. I take mostly bird and animal shots using the Auto focus setting. I work at the zoo and we've had two giraffe births in the past two weeks! SO, I really want to get some pics but know I should study the manual further but just wanted to throw out a quick "help please." Thanks so much in advance. Beth</Content>
