		<Content>Hello all. I currently have the Canon sd800IS. While its a great camera, i'm still not pleased w/ the picture quality, especially coming from the A95. I recently purchased the SD550 on ebay for a bargain of $160 in mint condition. Besides the image stabilization, is there really a diff in picture quality between the two pocket cams? i know the sd550 has a bigger sensor so will that make a noticeable difference? thanks!</Content>
