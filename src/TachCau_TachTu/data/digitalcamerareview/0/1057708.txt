		<Content>Hi, Just a brief question. Does anyone know if there is a way to find out the %charge left in a Canon LiIon battery (specifically for the PowerShot G9)? I have two batteries and I need to store them for longer periods of time. The best charge level to store a LiIon battery is 43% (40-50% will do). The charge indicator on my G9 is really imprecise (I just get 3 lines which can be empty or full... and I don't even know if the scale is linear, for instance once I go from 2 to 1 line left, the battery doesn't last much longer). So it's really guesswork on when I get to 50%... If there is no way to read %, even some suggestions on how to do the guesswork will be appreciated. (BTW: the manual says discharge fully then store, which is dumb, this regime harms LiIon batteries) Thanks.</Content>
