		<Content>(Updated to elminate the need to link to Steve's Forums.) I took some shots of resolution test patterns using an SD700, which may help someone decide what camera to buy. The shooting distances were chosen so the scene was a flat area about 9x12 feet for all views. Test patterns were put near the extreme corners and also just inside points 2' in (diag.) from the corners. Also test patterns were put in the middle of the scene. So that the attachment file would be smaller, some cut and paste was done which makes the diagrams not to scale and also parts of the scene with no test patterns were omitted. Three views are presented here as attachments below, (left thumbnail below) widest angle, (center) about 2x zoom, and (right) maximum 4x zoom. All looked about the same except the widest angle shot had some softness at the lower right corner. Notice the tick marks alongside each test pattern. The fourth tick mark from the narrow end corresponds to about 1500 TVL (television lines) over a distance equal to the picture height. The fifth tick mark corresponds to about 1100 TVL/ph. (Two TVL equal one line pair.) I conclude that the resolution was around or a little better than 1500 TVL/ph at the center, around 1500 TVL/ph for most of the picture area not too close to the edges, and around 1300 TVL/ph over much of the edges. Places where resolution fell short of 1100 TVL/ph existed but were rare and only at the edges. My own conclusion was that the image sensor and the internal processing and JPEG compression were the limiting factor in the middle of the picture, with the camera lens being the limiting factor at the corners and edges. With some zoom, the picture quality at the edges was better. Widest angle view was hand held, other zoom views were shot from a tripod with the self timer. Image stabilization was off. Camera was set to largest pixel count and file size, and superfine mode. Shooting conditions were outdoors, sunny day, subject in open shade. ___________ (finally figured this out) Internet Explorer Users: To properly click to enlarge these attachments you need to disable size-to-fit otherwise what you see becomes meaningless. Click Tools in the browser menu bar and choose Internet Options. In the little window click Advanced, scroll down to Multimedia, and uncheck Enable Automatic Image Resizing. Other browser (such as AOL) users may also need to prevent resizing or otherwise zoom the images.</Content>
