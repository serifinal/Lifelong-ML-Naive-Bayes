		<Content>I knew the LCD screen on the Canon A720IS didn't have good resolution (115,000 pixels) but I've discovered that it also doesn't show decent color. The colors are incorrect - for example red looks like red/orange. Also, the colors appear washed out. Fortunately, the colors look great on the computer screen. Anyone notice this? Do I have a defective LCD screen?</Content>
