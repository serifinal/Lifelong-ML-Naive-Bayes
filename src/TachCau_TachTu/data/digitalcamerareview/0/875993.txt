Olympus C-8080 Wide Zoom - "...top choice for serious shooters, it offers excellent picture quality and good feature depth."

Full Article Nikon encrypting white balance data in RAW files Reported at PhotoshopNews.com, Nikon has started encrypting the white balance data that the D2X stores when shooting in RAW mode. In a forum posting, Thomas Knoll, chief engineer and the original author of Photoshop explained the consequences of encrypted data - third party data readers are now not able to reverse engineer the file format without fear of legal repercussions under the DMCA.

Police obtained images from Sprint taken by the cell phone of a man charged with indecent behavior (Sprint stores all images taken by phone users on their servers). The man used the cell phone to take some pictures that the police hope to use as evidence. This ruling may set a precedent about the use of camera phone pictures as evidence since up until now, there have been no criminal cases that have included such evidence.</Content>
