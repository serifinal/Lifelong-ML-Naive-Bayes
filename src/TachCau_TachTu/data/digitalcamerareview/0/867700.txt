		<Content>My new 450d Xsi just died last night. It is only a few weeks old and I am in the NC mountains on vacation. the camera was fine but while transfering pictures to my pc, the camera shut off. I have 4 fully charged bateries and none of them make any difference. there is NO nothing when I turn on the unit. Any ideas for quick help?? I'm in the Banner Elk/Asheville NC area right now and have several picture taking days left. Thanks Randy</Content>
