		<Content>I am having a few potential issues with my camera. -When I move the camera when its off, I hear a sound as if there is a loose screw rolling around inside. Could it be something else? -When the camera is on and I am zooming I hear this flickering sound. I think it might be the auto focus adjusting. Any ideas? Bear in mind this is my first digital camera so I am not familiar with the usual sounds of a digital camera. Thanks alot</Content>
