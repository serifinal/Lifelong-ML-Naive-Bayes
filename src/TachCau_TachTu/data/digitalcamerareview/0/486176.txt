		<Content>Hello, I have a 5 year old Canon Powershot S230 Digital ELPH that has been working seamlessly and has never missed a beat. Today I went to use it, and all I get is black. I have clicked on the 'DISP' button to see if the LCD Display was off and it was on. I cannot see anything to take pictures and I cannot see anything to review pictures that have been taken. I have actually taken three pictures that load into my computer, but they are completely black. I have a fully charged battery, and I have also 'reset' the camera by holding the menu button. The camera is not used a lot and has not been subjected to heat or cold or dropped or submersed in water. I am mystified? Any help is greatly appreciated?</Content>
