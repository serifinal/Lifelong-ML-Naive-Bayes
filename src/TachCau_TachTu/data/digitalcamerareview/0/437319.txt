		<Content>First of all, i'm new to the website so I'd like to say Hi. I was drawn here by Howard Creech who i've read a couple of his reviews on epinions.com. I like to consider myself a novice in the world of photography, even though from time to time I impress myself with my ability to "find" or "see" shots as I commute. With my first camera being a Nikon 3mp, I always took great shots, and particularly took alot of night shots of my car. The problem I would get is, the sky or ground would always come out grainy or noisy. I tended to always blame it on the fact it only had 3mp. I figured the higher the better, even if it does come at a larger file size. I recently purchased a Canon SD630, with 6mp, and I was really hoping to purchase an 8mp camera, thinking that would have been the best I can get in a "point-and-shoot" camera before I take the leap into DSLR. My friend has the Sony N1 and I've seen how clean and clear his pictures come out, and quite honestly, I wanted and craved that clarity. I've only taken a few pictures with my Canon 6mp and i've noticed I still get noise. I think part of it is user-error, as i've tried messing with the ISO (from what I read, thats the shutter speed adjustment?). It left me pretty disappointed, and i'm trying to weigh my options before my 14-day return is up, if i'm unhappy with my purchase. I'm open to advice and criticism, so please post up any tips or tricks I might actually benefit from. This camera has alot of options I never have had or used that might be part of the problem. Also, how am I able to adjust the megapixel selection on each picture? For example, is there a way to select 4mp instead of 6mp? The reason I ask is because I think I might have accidentally selected a lower mp rating, and maybe thats why I didn't get a good picture turn-out. When I get home, i'll try and post the picture to show you guys what I mean. I'm still looking for a free-upload site somewhere where I can post my albums.</Content>
