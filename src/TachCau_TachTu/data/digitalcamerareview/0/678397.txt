		<Content>Forgot to ask in my last post, what is a low level format and should I be selecting it? I bought an SD512 MB memory card so I could take better quality pictures and fit more and I'm not sure which choice I am supposed to pick for formatting it. The card is not from Canon, it's PNY technologies - don't know if this matters or not. Thanks! This forum has been very helpful to me!</Content>
