		<Content>I purchased a lens adapter for my new G12 with the thought that it might be a way to protect the lens and be a bit of a lens hood. I know, the filter adapter FA-DC58B would be a better choice - it is on order. Using the LA I interestingly found that at the G12 widest lens setting, the hood clipped the image. Also I found the LA comes in two parts - anyone know why that is? I haven't found anything about that in the sparse document Canon sent with the LA. Thanks, Tom</Content>
