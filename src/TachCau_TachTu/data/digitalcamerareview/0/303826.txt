		<Content>I orginaly bought a Nikon coolpix L 18 after being talked into and ended up going back and getting the Canon A590 IS but when I got home read the manual and stared shooting it was really, really slow some pics came out blurry not all. The slowness is what started to get to me. I kept it in easy mode as well, same thing. I ended up getting really frusturated and took it back and got the Coolpix again. I just wanted to upgrade I was using a kodak z740 before Now I am sitting here wandering if I made mistake with keeping the Coolpix? Any suggestions? Thanks</Content>
