		<Content>I'm a point & shot guy with very little camera savvy. That's why I bought a P&S I can't seem to get those crisp clear pics that I used to get when I first bought the camera. Anything relatively close up comes out blurry and none of my pics have that - jump out off the page - quality that I've seen with you folks. I'm very camera techno challenged ........... oh yeah...... is there a way I can download a copy of my users manual? I only have the Spanish one...... Thanks Tommy</Content>
