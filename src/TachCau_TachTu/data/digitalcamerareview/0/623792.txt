		<Content>I'm enjoying my new SX110 but I'm having a hard time getting crisp clear focusing in two situations. 1. Up-close objects. Sometimes they come out clear but often they are blurry. I've tried the Auto as well as Portrait and a couple other settings both with and w/o flash but i havent been able to figure the most optimal way to use the camera for taking pictures of close objects. 2. Pictures of my baby who is never quite perfectly still. I tried the "kids and pets" setting but that doesnt seem to do the trick. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!</Content>
