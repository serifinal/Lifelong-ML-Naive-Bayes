		<Content>Was on the forums in the Kodak area. Bought a V1253; it broke in a week. Got a second one and it lasted just a little longer. Don't want to trash a MFG but, will say I am much happier with my Canon SD950IS. Is a great camera! Looking forward to being a part of this forum and learning from you all. Alan</Content>
