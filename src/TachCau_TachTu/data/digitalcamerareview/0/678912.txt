		<Content>I have a 3 year old canon powershot a85. it was working fine until recently it's screen started to flicker. It only happens while taking a picture, there are lines and the display is not still but keeps flickering. This happens for 4-5 minutes and then it goes away. The pictures come out fine though. Does anyone know why this might be happening? Is this camera dying?</Content>
