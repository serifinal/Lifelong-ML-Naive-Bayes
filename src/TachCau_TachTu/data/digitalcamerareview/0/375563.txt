		<Content>About 2 years ago I replaced the LCD screen in my canon SD400, no big whoop. Due to some circumstances beyond my control, my canon SD790IS got ran over by a car. The camera amazingly survived with only a cracked LCD. I disassembled the exterior of the camera and removed the old LCD screen, but the ribbon cable on the 790IS is in a substantially different place than on the SD400... I have no idea how to connect a new one. Do I need to remove the shutter button to access the ribbon connector? thanks, atek3</Content>
