		<Content>I intend to shoot portrait photos with a Canon EOS 5D, Could any one recommend a ideal strobe lighting set for this. A link for showing what is it the set, list what they think is best. Something like that. The more detailed the better. Better yet, any one with a Canon EOS 5D that shoots portrait photography. If they would be so kind to list their lighting equipment. The more detailed the better Also is their a 10 second delay feature for taking a picture with that camera? I am also using a CHROMAKEY GREEN SCREEN for the background, does this affect the lighting? Many thanks to all those that participate!</Content>
