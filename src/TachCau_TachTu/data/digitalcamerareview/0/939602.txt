		<Content>Hello, I just to make sure that I did this correctly for my Canon. When there is a dust or particles on the lens, can I use a compress air can to blast the stuffs away? I know that need a screen protector for the screen, I already bought one, it should arrive at Tuesday. When I want to clean the camera phyically (of course not the lens), can I use a damp cloth and then dry cloth? Thanks. JC</Content>
