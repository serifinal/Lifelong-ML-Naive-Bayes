		<Content>Hi everyone - I seem to be missing a TON of shots because I go to take the pic and my camera won't shoot - then I have to wait a few secs, hold down the shutter slightly until frame locks in, then I can take the shot (for canon users - I hold down until I hear the beeping "lock in" noise and then can take the shot). What is going on with it?!</Content>
