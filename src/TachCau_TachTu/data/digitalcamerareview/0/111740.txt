		<Content>Fujifilm has announced the Finepix S5 Pro, a professional quality digital SLR, and the Finepix F31fd, the first compact camera to feature their face-detection system. The Finepix S5 Pro will be available in early 2007 and the Finepix F31fd will be available in December for $399. Fujifilm Finepix S5 Pro The S5 Pro is the successor to the S3 Pro - almost an industry standard for wedding photographers. The S5 Pro improves upon the S3 Pro with a newer, more advanced sensor that allows for a greater dynamic range and smoother tonality between shades of light and dark. A new Real Photo Processor Pro produces more film-like images.
