		<Content>I sold all my SLR stuff a couple of decades ago. Too much stuff. Have been using various Canon Elf cameras since. Bought myself a Canon G12 for Christmas. I like it. It seems to be a good step between an Elf and a full DSLR. Now, I'm playing with it. Fun. Question: I'd like to adapt my Celestron C8. Is it possible? Is there a T-adapter mount? Thanks in advance.
