		<Content>I have had my camera for 2 days, it was FedExed from Beach Camera. When on, there are glowing spots on the LCD that are hazy and purple, about the size of half a pea. They are just right of center. When I turn the camera off, the spots glow green for a second before turning totally off. Is it worth packing it back up and returning it? The LCD is clean, no fingerprints. I just do not know if these spots will get worse.</Content>
