		<Content>Hi there, I recently bought the Canon Rebel EOS T1i DSLR. I have recently been given some old lens that are compatible with the Canon AE1 which is a manual film camera. The lens obviously don't fit the Rebel but is there any kind of adapter on the market that I can buy so that these old lens will work with my new camera? Thanks</Content>
