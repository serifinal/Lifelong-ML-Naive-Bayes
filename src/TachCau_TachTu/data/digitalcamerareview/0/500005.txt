Press Release: GOLDEN, CO (February 1, 2006)...PENTAX Imaging Company has announced a significant price adjustment on the *ist DL digital SLR camera with 18-55 DA lens kit. The price reduction from $799.95 US to $599.95 US takes effect February 1, 2006. "Digital single lens reflex cameras with interchangeable lenses are gaining in popularity as products have become easier-to-use and prices have fallen," said Ed Lee, Director, Consumer Services and Digital Photography Trends Service InfoTrends, Inc. "Consumers wavering between a higher-end compact digital and a digital SLR will take note of this new PENTAX pricing as will consumers who have been considering an upgrade to a digital SLR," added Lee. World-renowned for decades for delivering small, lightweight, easy-to-use and affordable SLR systems including bodies, lenses and flashes, PENTAX now offers a suite of nine digital lenses specifically designed for use with PENTAX digital SLR bodies.

" PENTAX is the first camera manufacturer to offer a digital SLR kit at a price that entry-level users can afford," said Ned Bunnell, marketing director, PENTAX Imaging Company. "In fact, PENTAX is repeating our heritage of 30 years ago when we introduced the K1000, one of the most popular and affordable entry-level film SLRs ever manufactured," added Bunnell. PENTAX introduced the K1000 SLR film camera in 1976 and sold more than 2.5 million units during the life cycle of the product. Though no longer manufactured, the camera remains popular among students and beginners for its durability, affordability and easy operation in learning the basic fundamentals of photography.
