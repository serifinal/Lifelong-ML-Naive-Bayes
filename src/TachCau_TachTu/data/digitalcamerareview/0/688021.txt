		<Content>I have tried to change settings and no matter what I do when I open an image in paint shop pro I can only get 180 dpi in the original image. Is there a way to get at least 300 dpi off the camera? I bought this camera because I am an artist and am trying to get high res photos of my paintings. I have been fighting with this for a long time and would really appreciate some advice. Thanks! Lynne</Content>
