		<Content>Hi Gurus, I have taken a lot of pictures using the camera Canon SX 110 IS, but I cannot remember which attributes I used to capture those pictures. Is there any way that I could get this information from the pictures in the camera? Or do I have to note down the settings that we change/make when taking a shot? Please reply, much appreciated and thanks in advance, Suresh.</Content>
