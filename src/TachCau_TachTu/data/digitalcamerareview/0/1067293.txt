		<Content>I got a Canon Rebel Xti for my birthday and admittedly don't know much about it. I keep jamming up my photo program when I try to download pictures from the camera. The pictures are very large when downloaded. Is there a setting on the camera to reduce the size of the photos? Thanks so much! binkie</Content>
