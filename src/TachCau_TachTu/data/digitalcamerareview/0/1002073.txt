		<Content>I just bought an SD1200 IS (my wife wanted an ultra compact), and I find the image quality to be horrendous. Printing out 4x6s with minimal cropping produces extreme pixelation. I previously used the Canon A620 (7.1MP) and loved the quality of the images, so I trusted moving to the SD1200. Anyone have any ideas why the images are so poor? The reviews all throughout the web rate this a a great camera and one that produces top images. I am not seeing it. I do have the camera set to auto, and the file format to large (full 10MP file). Please help!</Content>
