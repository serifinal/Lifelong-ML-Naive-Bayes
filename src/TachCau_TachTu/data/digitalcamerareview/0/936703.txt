		<Content>When I use "high speed burst" and shoot a half-dozen photos, then look at the pictures, only the first picture is shown. I switched "Group Images" to "Off." I downloaded the photos to iPhoto and only the first photo of each burst downloads. I read the manual and followed the steps but I can't get this feature to work. Any suggestions?</Content>
