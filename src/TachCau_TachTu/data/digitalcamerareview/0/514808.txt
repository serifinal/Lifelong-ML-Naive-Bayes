		<Content>Whenever I'm using the video function, it only allows me to record just over 2 minutes of footage and then I get a 'flashing hand' warning sign and the camera aves what I've recorded. Frustrating if I'm at a gig recording a song. Is there something I need to change with the settings?</Content>
