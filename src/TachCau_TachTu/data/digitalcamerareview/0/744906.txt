		<Content>Kodak has announced the new V Series of cameras. The Kodak EasyShare V550 and Kodak EasyShare V530 are smaller than a deck of playing cards and available in multiple colors, "designed for trendsetters who seek high-style, compact personal electronics that combine phenomenal quality, performance and simplicity." The V Series cameras will be showcasing some new technology that allows a better integration of the video and still modes of a camera. They will be the first to allow still pictures to be captured from a video. Movies can be captured at VGA (640x480) quality at 30 frames per second and are MPEG4 encoded. Also included is image stabilization and the ability to zoom in at real-time on your subjects while shooting a movie. The cameras feature Schnedier Kreuznach lenses and a large LCD viewable at a high angle. Also included is the Kodak EasyShare Frame Dock 2 which allows a one-touch transfer to an attached computer, charges the camera, and displays the LCD in such a way to allow easy viewing of slideshows and videos. Kodak EasyShare V550 The V550 is a 5 megapixel camera that comes in either silver or black and blue luminescent indicator lights. The 2.5 inch, 230,000 pixel LCD, viewable to 170 degress allows easy viewing of your shots, taken with the Schneider Kreuznach C-Variogon 3x optical zoom lens. The V550 will include 19 shooting modes. The EasyShare V550 will be available in June at an MSRP of $399. Kodak EasyShare V530 The V530 also captures images at 5 megapixels, but comes in four colors: Absolute Pink, Red Shimmer, Midnight Black, and Silver Essence. The LCD is a 2 inch high resolution screen and the camera has 3x optical zoom. The EasyShare V530 will be available in July 2005 at an MSRP of $349.</Content>
