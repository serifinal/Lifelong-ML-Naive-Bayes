		<Content>Any advice guys would be appreciated. Camera is 1.2 years old. Flash error occurs when in flash mode (lighting bolt flashes). When flash is not used, camera works. I called Canon and the A$$ said I could trade it in for a refurbished unit for $195. Any ideas on fix or flash replacement?</Content>
