		<Content>I recently got a Canon SD 600. While it takes great close-up photos using the Macro Digital feature, my photos of fast-moving objects is less than great. I attempted to photograph aircraft departing but each photo blurred. I am unable to set shutter speed. Also, the shutter lag caused me to miss several shots, although I set it on continuous shooting. Any advice?</Content>
