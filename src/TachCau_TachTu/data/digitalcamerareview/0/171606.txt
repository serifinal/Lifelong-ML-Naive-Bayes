		<Content>I got a D50 for Christmas and I love the camera -except one thing: I cant figure out how to turn the LCD on or off. Shouldnt the LCD turn on when you depress the shutter half way? There has to be a way to have the LCD screen on while you're shooting. Ive poured over the manual and cant seem to find the answer. HELP!</Content>
