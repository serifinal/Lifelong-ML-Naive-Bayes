		<Content>(and also probably last impressions, the camera's going to be with me for only one day) Well, it's small. Really small. Looks like a toy but it's a little more than that... Image & lens quality: Image quality is good. However, it suffers quite badly from vignetting... as per my post about another IXUS model: SD850 IS (EU: Ixus 950 IS) Blurry Corners And also from a significant amount of pincushion distortion at the wide angle end. I suspect that's what you get from making a 28-mm lens that is perhaps 1.5 cm in diameter... there's no going around that. And also, the fact that it's 28-mm means that applying just a little bit of zoom will get 35mm of image while the vignetting and distortion will be mostly gone (I might be wrong about this though). Image quality is typical from Canon: quite good. A lot of ISO noise at >= 400, again to be expected on such a small camera (I think sensor size is 1/2.5 but I won't check right now). Interface: buttons are sort of minimalistic. Just three ****-modes accessible through direct switch: auto/manual, scene, and hardware. For the rest, you need to use the menus. The manual mode is actually semi-manual: you can control the ISO (which is good on a camera with so much noise on high ISO settings). You can't control exposure or aperture AFAI can tell. DirectPrint button can be reconfigured, but its functions are quite limited. I'd have liked for instance a sub-mode selector (replacing the menu access). Oh yeah I forgot there is the rotating knob, which is actually not rotating, but relying on pressure sensors underneath to detect rotation. Which makes it pretty unreliable. Especially if you have big fingers (and I don't have big fingers). I suppose you could get SOME functionality out of it once you get used to it, but it'll still be a pain, so I expect most users will just end up using the menus. Build & Looks OK. But for some reason I liked the SD850 IS better. Maybe it's because it was fully silver. This one has black accents. Good build, I suppose. Haven't dropped it. Screen Gorgeous and huge. Basically all the back of the camera is taken by it, 3 inches of it. No viewfinder. Performance Reasonably fast. One mention: there are some 3 to 5 seconds in-between taking shots with the flash when the batt is fully charged; so that may become a problem as the battery gets discharged. Writing is fast enough. Reading lags when you scroll through 8MP photos fast (i.e. without waiting more than 1 second at a photo). It does pre-fetch though (one or two photos in advance and backwards), so if you really look at those photos you won't feel the reading times. Flash reaches quite far, by the way, for such a small camera it's alright (at least 5 meters I would say at mid-ISO settings). Anything else? I don't think so. Nice camera. Personally I'd still go for something a bit bigger though, without the image quality compromises.</Content>
