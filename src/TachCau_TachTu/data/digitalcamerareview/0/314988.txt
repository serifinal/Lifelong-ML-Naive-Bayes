		<Content>In an announcement early this morning, Olympus unveiled the presumed successor to its SP-560 18x ultra-zoom: the 20x, 10.0 megapixel SP-570 UZ. Offering a level of manual control rivaling that found on a DSLR and a 35mm-equivalent zoom range of 26mm to 520mm, the SP-570 sports a large 2.7-inch HyperCrystal LCD display with a wide viewing angle, an external flash hotshoe, and a unique bezel-ring zoom control. Dual Image Stabilization, combining ISO boost and sensor-shifting technologies, shows up on the new model, as does a sequential high-speed shooting mode capable of capturing up to 13.5 frames per second at 3 megapixels.As noted, the SP-570 UZ, which captures both RAW and JPEG images, features SLR-like full manual control, including aperture and shutter priority modes. Likewise, the new model carries over the Olympus TruePic III image processor from Olympus's DSLR line. The camera also comes equipped with 31 scene modes and fully automatic operation for straight-up point-and-shoot usability.Expected features like face detection and Olympus's Perfect Shot Preview system also make an appearance on this flagship model. The SP-570's Shadow Adjustment Technology provides on-board dynamic range compensation, bringing out detail and definition in underexposed areas without overexposing highlights, and with a maximum ISO of 6400 the SP-570 has the specs, at least, to perform well in low light.The SP-570 UZ will be available in March, for a suggested price of around $499.99.
