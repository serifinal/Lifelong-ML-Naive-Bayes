		<Content>Adding to their slim T line of digital cameras, Sony has announced the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T10 digital camera. While not as fully spec'ed as the previously announced T30, the T10 is also coming in about $100 less. In addition to the more attractive sticker price, the T10 will be available in four colors: pink, white, black and silver. The T10 will be available in August for around $400.

The GPS-CS1 will be available next month for around $150. Sony Cybershot DSC-T10 The T10 provides 7.2 megapixels of resolution. A 2.5 inch LCD with 230K pixels provides a slightly smaller, but same resolution screen as the T30. The Carl Zeiss lens has a 3x optical zoom with a 35mm equivalent focal length of 38-114mm. Another great feature is Sony's Super SteadyShot image stabilization system. In addition to the optical image stabilization, the T10 can shoot at sensitivities up to ISO 1000, allowing for faster shutter speeds to capture moving subjects. As far as battery life, Sony claims that the T10 will get 250 shots (CIPA standards), which is quite bit less than the 420 shots that the T30 is supposed to get. The T10 does have 56MB of internal memory and accepts Memory Stick Duo (and Pro Duo) media. Full press release (Word doc) Sony GPS-CS1 GPS Receiever In another global announcement, Sony has introduced the GPS-CS1 GPS receiver. By matching up the time stamps on your images with the GPS log from the GPS-CS1, the included GPS Image Tracker software can attach a latitude and longitude to each image. (view large image) Using the Picture Motion Browser software that has been bundled with Sony cameras and camcorders since July, each tagged image can become a "pushpin" on a map. The mapping website, with maps provided by Google Maps, can show you where you've been when you had taken a particular picture. The 3.5 inch long, 2 ounce GPS-CS1 comes with a handy carabiner to attach it easily to a backpack or belt loop. A supplied USB cable allows you to download the GPS log to your computer. Look for the GPS-CS1 next month (September) for around $150.</Content>
