		<Content>The Kodak Easyshare V705 is the latest dual lens camera from Kodak. They have two versions, one that does ultra-wide (this one and the V570) and a version that does the long zoom (Kodak Easyshare V610). The 7.1 megapixel V705 is essentially a resolution upgrade from the 5 megapixel V570 that came out at the beginning of this year. (view large image) I'm in the middle of a full review of the V705, but wanted to do a little teasing and let you know whats coming until I get it completed. Look for the full review within a couple weeks. The V705 looks pretty much exactly the same as the V570, except that it's now available in black, silver, and pink. I got the more readily available black model for the review. It still has a 2.5 inch, 230K pixel LCD. The dual lenses are covered by a sliding metal cover that makes a fun metallic sliding sound as it moves. The dual lenses are paired with two identical 7.1 megapixel sensors. (view large image) Given the entire focal length range of the camera, it boasts a 5x optical zoom. However, this can be a little misleading since, without digital zoom, there is a blank spot of focal length that is "between" the two lenses. One lens provides a fixed focal length that is the 35mm equivalent of a 23mm lens. The other lens provides the equivalent of 39-117mm. So, the space between 23mm and 39mm is not covered by optics. If you turn on digital zoom, this space is "covered". I'm pleased with the speed of camera operation and having a wide angle lens. Another thing that I've liked that Kodak includes in many of their cameras is the orientation sensor. When it is enabled, you don't have to actually rotate portrait oriented images after you transfer them to your computer. I have noticed some issues getting the camera to focus sometimes, but I need to spend some more time with it. Also, I've had poor results at the telephoto end of the zoom, but again, it may be related to the focus or some other user error on my part. I will be sure to update my findings in the full review. Overall, it's a fun camera with a fun size. Having a nice wide angle lens in a camera this size is perfect for a real estate agents who are always on the go. It's perfect for taking shots of large groups so everyone makes it into the frame. Here's one sample image: (view medium image) (view large image)</Content>
