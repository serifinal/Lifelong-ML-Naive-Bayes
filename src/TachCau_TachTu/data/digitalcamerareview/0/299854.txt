		<Content>Hi.. I installed ZoomBrowser EX version 6 from the CD that came with the camera. It installed perfectly, but when i run it, it gives me a "critical error". Am i supposed to open zoombrowser with the camera attached even if i've already transferred the pictures on my hdd or is this a version compatibility problem..?? Thanks</Content>
