		<Content>Saw this combo kit on ebay for my S5 IS ,the price is definitely right,I'm a little leery about the quality though. I emailed the seller for the brand name but I haven't heard back yet. Anybody have one or know of them? here's a link. http://cgi.ebay.ca/Lens-Accessory-Co...713.m153.l1262</Content>
