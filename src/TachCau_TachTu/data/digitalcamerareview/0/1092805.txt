While being offered as an entry-level digital SLR, the Rebel XT outperforms some of its more expensive rivals. Kai Thon, DIWA's test manager says: "With the EOS 350D, Canon has refined the successful pioneer and predecessor, the EOS 300D, by improving all the imperfect details pointed out by DIWA. Both the new 8.2 Megapixel CMOS sensor, similar to the one used in the Gold winning semi-professional EOS 20D and the remarkable DIGIC II image processor. Our extensive scoreboard gave results surprisingly close to those of the EOS 20D, revealing no major construction concerns. DIWA experts from Europe and USA agreed that the EOS 350D elevates the "Amateur D-SLR" class pleasantly close to professional cameras, at a fraction of the price." http://www.letsgodigital.org/en/news/articles/story_3191.html</Content>
