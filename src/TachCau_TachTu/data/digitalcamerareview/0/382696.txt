		<Content>Hi. I just received my new PowerShot SX220 HS , the thing is it came in a plain white box with no lettering or anything on the outside with only an intact silver security seal, when i opened the box my camera was sitting on few pieces of what looked like tissue paper. Now i paid full price for this camera from a large online retailer in the UK, have a received a reconditioned camera? Thanks John.</Content>
