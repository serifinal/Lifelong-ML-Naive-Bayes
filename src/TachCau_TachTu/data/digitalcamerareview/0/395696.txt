Press Release Canon Leads Digital Camera Sales Last Year, Kodak Moves Up According to a report from IDC, Canon had a slim lead in digital camera sales globally last year by being able to capitalized on the demand for higher-end cameras. Canon sold enough cameras to hit 17.1% of the market, Sony has 16.7%, and Kodak had 11.8%. Canon's aggressive pricing on digital SLRs helped open up the demand for the more sophisticated cameras, with many sub-$1000 models avaiable. According to the report, the demand for the digital SLRs was at the cost of demand for "prosumer" models. The other interesting bit from the IDC report was that Kodak leapfrogged over Olympus to take the #3 spot in total sales worldwide. In the US, Kodak topped digital camera sales.

Digital Still Camera Market is "Running out of Steam" According to Strategy Analytics, the demand for camera phones will adversely affect the demand for digital still cameras in the future. Four in 10 mobile phones sold last year included cameras in them for a total of 257 million camera phones, outselling digital cameras four to one. For more, check The Register.</Content>
