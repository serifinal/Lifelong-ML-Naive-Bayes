		<Content>My mom bought a Canon Powershot S5 IS, and shortly after she bought it, the Print/Share button blue light started staying lit constantly, unless the batteries are taken out. Unfortunately, this tends to drain the batteries a lot faster, obviously. Is there a setting to turn that light off when it's not plugged into a printer, or does it need to be serviced? I've searched a lot of places online and can't find any mention of this problem. I even tried plugging the camera into her HP Photosmart printer and printed a photo, but that didn't fix anything. Any help is appreciated. Thanks</Content>
