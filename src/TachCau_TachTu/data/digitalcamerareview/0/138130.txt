		<Content>Digital photo frames are a nice idea, and it makes sense that most households may eventually replace one or more of their "real" photo frames with a digital one. With plenty of frames that display great looking images out there, the bigger problem is often one of frame styling itself. I, for one, am not willing to adorn my living room with a frame that looks like it was built by the Star Trek props department. Unforunately, lots of digital photo frames are still too focused on the gadget, and not enough on style.Imaging company Digital Foci recently announced that their new Image Moments line of digital frames (in 5.7, 8, and 15-inch varieties) will be officially unveiled at the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show in a few weeks. Trimmed in wood or polished metal, these matted image displays are handsomely normal in appearance, and the 8 and 15-inch models allow custom framing and matting as well meaning nearly endless stylistic possibilities.(view large image) All three models feature high-tech screen technology, including LED backlighting on the 5.7-inch Image Moments 6 and 8-inch Image Moments 8, and a 1024x768 XGA display with a 700:1 contrast ratio on the Image Moments 15. Built-in memory card slots support all common memory types, including xD-Picture Card and Memory Stick, with 200 MB of internal memory for photo storage in each model. Image Moments frames can display JPEG, TIFF, BMP, and GIF images, in addition to RAW files from many cameras; support for several video and audio file types is also available.List prices are $149 for the Image Moments 6, $199 for the Image Moments 8, and $399 for the Image Moments 15. Full specifications for each model are listed below.Image Moments 15: 15 XGA (1024x768) digital LCD with 16.2 million colors and high contrast ratio of 700:1 VESA mounting interface for wall and mounting bracketsVideo and Audio input for displaying external video sourcesHinged memory card door hides memory cards from view Unique interchangeable frame & mat design Image Moments 8: 8 SVGA (800x640) digital LCD with high contrast ratio of 500:1Next generation LCD with LED backlight technologyHinged memory card door hides memory cards from view Unique interchangeable frame & mat design Image Moments 6: 5.7" VGA (640x480) digital LCD with high pixel density of 140 PPI Next generation LCD with LED backlight technology Elegant two-tone, mirror-polished chrome finish Small footprint allows for versatile placement General Specifications:200 MB internal memoryBuilt-in stereo speakers Built-in memory card slots: CF, MD, MMC, SD/HC, Memory Stick, MS PRO, MS Duo, MS PRO Duo, xD-Picture Card USB 2.0 connection for transfering images from a computerSupported image file types: JPEG, BMP, TIFF, GIF, certain RAW typesSupported audio file types: MP3, AAC, WMA, OGG, WAVSupported video file types: MJPEG, MPEG-4SPAutomatic photo orientation based on EXIF dataOn-device playback control and file managementAutomatic on/off timer</Content>
