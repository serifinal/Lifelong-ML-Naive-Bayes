		<Content>Greetings to all...Just a basic question (I guess) I have a Canon IXUS 850IS and I'm loving it. My question is this, is the canon utilities software comes with the feature in which we can shrink the size of the picture? I tried to mess around with it, but to no avail any advice is much appreciated..Thanks in advance...</Content>
