		<Content>Olympus has announced four new digital cameras in their weatherproof Stylus line. The Olympus Stylus 730, Stylus 740, Stylus 750, and Stylus 1000 all feature the good looks and weatherproof (water resistant) that the Stylus line is known for. However, a new 5x optical zoom lens system and CCD-shift image stabilization have found their way into the line. Olympus has developed a sliding lens system that allows the camera to stay slim while providing a nice 5x optical zoom. The new lens allows the camera to be less than 1 inch thick. For the first time in Stylus line, Olympus has included a CCD-shift image stabilization system in the Olympus Stylus 750. A dedicated processor controls the mechanism that minimizes image blur.
