		<Content>Hi there I just bought a Powershot 4500 and I use the Camera Window programm to download pictures onto my hard drive. The problem is, when I connect by USB, it doesnt give me the option to start up Camera Window. I need to manually open the program (through start --> program) in order to download. Is there a way to have the computer connect via usb to the camera and have the pop-up show the Camera Window program? Thanks!</Content>
