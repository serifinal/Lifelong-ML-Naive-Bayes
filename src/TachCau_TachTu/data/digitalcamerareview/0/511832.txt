		<Content>5 months ago i bought a Canon EOS 50D body to complement the EOS 20D i already had for its larger raw image size; i have used the same lens(EF70-200 F4L USM) on both bodies, but can't seem to duplicate the 20D's image sharpness with the 50D even with mirror lockup & RS-80N3 remote switch on both bodies using a very stable Bogen tripod. The 20D just keeps exhibiting a sharper image regardless of the subject; i am interested if anyone else has encountered a similar situation or could offer a solution.</Content>
