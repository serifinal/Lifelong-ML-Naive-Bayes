		<Content>My director used the Canon again for the next video that we shot. This time we added a moving dolly and other stands to hold and maneuver the camera so that the angles would be more interesting. The lens he used was a Canon 16-35mm f2.8L. I rented it from Samy's for about $35. I need feedback, please Please note that there's rapping in the song YouTube - &#x202a;Damozel - "Take A Picture" The Remix&#x202c;&rlm;</Content>
