		<Content>Just wondering if there is anything I can do about fuzzy video. I bought the camera partly to get better video than my way old Kodak Easyshare (2 mp and 15fps) but this isn't. When I pause the playback movement is blurred, even with recording HD at 30fps. Anyone else notice this and is there some setting that will sharpen up the video?</Content>
