		<Content>I bought a used Canon Rebel XT SLR that is about 3 or 4 years old that has taken about 5000 pictures by now. My model looks shorter and wider than in real life. Do I need a different lens ( I currently have a EFS 18-55mm)? It also seems to exaggerate this outcome when I turn it sideways.</Content>
