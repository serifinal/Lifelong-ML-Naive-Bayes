		<Content>I purchased a Canon Powershot SD1300 digital camera a couple of days ago. I've taken some lovely pictures with it, and I'm enjoying it very much. A strange thing happens with the video though. The picture is nice and clear (though a wee bit jerky) and the sound is very good, but the two things don't match up: the picture lags a little behind the sound. Is this something I can fix, or is it just the way this particular camera shoots video? Please advise. Thanks, vitaluna</Content>
