		<Content>Hi all! Just got the A570 IS, ordered it from amazon. On the front around the lens there is a plastic donut type thing attached to the body (theres a little button in front you can click to rotate it and take it off, exposing the sides of the lense). This thing is kind of loose on mine. I wanted to check to see if this is true of all A570IS's, or if this is just the case with mine (in which case I should probably return it). What I mean by loose is... it's loose, when you tap it it moves. I'm not sure what function the thing servs, or why it deserves a button to take it off, but its looseness is rather disturbing as it rattles whenever I pick the camera up. Thanks in advance Darunium</Content>
