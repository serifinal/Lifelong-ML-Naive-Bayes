		<Content>I have a Canon SD850 with 8GB SDHC card and am trying to record video for more than 60 minutes. I currently have my movie mode set at 320x240 @ 15 fps, and the display says I can record 272 min 45 sec. However when I press record the most I ever get is 60 min. Anybody else notice this problem?</Content>
