		<Content>Hi Folks, I've got the IXUS 950 IS (aka SD850 IS) & whenever I use the in built red eye correction function I'm unable to copy the photos from the camera. Has anyone also encountered this or better yet have a solution for this? Alternatively, as a work around can anyone suggest some software for reducing/removing red eye from photos? PS. I'm using a genuine 4gb SanDisk SDHC card. Thanks.</Content>
