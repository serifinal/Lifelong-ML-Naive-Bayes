		<Content>Hi, I bought a new Canon SX110IS 2 weeks ago. When placing my fully charged energizer NiMH 2500mAh batteries in it, I get the low battery signal right away. When placing the same batteries in my old Sony digital cameras, the battery indicator shows they are fully charged... Is this a problem with my Canon or the batteries?</Content>
