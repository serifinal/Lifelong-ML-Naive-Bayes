		<Content>Hi my online research tells me that all those black dots on my images are dust on the sensor and it is cheaper to just buy a new one rather than sending it in for cleaning. I will appreciate any confirmation from experts here. The attached image is zoomed at 3x. Without zooming I get the spot on the right corner only. I feel bad as going through my pics I traced it back to a month before the end of the 1yr warranty. My CC covers the 2yr but canon-canada has to verify this is a job that would have been under warranty.</Content>
