		<Content>Just bought an S5 IS because my S1 didn't have a macro mode. Seems no matter what I try I can't get the 'flower' to show up in the LCD window. I have tried touching the 'flower macro button' on the side of the lens umpteen times. Camera is set in Auto mode.... Have read the manual which seems a little vague using macro so am wondering if I am missing something here. Not only can't I get the flower to show in the LCD monitor...but I really bought this camera because I need it to focus within 2" and was told this camera had a super-macro to do just that. Hoping someone can jump in here to point me in the right direction. Thanks, Liane</Content>
