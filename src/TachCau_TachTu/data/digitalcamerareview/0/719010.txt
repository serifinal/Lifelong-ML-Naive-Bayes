		<Content>I broke the screen of my Powershot SX 110 IS camera and sent it for repair to a specialized lab. I received back the camera with a working screen but the surface is not as pristine as I expected (several scratches). Can anyone tell me if the screen has a protective plastic layer that may have not been changed, or whether the lab installed a used screen (while I paid for anew one?) Many thanks</Content>
