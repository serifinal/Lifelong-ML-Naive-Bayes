		<Content>Hi all! I recently got a new Canon PowerShot SD780 IS as a gift and so far I love it. The only problem I am having is that sometimes it seems as though the images that are printed out are a bit off centered (either side to side or up and down) from what is displayed on the screen. Any idea what could be causing this or how to fix it? I don't know much about the customized settings and always use my camera on the auto options. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks!</Content>
