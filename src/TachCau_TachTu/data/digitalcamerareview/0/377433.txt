		<Content>After opening and closing the sliding battery cover on my Canon SD-600, the cover has become loose. The cover now slides open with just a feather-light touch of a finger. Often, the cover slides open while trying to snap a photo. It would be ridiculous to have it repaired as it's no longer covered by warranty. Any advice to keep it closed while camera is in use? I thought of placing a tape over the cover. Am I the only 1 with this problem? Remember, when the battery cover opens, all power is shut-off, so I've been losing loads of snapshots.</Content>
