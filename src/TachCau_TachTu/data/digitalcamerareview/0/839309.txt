		<Content>I purchased the Canon S2IS in 08/05 and think it takes great pictures. I am having a problem finding a good setting for indoor sports pictures though (the pictures are always blurry). I don't believe there's a "sports" setting. Can anyone tell me what settings would take the best indoor sports photos?</Content>
