		<Content>I was recently looking into the Canon S3 IS and S2 IS Powershot cameras. But I learned they have a camcorder mode that comes with them. I just got a camcorder for Xmas, so I do not need this option with my camera. I really want something with the same abilities and easy to use feel of the S3 and S2. Any tips on a camera out there that fits this description of the S3 and S2 without the camcorder option? I do not want to pay for something I will not use. Thanks for any advice.</Content>
