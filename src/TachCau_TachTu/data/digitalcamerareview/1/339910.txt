		<Content>Recently got this great camera but was told it didn't have another power source other than batteries. Just read in the manual that there is a power adapter CA-PS700. Since I take many of my wildlife pics from inside through a window, a plug in would be great - if it's long enough or can handle an extension cord. I read reviews and it seems like this is what I need, although some reviewers (and one description referred to it as a charger.) Anyone have one and/or know about how long it is? Thanks!!
