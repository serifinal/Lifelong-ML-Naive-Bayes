		<Content>So i'm looking at buying an easy to use point and shoot camera for the family. I'm looking at the Canon sd960is and the Canon sd980is. From what i understand the 980 is the same as the 960 execpt for a touch screen. Has anyone had experience with these cameras and which one do you think i should get? Thanks in advance!</Content>
