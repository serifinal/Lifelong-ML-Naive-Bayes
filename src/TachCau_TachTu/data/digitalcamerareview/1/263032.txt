		<Content>thinking i'm going to go with this camera because it has: 1. high ISO for night time. 1600 2. view finder. the kodak i was looking at had a LCD screen which may be hard to see outside 3. 2 AA batteries. this feature i like the most. no chargeing and i'll always have plenty backup AA on hand 4. under $200 does anybody have any complaints about this camera? thank you.</Content>
