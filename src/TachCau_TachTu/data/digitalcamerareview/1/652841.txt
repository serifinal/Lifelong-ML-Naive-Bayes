		<Content>I am debating between the Canon SD1100 or SD1200. It will be a gift for my ten year old, but I will use it as my backup camera I want something within $200 that has minimal lag time - is there a difference in lag time between these two? I'm wondering if the SD1200 is worth the extra $50.. Thanks.</Content>
