		<Content>I am looking to purchase possibly this camera in the next few days.... I am looking for any comments on this camera that you might have. I am an average photographer who does take regular shots and also sports shots of our son playing baseball -- usually those are just still shots with zoom. We are headed to the beach soon and I want to take some great photo's while there...... **I am in comparrison of this camera and the Fujifile Finepix S1000fd. ~~~Any comments welcome and you can also email me at SuthernRedd@aol.com Thanks for your time =)</Content>
