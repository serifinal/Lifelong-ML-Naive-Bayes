		<Content>My daughter has a Powershot G11 and we were thinking of getting her a protective cover for it, perhaps a filter or two. It bothers my husband that the lens is so exposed. (Our daughter isn't the most conscientious, even with expensive items. Sigh.) I was looking at an Opteka on Amazon (3 for $25) . Would this work as indicated or would I need extra equipment. (I am not sure I would need to get an adapter tube, for instance.) Feedback anyone. Thanks</Content>
