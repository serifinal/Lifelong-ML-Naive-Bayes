		<Content>I've owned this camera for a week or so and am half tempted to return it. At first, it seemed like an awesome camera for the price. Outdoors, it works GREAT! Some of the best photos I've ever taken. Inside, is another story. No matter how many lights are on in my house, it insists I use the flash. It can be bright as can be and the photos still turn out blurry (without the flash). I took the camera to a wrestling event last week and some of my pictures were great (using flash, of course) but the amount of time it took for the flash to recharge was tremendous. I also got very irritated when the zoom started to 'freeze' up. Is this common for the SX110 or do I have a bad camera? I was taking a lot of photos, but the battery was nowhere near being dead so I couldn't even blame it on that. Also, there have been numerous times when the auto-focus green box would NOT appear on my screen, nor would it allow me to take a photo without it, even with the button being pressed down entirely. Very frustrating! Now, it won't allow me to use digital zoom any longer. I haven't checked the manual yet but when I go into the menu, it skips right over the option for digital zoom.. doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Perhaps I've screwed up a setting somewhere along the way. Needless to say, I didn't spend $220+ to only be able to take outdoor shots. Do you think I have a camera with a glitch or are these problems common with all Powershot SX110's? My friend's brother recently purchased the Kodak Easyshare ZD8612 from Wal-Mart for under $200, and it has a higher optical zoom as well as megapixels. I'm half tempted to purchase that in place of the Canon SX110. Any thoughts? Opinions? I'm at my wits end..</Content>
