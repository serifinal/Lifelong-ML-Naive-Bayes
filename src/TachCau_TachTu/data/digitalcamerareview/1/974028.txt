		<Content>I am having a tough time deciding between these two. The IS 2 is $150 cheaper than the S3 however I love the black color of the S3. Any opionions? I know the color is a stupid reason but I like the black color ALOT better than the silver color. Do you think its worth $150 to get the S3? Thanks</Content>
