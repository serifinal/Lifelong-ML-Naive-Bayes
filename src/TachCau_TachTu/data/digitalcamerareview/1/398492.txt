		<Content>Any idea how the pictures from these two camera compare specially indoors using flash? Both of them have 4x zoom and same 35mm range. I know that they are of different size and price range and both are among the best in their categories but I want to know if 590 will take better pictures than 850 under the same conditions.</Content>
