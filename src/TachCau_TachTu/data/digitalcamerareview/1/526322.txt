		<Content>Hello, I am thinking to get a Canon Rebel xsi (aka 450D). Is this a good camera for taking fast moving pictures? My girl does gymnastic. When using my regular point and shoot camera, I rarely have a picture that is no blurred. Based on what I have read so far, I think Canon might able to meet my requirement. But I still want to hear your advice. Also, I am looking for the cheapest (and trustworthy) place to get one in Canada or US. I am thinking to get the kit with two lens. Your comments are welcome!
