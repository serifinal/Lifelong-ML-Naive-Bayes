		<Content>Hi, I have owned a S410 ELPH for N* years. I have up to 4G compact flash cards, 3 batteries, and a pouch for it. I could feel it is getting to its end of life. (I hate to replace it because it could still take great pictures, but buttons are not really working!!) I do not want to invest any more on the accessories or gadgets, but I think I need a new camera. Do you know which other newer model (Canon preferred) takes CF card? Thanks a lot. - vanessa</Content>
