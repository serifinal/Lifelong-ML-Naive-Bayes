		<Content>I am thinking of getting an S3 IS. I have a couple of questions How long is the battery life, I will be getting rechargeable but do not want to have to carry a ton of them with me? What is the max size of memory card it can take Has anyone tried to use it in the inside, I will be going to Disney world and want to attempt to use it on some of the rides, without a flash At high zooms is there a lot of noise, what about when going into the digital zoom are Does a gorilla pod work nicely with this or is there a better tripod to carry with me</Content>
