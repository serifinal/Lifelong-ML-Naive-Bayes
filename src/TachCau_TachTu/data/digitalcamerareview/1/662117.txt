		<Content>Well I'm going to pick up my camera this weekend, I really can't decide between these 2 cameras...is the 970 really worth the extra money? Which of the 2 has the wider lens? I read both reviews, but I'm not sure how to tell. ...well any input anyone can provide on these 2 cameras (Most likely Andy) is greatly appreciated.</Content>
