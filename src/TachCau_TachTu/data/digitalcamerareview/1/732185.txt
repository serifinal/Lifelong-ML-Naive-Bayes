		<Content>I am camera shopping. A friend recommended the Canon SD1300. I read about it on Canon's website. The operating humidity range of the SD 1300 is 10 - 90%. That gave me some concern. So, I called their tech support and the D10 (waterproof rated) was suggested. It costs more and is bulkier, but can be used underwater up to 33 ft. Impressive right? Although, I don't do underwater photography, surely it must be suited for all moisture environments above ground. Right? ---wrong! When I read their specs on this model, they limited it also to 10 - 90% Operating Humidity. This is the very same limitation as for the SD1300. This prompted me to call tech support to ask if this was a mistake--perhaps a misprint. The answer I got was that "humidity" refers to above ground use, as opposed to underwater use. The tech guy did not have me convinced that he really knew what he was talking about in this regard. So, I redialed and got another. The second guy seemed more assured with his answer. But his answer was basically the same as the first. And when I asked him specifically if the D10 (which waterproof rated) was in a foggy environment (e.g. Coast Redwoods) would it provide a higher level of protection than the SD 1300. He said, "No". He said it would be subject to the humidity environmental limitations as the SD 1300. Apparently, although the D10 is specially protected against water, even water under a certain degree of pressure, it is not from water vapor. I am surprised by this. So a question for you outdoor camera buffs: What ?point and shoot? camera is good for both rainy and foggy environments. Thanks</Content>
