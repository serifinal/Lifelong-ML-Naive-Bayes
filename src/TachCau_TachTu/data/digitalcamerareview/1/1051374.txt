		<Content>Hi Everyone I am trying to decide which of the Canon Powershot models to buy, either the A710 or A720. The only thing I am not sure of is whether it is possible to use the ZOOM lens feature in MOVIE mode on the A720is, as I know you can on the A710? Does anyone know the answer to this query for me? Thanks to all who respond. Brian</Content>
