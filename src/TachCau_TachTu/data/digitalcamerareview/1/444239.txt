		<Content>Hi I bought a Canon Sd 850 IS with a 2 GB external memory card in Oct 2007. When I bought the camera, I was told that the memory was expandable till 2 GB. I plan to buy an additional memory card. I wanted to know whether a 4 GB or an 8 Gb memory card work with this camera. My trip begins thursday evening...So please respond fast! Thanks in advance</Content>
