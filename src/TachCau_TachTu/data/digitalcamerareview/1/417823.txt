		<Content>Hey guys, I'm new to this forum, I'm not that good at taking pictures, but I do want to replace my Olympus FE-180 to a Canon a570is, I been reading reviews on here, and other sites as well. Well basically I want a camera that take good pictures at night, day, indoors, and out doors, as well as my kid, I'm just leaning about cameras so I don't really know to much, I just want some of you guys thoughts about this camera Thanks</Content>
