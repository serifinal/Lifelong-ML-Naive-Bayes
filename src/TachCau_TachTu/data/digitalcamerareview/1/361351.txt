		<Content>I'm in the market for a camera and I have my eyes set on a A570 IS. And while shopping around I came across this deal at walmart. Is it a good deal? I really do need a new printer, I have both a separate printer/scanner taking up space on my desk, so I'm considering getting this to replace the two. The photo paper is icing on the cake too.</Content>
