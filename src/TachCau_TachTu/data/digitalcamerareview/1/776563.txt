		<Content>Hi There all, I have a question about something of an odd comparison. I've got an A570IS which I am very happy with, at the price point the quality of the images is excellent. I'm thinking now of upgrading, however, to a G series P&S (either g7, g9, or g10). I'm still looking for something that will fit in a pocket and has as good image quality I can get, while of course considering the various pricepoints. Now in looking at images from all of the cameras in the g9 and g10 there are obvious improvements over not just the A570 but also the g7, possibly due to the larger sensors but I think more likely due to the new processing system, there are really noticeable improvements in both washout situations (which I've noticed is a problem in my A570 and have seen is an issue in comparative g7 photos) as well as in noise handling at high ISOs (this one's really clear in comparative photos, and is important for indoor, flash-free shots which I take a lot of, but I wondering if the noise handling could just as easily be replicated in photoshop with some blurring or unsharp masking). My primary question is, how dramatic are the improvements of the g7 over the A570? I've found it hard to find comparative photos between the two. I know the washout and noise are still a problem with the g7, but how do they compare to the A570? I imagine the WB is the same so washout wouldn't be helped at all. When I bought the A570, the g7 was still at the 500USD pricepoint, where I found its improvements negligible compared to the cost, but at its reduced prices two years later, I wonder what the upgrade from the A570 to g7 is now worth. Thanks in advance for any advise, Darunium</Content>
