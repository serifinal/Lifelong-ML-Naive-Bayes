		<Content>Hey there, I have a big problem. I destroyed my camera completely it was one of those slim digital cameras and now I am in desperate need of a new one, but I decided to buy a bigger, more professional one for my traveling to Paris. I found several Canon's on the internet but I just can't decide which one I should buy, above all, because I do not have the slightest clue which camera is good and which one simply is not. There are several single lens reflex canon eos cameras, but I do not know, because I am an absolute technical failure.</Content>
