		<Content>I just got my S5 IS and I'm looking for a 4GB non-SDHC card for it, so that I can put it into my Samsung i730 Pocket PC phone when I'm on the go if I want to upload photos to the web or send them to my home computer. I'm looking for quality and something that's inexpensive of course. http://dcresource.pricegrabber.com/s.../sortby=priceA The TopRam card on there seems to be the least expensive 150X model, but I need to know user opinions on it first. I suppose if they have a good warranty policy then that might affect my decision as well, but I want to get this right the first time of course. I think between $30-$40 is about as much as I'd be willing to spend on an SD card. Also, I want the build quality to be good. I have an A-Data 4GB 150X regular SD card, but it's starting to fall apart from ejecting in and out of my i730. I don't know if it's a design problem with all SD cards or what and the plastic breaks over time if you're not just "super careful" when inserting and removing the card. Anyway, that's about all I can think of right now. Let me know, thanks!</Content>
