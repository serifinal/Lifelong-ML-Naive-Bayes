		<Content>I'm considering purchasing this camera because I have read so many wonderful reviews. I do have a question and was hoping I could get some input from actual owners. I read in a review (on another site) that transferring pictures from the camera to a computer with Windows XP is difficult. I believe they were having a problem with the software and haven't been able to find any help. So.... my question is if any of you know of such a problem and if it has been fixed? I would hate to buy the camera and then not be able to transfer photos Thanks for any input!!</Content>
