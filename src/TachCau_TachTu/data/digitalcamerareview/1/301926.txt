		<Content>I'm planning to get the Canon SD800IS and have a question about how durable digital cameras are. I plan to use the camera for family photos and vacations, but occasionally will take it with me when I ride my dirt bike. It will be kept inside a backpack with padding around it. Will the bouncing around that takes place riding an offroad motorcycle cause any problems with a digital camera?</Content>
