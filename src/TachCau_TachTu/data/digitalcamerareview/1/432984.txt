		<Content>Hello, I have a Canon Rebel XS and I'm currently looking into getting a tripod and eventually looking into buying a lens. I wanted someone's opinion on what would be the best. Lens- I do a lot of outdoor and a little indoor. I read the Lens Buyers Guide and wasn't sure which one exactly I should lean towards more. Tripod- I read about a brand called Velbon. I seen on another forum that they had highly recommended it. I would like other's opinion on what they think that would be best.</Content>
