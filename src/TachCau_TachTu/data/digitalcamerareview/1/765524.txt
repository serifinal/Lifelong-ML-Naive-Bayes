		<Content>Dear all I want to buy a ultracompact camera soon and some of my candidates are the SD850IS or SD950IS. Does anyone know whether there is a battery charger available that can be used in a car by connecting it to the cigrarette lighter? or, can anyone please tell me what DC voltage and current the included charger delivers that I can build my onw charger for the car? Thanks for any hints regards Sektionschef</Content>
