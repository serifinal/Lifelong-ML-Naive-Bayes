		<Content>im new to all this and i thought i would take up photography as a new hobbie, i recently bought a canon eos slr 1000d camera. and have taken some reasonable pictures with it, i took it to my daughters football match to take some pictures of it. the pictures are ok but not as close as i had hoped, unfortunatly all the match was played at the other side from which i was stood. what lens do i need to make sure i can get closer photos for next time, please help as im loving my new hobby but just want to get it right thanks</Content>
