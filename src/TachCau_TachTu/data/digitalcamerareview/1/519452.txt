		<Content>Hi all, My first post here is a question. So back in 2006 I bought a Canon SD700IS and it has been the cornerstone of dependability, quality, and shooting speed, so much so that I have not needed to upgrade in all these years. In 2008 my dad wanted to dive into digital cameras and I told him to just get one of the SD Powershots and he would be OK. Well he ended up getting a Canon SD1100IS and its performance has been dismal. The main negative is that it has a very slow shooting speed. I looked it up and it turns out that it is a few seconds slower than the 700. Canon SD700IS Digital ELPH Review Canon SD1100 IS Digital ELPH Review: 9. Performance: Digital Photography Review 1.8 sec (w/700) vs 3.2 sec (w/1100) with the flash on. The second issue is that the image quality is highly lacking. In some pics, there will be a purple outline surrounding a person's head. It only happens sometimes and in lower-light conditions. So fast forward to today. My dad only takes pics of his grandchildren and I can attest to the fact that kids are very fast and move quickly. It is important that pictures can be taken at the speed of my 700 or better. So as a Christmas gift, which SD should I go for? I looked on Wiki and saw that there seemed to be different naming conventions that might designate a different class/family of SD Powershots Canon Digital IXUS - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia So which would be the "newest" version of my old school SD700IS? Or an explanation of the different families would be helpful. Currently the SD1400IS is on sale for a good price but I have a feeling that it is just an upgraded version of the SD1100IS and if so I'll pass on that.</Content>
