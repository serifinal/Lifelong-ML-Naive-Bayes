		<Content>I just was about to order a canon sx10 si when the salesperson asked if I wanted the US or Eruopean version. I asked the difference and he said the instruction book. He also said the difference in cost is $350+ for US and $264 for the Eruopean. It sounds fishy to me and can't find anything on google. Anyone have information on US vs European versions??
