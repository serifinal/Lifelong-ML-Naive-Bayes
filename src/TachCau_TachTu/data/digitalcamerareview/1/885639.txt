		<Content>Hi I'm looking to buy a new canon lense for sports photography (mostly outside moving shots like athletics). I'd like a zoom capacity for distance and I'm thinking 70-200mm. I'm not sure whether to go image stabilizing or f/2.8 as both in one lense is a little too expensive for me at the moment. Someone suggested 70-200 f/4 L would be good. Does anyone have any advice? I have a 24-70mm f/2.8L which I love at the moment.</Content>
