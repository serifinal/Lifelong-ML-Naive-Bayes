		<Content>Hi all I have an old Canon EOS500N Film SLR Camera with EF 28-80mm USM lens. I am now interested in buying a DSLR and was looking at Canon EOS1000D or Canon EOS450D. I understand that both EOS1000D and EOS450D can take EF and EF-S lenses. However, what I wanted to know was that by using the EF 28-80mm USM lens, will I lose any functionality? Also, is it important / better to get an IS lens? Many thanks for your answers.</Content>
