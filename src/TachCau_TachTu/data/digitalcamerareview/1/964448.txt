		<Content>Hi guys, A few weeks back I posted about possibly replacing my 17-85mm Canon lens, but I've decided to keep it after all. I've really been looking closely at the Canon 50mm f/1.4 lens, which seems to have very positive reviews. Anyone have first-hand experiences or comments about this lens? It is about $399 where I get it here in Vancouver, Canada!</Content>
