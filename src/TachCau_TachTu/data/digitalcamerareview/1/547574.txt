		<Content>Hello, I am looking to purchase my first digital camera, and after doing some research I have decided to buy a camera from Canon's Powershot line. My question is this: given very average needs, which is a better buy: the A710 model at around $105 or the A570 model at around $145 I am not really sure how much changed between the two cameras, but the A710 seems to be the better deal? If you could give me any suggestions I would be grateful. Thank you! Ryan</Content>
