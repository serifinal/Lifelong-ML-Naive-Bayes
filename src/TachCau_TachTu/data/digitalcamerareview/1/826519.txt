		<Content>After reading review after review I went and held the Canon 50D with a 28-135mm lens. I must say I like the feel of it. Very well built I feel. I think I am going to take the plunge and buy one, I just am not sure what the best len would be for it. I like to shoot outdoor photography- Sporting events- Any advice on lenses would be great. Thanks in advance, Mike O.</Content>
