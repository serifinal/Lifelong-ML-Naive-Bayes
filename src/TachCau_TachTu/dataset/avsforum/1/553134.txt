sam hl-61a750 vs sam hl-t6176s would you swap the 6176 for the 61a750 .
i am thinking about swapping my 6176s for the 61a750 , which has a better pic ?
the 6176s has a great picture but it does have slight bowing , does hte 750 have this problem ?
does the 750 have all of the features of the 6176s ?
also what is the diff between the 750 and the 650 ?
thanks
