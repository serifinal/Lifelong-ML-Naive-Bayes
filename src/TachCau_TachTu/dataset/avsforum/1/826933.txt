recommendations for 150 " power screen please .
i am moving my projector ( panasonic ae2000u ) to a larger room , now looking for a large ( 150 " diagonal or marginally smaller ) power retractable screen ( ceiling - mounted ) .
this will be my first screen , as so far i was just projecting on a wall .
looking for suggestions on brand / model / fabric / etc. .
thanks !
