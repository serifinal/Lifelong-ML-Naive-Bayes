yamaha 663 or pioneer vsx 1018thx - k ? .
i was ready to buy the onkyo 605 but now see these two new models on the horizon for about the same price .
i see a lot of excitement around the yamaha in the forums but from the looks of the specs the pioneer looks like a better possible choice for only $ 50 more .
what do the experts think ?
