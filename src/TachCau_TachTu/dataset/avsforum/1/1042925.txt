home theater seating from stargate cinema ? .
stargate cinema has a sale offering free shipping on all of their seating through the next few days , and i found a sectional there that i really like .
their price is several hundred dollars less than what i 've found for the same -lrb- or similar -rrb- set on all other websites , as most charge around $ 1700 - $ 1800 but do not include the ottoman or shipping .
i 've also looked at the local furniture stores and outlets and every configuration similar to this is far and away more expensive .
so i guess what i 'm asking is , has anyone purchased furniture from this company ?
should i expect a lesser build quality for the price ?
i 'm a little nervous about buying such an expensive piece of furniture online , but then again this is exactly what i want and for the right price ...
