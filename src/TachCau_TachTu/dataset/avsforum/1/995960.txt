help me pick a 2.0 system to replace my broken klipsch promedia 2.0 s ! .
three years ago , i purchased some klipsch promedia 2.0 speakers after seeking advice from audiophiles like yourselves for the best 2.0 system under $ 150 .
and i loved them .
i mean i really loved them !
unfortunately for my ears and for my budget , i am running into the problem that apparently everyone else but me knew about with these speakers , and the left speaker is now on the fritz .
i am looking to replace them with another 2.0 system .
it 's three years later , but i 'm turning to you , the pros , again : ( nowadays ) what 's the best 2.0 speaker system in the 150 - dollar ballpark ?
