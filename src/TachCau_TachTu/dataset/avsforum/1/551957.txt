post some pictures of your antenna tower / mast if you have them .
all towers are welcome but i 'm a little more interested in the dyi towers , masts , whatever you got going on that gets your antenna off the ground .
not really interested in antennas that are mounted on your roof , chimney , etc. but who am i to discriminate .
the more the merrier .
why do i ask ?
i 'm in a bit of a dilemma with the antenna on our property in a somewhat remote part of michigan .
you can read more about it in this thread .
the short version is ... i think i need to get my antenna , that is about 8 ' agl , to 18 ' , 28 ' or higher .
seeing your towers might help me to come up with a nice sturdy , free standing , mast .
if it does n't at least we 'll all get to see your setups .
very exciting !!!
