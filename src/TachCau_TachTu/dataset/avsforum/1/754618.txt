is now a good time to buy a new plasma ? .
i used to hang out here quite a bit , but it 's been a while !
so .
here 's the deal .
i 've been a happy owner of a panasonic pt - 42pd3 - p 42 " plasma since dec 2002 .
it 's been a great display and i really felt that i 've gotten my moneys worth from it over the past six years .
although it 's only 480p , the picture quality on dvd 's and hdtv has always been great and even today never fails to impress anybody who stops by .
still , i 've been getting the itch to upgrade and compared to 2002 , plasma prices are just ridiculous !
in 2002 , a 50 " plasma was $ 10,000 now you can get a fantastic one for $ 1,500 !
i 'm strongly considering the panasonic th - 50pz800u 50 " and pairing it with the new panny dmp - bd35k bluray player .
i 've found a deal that i can get both delivered for about $ 1900 total .
if i buy it now , i 'll probably have to make it last for at least another 6 - 10 years but i do n't want to be missing out on something 2 - 3 years down the road .
sooo , i guess what i 'm wondering is , are we close to the peak of plasma tech or are there still major innovations in the near future ?
thanks !
