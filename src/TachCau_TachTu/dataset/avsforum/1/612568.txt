insignia ns - pdp32 - 09 32 " plasma at best buy : pretty darn nice lookin !!!! .
just saw this on display at my local best buy , and i got too tell you : i was impressed by the picture and sound !!
i just returned a vizio 37xl lcd a couple of weeks ago because of a bad hd / sd tuner ( sounds popped and skipped on hd / sd channels ) so i am a little gunshy about getting a low name ( not no name ) brand .
but the price was less than the vizio being sold at walmart ( about $ 40 less ) .
it has 3 hdmi inputs ( 1 on the side ) 2 component inputs 1 s - video and 1 composite ( the composite is shared on the side with the 2nd hdmi ) it has the picture changing size option in hd which the vizio appears to lack .
the remote is much more user friendly than the vizio ( direct input buttons / picture size changing button / freeze button / color and sound buttons plus color temp .
button for some plus others ) no ir image reducer / cleanup in menu though ( menu is eerily similiar to the vizio menu 's in their tv 's ) and it " may " only have atsc / ntsc tuners in it .
i am not sure if it has qam or not .
bb says no to qam on website , but the , like other sites , are nortoriously wrong on their info .
the lack of a qam tuner would be a killer for me , but others will feel different .
it had a damn nice picture people !!!!! on both hd and analog .
of course it is because the colors just look alot better , and the blacks are deeper .
i have to admit it was tempting for the bedroom at the price !!
but am still strongly considering the samsung 32a330 , 32a450 , or a 37a330 lcd for the bedroom .
but damn .
go check one out if you can and fiddle with it .
