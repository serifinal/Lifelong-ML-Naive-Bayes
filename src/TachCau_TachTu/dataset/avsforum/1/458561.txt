50 " pioneer kuro pdp - 5010fd or panny th - 50pz850u , best choice ? .
all , assuming both are the same price ... which would you choose ?
does either of the two do better with screen reflection / glare or ir / burn - in .
those are my only two concerns right now .
let me know .
we currently have a panny 42 " 60u in the basement and love it .
looking for a step up in the living room from our 52 " jvc dila .
