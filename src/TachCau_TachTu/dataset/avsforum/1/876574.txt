pioneer elite pro fhd1 vs pro 1150 .
i am looking to purchase my first plasma tv and have narrowed it down to 2 - the pioneer elite pro fhd1 and the pro 1150 .
both are under $ 2500 so price is not a consideration .
i will be placing this unit in a 10 ' x 10 ' room -lrb- fairly dark room -rrb- and will be sitting about 8.5 ' to 9 ' away .
i will be purchasing a blue ray player but most of my viewing will be upconverting my existing standard dvd collection and watching standard and hd cable broadcasts .
i plan on wall mounting this unit and using my hd dvr cable box and an external sound system so the absence of a stand , tuner and speakers are a mute point .
i have looked at both units side by side and so far , am learning torwards the pro fhd1 .
i find the fhd1 to have a sharper image and better color saturation .
obviously having 1080p will not shut me out of the new technology .
i am told the 1150 has better black levels which should give better detail in darker scenes .
i have not seen this yet but will be looking closely for this in my next viewing .
is there anything else i should be considering and looking at ?
i know the 1150 is a newer unit and has the kuro technology but it is only 720p .
i may be kitpicking here but i want to get the best picture quality for the money .
thanks
