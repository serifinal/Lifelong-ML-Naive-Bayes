toshiba vs samsung vs sony , biggest showdown ever ? .
ok , im placing a major order for lcd tvs .
65 of them .
yep , my parents own a motel where we want to upgrade our tvs .
since this is going to be a big buy , i needed some last minute advice .
we are looking at 3 brands ( toshiba , samsung , and sony ) and 3 sizes ( 46 , 40 - 42 , and 37 ) .
here are the tvs based on size : -- 46 inch : toshiba 46rv530u , samsung ln46a550 -- 42 - 40 inch : toshiba 42rv530u , sony kdl40v4150 ( or is it 4100 ) , samsung 40a530 -- 37 inch : toshiba 37av500u , samsung 37a450 so the prices across the sizes are the same , what tvs would you pick from each size ?
( one caveat , if i go toshiba 's i have to get all 3 sizes in the toshiba 's ) any advice ?
