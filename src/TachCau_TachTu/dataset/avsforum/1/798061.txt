need help trying to connect my htpc to a projector . .
i was recently given a sony vpl - vw10ht projector that has 2 component inputs , 1 rca & 1 s - vid .
i 'm trying to integrate it into my media center and i do n't seem to be having much luck .
i thought i could connect it to my htpc via a dvi - i to component cable but i keep coming up with the same error : " frequency is out of range " .
the video card i have on my htpc is an asus eah3450 / di / 256m radeon hd 3450 .
the card can output dvi , hdmi & vga .
before i spend any more money on this i wanted to ask for the support of the forums on the likelihood my next route would work .
i have an onkyo 605 receiver with all my sources going to it ( htpc - hdmi , ps3 - hdmi & wii - component ) and outputing one hdmi cable to my television .
do i need to purchase an hdmi splitter and an hd fury 2 to get my projector to accept this ?
this would be an even more ideal solution since all my sources could connect at once , but i 've already spent $ 60 + on cables and adapters that did n't work .
please help before i waste any more money on this .
i hope all this makes sense .
if you need any more information , let me know .
thanks , john
