yamaha rxv - 1800 or pioneer vsx - 94txh ? .
well , i am looking to get a receiver for the speaker system that i am about to purchase .
i would have had this all squared away last month , but the weather here was a more pressing issue with fay and all .
so , the speaker system that i am looking at is a klipsch 5.1 for now .
the rf - 52 setup with the sub upgraded to the rsw - 10d .
i presently have a need for 3 hdmi inputs and would like to have a 4th available for expansion purposes , hence the reason i am looking at the 94 as opposed to the 92 .
also , as silly as it sounds , i do n't like the plastic removable tab on the front of the 92 ; if you have seen on in person you know what i am talking about .
even though the ps3 is my blu - ray player of choice for now , i would like to be able to decode the latest codecs in case i get a stand alone later .
so , which one would you choose ?
from what i could gather , the 1800 may be better with video scaling and the like , than the 94 .
which one would sound better ?
any input would be appreciated .
