klipsch synergy sub-12 for $ 200 or svs pc12 - nsd for $ 600 .
okay , this decision is absolutely killing me .
i can get a klipsch synergy sub-12 for ~ $ 200 ( u.s. ) http://www.klipsch.com/products/deta...specifications i can get a svs pc12 - nsd for ~ $ 600 ( u.s. ) i would be using the subwoofer in a very small room at below reference level volume for both music and movies .
i know the svs is a way better subwoofer .
but the question is , is the pc12 - nsd $ 400 better ?
probably not .
i kind of had my heart set on the svs .
but $ 200 for a sub-12 seems like an incredibly good offer .
should i hold out for the svs ?
