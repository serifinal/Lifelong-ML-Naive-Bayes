toshiba 46xv545 or samsung ln46a750 or 650 ? .
newbie alert , newbie alert !!!
i am looking into my first home theater upgrade in decades and i am a lost puppy .
i have decided that i will be purchasing a denon avr - 2809 receiver and harmon kardon hkts18 speakers for my sound ( small setup , but i am stuck in an apartment ) .
i have been reading and researching tv 's and the further i get into this the more confused i am .
at the moment i am trying to decide between toshiba regza 46xv545u and samsung ln46a650 or 750 .
i am looking for a simple one or the other answer ( is there such an answer ? )
both have pros and cons , but can anyone help this poor confused old fart out ?
thanks in advance and happy new year !!
