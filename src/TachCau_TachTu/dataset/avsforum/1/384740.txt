panasonic th-42px80u or samsung pn42a400 -lrb- same price -rrb- .
i ca n't sleep over this decision .
both have the same price tag and similar features ... i would love to hear from owners of either one and if anyone could help me make this decision i would greatly appreciate it .
btw , sound quality is not a factor in making my decision , and both have plenty of connections .
thanks .
