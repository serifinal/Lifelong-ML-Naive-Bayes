parasound 2250 or sunfire cinema grand .
i 've never had a separate power amp before ( using a denon 3803 ) but am shopping for a new pair of floorstander speakers and feel like i might want a little more power .
i know a guy selling a used parasound 2250 250 - watt 2ch ( $ 600 used ) and a sunfire cinema grand 200 - watt 5ch ( $ 700 used ) .
i have a 5.1 system but mostly interested in improving my 2 channel sound and could continue to use my receiver for the center channel and surrounds .
i also was wondering about the outlaw audio 200 - watt monoblocks ( $ 350 apiece ) .
i 'm trying to stay under $ 800 , but obviously i do n't want to get something that does n't offer substantial improvement over my denon in terms of quality .
any opinions on these amps are appreciated .
