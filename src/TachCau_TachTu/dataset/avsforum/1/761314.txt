sofa directly in the path of a sub - is this a problem ? .
i 'm thinking of getting a bic h - 100 sub .
where i need to put it in the room it would be sitting to the side of the tv and left front tower speaker , with the sub 's back about 6 inches from the front wall .
its front - mounted speaker would be pointing directly into an upolstered sofa that would be about 6 - 8 inches away .
will a sofa or similar furniture absorb much of a sub 's sound ?
