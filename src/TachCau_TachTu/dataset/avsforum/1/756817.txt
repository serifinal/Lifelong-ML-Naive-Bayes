hey eveyone , i am looking to upgrade from my toshiba 50 inch rear projection tv to add hd and clear some space in my living room .
i started with the cnet reviews and then did some cost comparison .
long story short the cc website has all three models within $ 20 bucks .
i wanted to look at them in person and went in thinking bigger is better with the lcd but when i saw them in person and spoke to the salesperson my alliance changed .
things to consider .
there is light coming into the room from late day sun so glare might be an issue .
i have 4 month old twin boys so duribility is a concern even though we will try to keep the toys and playing to the basement .
our main viewing will be dvd 's and regular cable tv with hd programming .
no gaming .
i have a tendency to over analyze things and especially with bigger purchase .
what i am looking for are some simple reasons why one set will be better than the other two .
i appreciate the help in advance .... ~ ryan
