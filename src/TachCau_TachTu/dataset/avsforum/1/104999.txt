samsung ln40a650 40 - inch 1080p 120hz lcd hdtv with red touch of color .
hey guys i was just looking at this tv on amazon and i am just wondering if this would be a good set for gaming ?
the 40 " model i believe is $ 1500 on amazon and the specs are 1080p , 120hz , 4ms response , 50,000:1 contrast .
if anyone who owns this or knows anything about it please let me know , and my main purpose will be for gaming , thanks .
