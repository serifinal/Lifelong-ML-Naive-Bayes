samsung pn50a550 or samsung ln40a650 , i need help ! .
i am new to avs but i think this is the coolest forum i have found on the net .
anyway , to the reason why i am here .
i am going to buy my first hdtv on monday 3/5/08 .
i am torn up because i really like the samsung 40a650 lcd and the samsung 50a550 plasma .
that is a big jump in size but the prices are right at the top of my budget and i think these are awesome sets .
some pros / cons about each are below .
keep in mind that i was comparing these sets at bb , both hooked up with coax and a remote to flip channels and tweak settings between hd , sd , and analog .
samsung 50a550 plasma : i like the overall picture quality of the plasma , i think the motion is much smoother and it is easier on the eyes .
i don?t like the fact that the lcd is much brighter looking and the colors pop out at you .
the lcd is sharp and looks crisp and has cleaner looking images .
samsung 40a650 lcd : again , i like the fact that the lcd is much brighter , cleaner , and sharper looking while watching hd signals .
however , when i put both tv?s on sd / analog channels the samsung 50a550 smoked the lcd?s in the store .
while watching standard tv there is a lot of fuzz or pixilation i guess , ( it looks very grainy and kind of pitiful ) on the lcd but the plasma looked awesome with any signal coming to it .
my logic says that having better cables and a stronger signal , the plasma would still look better than the lcd .
does this sound crazy ?
i need help from the people who own either one of these sets .
after tonight though , i am leaning towards the plasma ( i get a bigger set in the same price range also ) .
