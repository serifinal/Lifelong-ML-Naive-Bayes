.
i am looking to buy a 42 ' plasma and i have narrowed it down to the samsung pn42a450 and the lg 42pg20 .
i plan on watching sd and hd content on the tv through satellite or over my wired network on the xbox 360 .
i also plan on using the tv for gaming .
so i am curious which tv should i get , samsung pn42a450 or lg 42pg20 ?
thanks for your help .
