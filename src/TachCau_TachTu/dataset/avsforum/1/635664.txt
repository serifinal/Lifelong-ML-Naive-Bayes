thinking about buying the onkyo tx - sr876 ( looking for other suggestions ) .
i 'm seriously considering buying the onkyo tx - sr876 for the following reasons : 1 .
2 hdmi out .
( i need to be able to feed 2 tvs ) 2 .
4 hdmi in .
3 .
hqv reon - vx 4 .
hd radio are there any other receivers i should consider at that price range or less ?
main devices connected to this tv will be ps3 , directv hr20 , htpc w / xbmc , and a few older console systems ( gamecube , xbox ) .
i like the new ui sony is using , but i 've heard compatibility issues with directv hr20 via hdmi and other hdmi incompatibilities .
