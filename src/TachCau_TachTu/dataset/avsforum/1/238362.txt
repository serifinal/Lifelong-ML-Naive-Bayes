.
our 10 year old 29 " magnavox is about to die ( it 's entered the whacking stage ) , so we 're finally going hd this year .
our plan is a 40 + " tv for under $ 800 , bought from a physical local store ( really do n't want to risk the hassle of shipping back a defective unit ) .
so far we 've found a couple candidates , 1080p with hdmi & vga for $ 700 .
we 're not really in a hurry , since we 're not big tv users ( less than basic cable , a couple hours of dvd & wii per week ) .
so we 're wondering if better deals are likely as xmas approaches .
advice , reviews , other bargains , etc would be appreciated .
