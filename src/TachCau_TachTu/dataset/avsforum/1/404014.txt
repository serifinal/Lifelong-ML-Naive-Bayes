need help with a setup for mutiple regions .
in a few months i plan on buying my first hdtv and i 'm obviously going to get a blu-ray player to go along with it .
my problem is that i buy foreign language films from europe as well , and unfortunately blu-ray still supports region encoding .
i am looking to keep this setup 100 % legal , so i 'd much prefer to not have to resort to downloading torrents and streaming them from a ps3 .
other than simply buying two players , one for each region , what other options are there ?
