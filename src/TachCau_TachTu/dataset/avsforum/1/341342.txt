hey , 8ironbob .
i posted this on another thread as well , but need responses soon ... quick question for you guys .
i currently own a 46v4100 which is going back to the store soon .
it has a bad case of sparkles .
i went to a few stores after work last night and my set is much worse than the sony display units i saw ( w , v and z models ) which is good news .
i plan on exchanging my set for another v4100 or i might consider upgrading to the w4100 or even the z4100 ( i 've totally blown my budget !!! ) .
what is the best value pick here ?
i will likely buy local which will means i 'm paying about $ 75 ( with coupon ) under msrp after tax for the z4100 or about $ 250 under msrp for the w410 ( unless i can find a better price online from a store that pays shipping on returns if there is a problem ) .
should i step up to the z ?
how does the z 's sound compare to the w and v ?
sound is very important to me .
the v 's sound is great imo .
is there enough differences and advantages in the z to justify paying an additional $ 470 ( which is the price difference as the w is slightly discounted ) ?
i do n't want to play the return game over and over so unless the next unit has a major flaw , i 'll be keeping it .
