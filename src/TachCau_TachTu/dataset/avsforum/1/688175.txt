samsung 650 and 750 series , sony xbr5 , panny th - 50pz800u or new pioneer kuro 9g 5020 .
ok if you had to choose between samsung 650 and 750 series , sony xbr5 , panny th - 50pz800u or new pioneer kuro 9g 5020 ... i will be buying my set no later than august ... i have roughly about 3600 bucks to spend ... .
now most of my tv watching is composed of hd shows and blue ray movies . .
as for gaming i will probably be doing that in about a year or so ... i would not game for more than 2 hours a day or every other day ... .
i watch alot of tv with some of the lights on . .
i do prefer lights off though ... i watch tv when im eating and that is usually at about a 45 - 60 degree angle .... .
most of my tv watching is done at dead center though ... .
my personal preference : i hate motion artifacts i cant stand them . .
i love razor sharp pictures and warm colors ... i love good black levels ... which of these sets do you think will provide the best pq and why ... which would you buy ??? i love the pop and sharpness of the sony xbr4 but love the blacks and smoothness and flawless playback of the pioneers ... the more i review on avs the more im confused lol ...
