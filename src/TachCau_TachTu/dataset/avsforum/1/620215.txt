help to buy new intel cpu ? .
i 'm about to buy a new cpu instead of my e6600 , because i want more cpu power , so i do n't have to upgrade the next couple of months and i would like it to be a powersaving one too .
which cpu is recommendable of the new wolfdales ?
have been looking at e7200 , e7300 or e8400 , but do n't know how big the difference are between the performance and power use ?
right now i 'm using approx 75 - 80 w ( dg45id , floppydtv , 1 tb hdd , bdc - 202 ) and would like to keep it at that area + - a few w. i know you can use the dg45id and an old cpu and still pull off blu - ray , but would also like to use it with ffdshow and seesaw , and perhaps even seesaw 2 , if it does n't require quad core to run smooth .
what should i choose ?
