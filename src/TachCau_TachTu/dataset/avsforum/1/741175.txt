denon avr - 4308ci , onkyo tx - nr905 or pioneer vsx - 94txh - please help me decide .
hi guys .
i have an onkyo tx - sr600 receiver paired with a pro-150fd pdp display .
i am in the market for a new , sub - $ 2000 , receiver and so far these three units the : denon avr - 4308ci , onkyo tx - nr905 and pioneer vsx - 94txh seem to be likely candidates .
please weigh in regarding your opinion of these avrs and recommendations regarding which model you would choose .
if there are additional avrs equivalent to the receivers i have listed that should be considered , i would appreciate those recommendations too .
