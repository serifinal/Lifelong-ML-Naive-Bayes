when is the best time to buy .
i am seriously considering jumping on board and joining the ranks of projector owner , but want to do it wisely .
my question is when can i expect to find the best deals ?
i am willing to wait a number of months to find bargains .
- is black friday the best ?
- later on in the christmas season / year end ?
- super bowl time ?
- new model releases ?
- other ?
- will the economic troubles cause there to be some extra special deals do you think ?
of course i realize at some point you just have to go for it because otherwise you will be waiting for ever , but still i would appreciate thoughts and advice on when would be the best time to part with my hard earned money .
thanks .
