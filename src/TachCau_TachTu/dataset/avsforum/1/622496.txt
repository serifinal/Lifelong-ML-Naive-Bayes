powerdvd 8 or arcsoft totalmedia theatre ? .
i need to buy blu ray playback software .
i do n't want any solutions that i need to hack to work .
so i 've narrowed it down to either powerdvd 8 or arcsoft 's totalmedia theatre .
i plan to stream blu ray iso 's from my media server to my htpc , so iso playback is a must .
which one would you guys choose and why ?
thanks in advance .
