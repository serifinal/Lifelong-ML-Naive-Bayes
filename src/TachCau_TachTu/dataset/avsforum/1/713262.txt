arcsoft totalmedia theatre - mce decoder problem .
hi , i 've just rebuilt my htpc from scratch , and as i 'm looking at a blu - ray upgrade in the near future , i 'd thought i 'd give totalmedia theatre a try instead of powerdvd , as it has an mce plug - in for blu - ray .
it 's an old box , with a p4 , not enough memory etc , but it 's been working fine .
i had some sort of corruption , so i thought i 'd do a complete windows mce re-install .
everything went ok ( apart from the fact that you ca n't install wmp11 after you 've installed sp3 .
backing sp3 out seemed to be causing more problems , so i started again and installed wmp11 before sp3 ... ) .
so i installed totalmedia , including a sizeable update , and then fired up mce expecting it to use the totalmedia codec .
but nothing , even the speaker set up failed , due to there being no decoder .
same problem in wmp11 ( although it said that there may be a problem with display colour / resolution ! ) .
tried tmt in standalone mode , and no problem , played fine .
i thought it might be a sequence problem so i uninstalled , re-installed , rebooted etc etc. but still no joy .
finally i installed powerdvd6. , and it all worked fine .
anybody had any similar experiences with tmt ?
