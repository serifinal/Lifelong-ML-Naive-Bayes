sony kdl-42v4100 or samsung ln40a530 .
hello , i 'm having trouble deciding on a tv to get .
it 's my first time purchasing an hdtv , and i 'm a little lost as to what is best .
i want something 40 inches or more , but i ca n't really break 1k $ .
i am able to get both of these tvs for about the same price , which would be the better buy ?
people tell me sony 's are the best , but when i read around online i see that samsung is a good brand as well .
since it 's my first time i do n't want to make a mistake , especially with so much money . .
