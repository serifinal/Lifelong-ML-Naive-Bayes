toshiba 52hm84 - do i need to replace the lamp ballast ? .
i 've been looking around and posting in a few older threads but i have been unable to get a clear answer .
i think i need to replace the lamp ballast in my toshiba 52hm84 dlp television .
sometimes when i go to turn on the tv i will hear the audio come on but the video will not come up .
then the green light will blink 9 times and the tv will try to restart itself .
usually after a few tries it will come on and work as it should .
sometimes if it seems like is n't going to come on , i give it a 5 - 10 minute rest and then it comes on fine .
other times -lrb- like last night when i got home from work and this morning before leaving the house -rrb- i turned it on and it came on on the first try .
can anyone tell me if this is a ballast issue ?
and if it is , does anyone know the difference between part # 's 23122468 and 23122468p ?
the only thing i can find is the one with the p on the end is cheaper .
