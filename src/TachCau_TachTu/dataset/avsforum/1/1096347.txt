what motherboard to get for intel cpu and 8800gt to get lcpm audio to my avr ? .
hey guys , i am looking for a budget ( < $ 100 ) miroatx motherboard for my htpc so that i can use my current 8800gs video card and core duo e2200 cpu for hd playback with lcpm audio .
i done a bit of search on the forum , but did not find any motherboard that fits my needs .
my goal is to spend as little as possible to get lpcm audio ( hdmi audio ) for hd movies .
my current setup listed below allows me to watch hd movies smoothly ( hd dvd and blueray ) , i am passing audio from my htpc to my avr using s / pdif .
my current setup : cpu : core duo e2200 motherboard : ecs 945gct - m soundcard : soundblaster x-fi extrememusic videocard : gigabyte 8800gs hd drive : lg hd - dvd / blueray combo drive avr : denon avr - 889 remotes : harmony h659 , gyration mce control with air mouse .
connections : 8800gs to lcd tv using dvi - > hdmi cable .
