noob needs some help - sub building .
i 'm very sad that my pb12 died ... instead of buying another sub , i was told i should consider building my own . .
can someone link me to a faq or something along those lines ?
i 'm hoping to learn the basics so i can decide if i want to build one myself .
also , if you can link to some vendors for amps / subs or recommend some brands i should be considering .
thanks !
