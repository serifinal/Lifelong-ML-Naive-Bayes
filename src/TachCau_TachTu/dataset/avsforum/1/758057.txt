exchange 40 " 1080p lcd for 42 " 720p plasma ? .
i recently purchased the samsung ln40a550 , but after seeing a friend 's panasonic plasma , i 'm wondering if i should return the lcd and save a few bucks by going with the slightly larger ( 2 " ) panasonic th - 42px80u .
i sit about 9 - 10 ' away from the tv , so the difference between 720p and 1080p is n't a big deal .
the room has little to no direct sunlight and low ambient light , so glare is n't a big issue .
my only concern is the potential for burn in because i do some gaming , although not a lot .
so , should i return the lcd and go with the plasma ?
