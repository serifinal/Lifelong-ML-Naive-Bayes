online retailer ? .
as i sit here looking for a good price on an 42 " panny plasma , i was wondering if anyone has purchased their hdtv 's from any of the online retailers ?
i see that 6th ave has a really good price on the set that i want , but i 'm just wondering about buying online ?
personally , i have never had a bad experience buying online , but i would like to hear your opinions ; in particular , buying plasma or lcd tv 's online ... thanks !!!
