needs advice between 720p and 1080p on a 32 '' - is there a significant difference ? .
i 'm a layman who needs advice on the actual difference between 720p and 1080p .
i am planning to buy a 32 '' lcd hdtv .
now i have two models finally in my mind 1 .
vizio vo32lf which is 1080p capable 2 .
sony kdl-32l4000 which is 720p while my mind leans towards sony considering their brand image , i am seriuosly concerned about its limited 720p .
is it actually a limitation on a 32 '' ?
will vizio outperform sony -lrb- between 2 given models -rrb- ?
is vizio yet a reliable brand in terms of durability ?
is there a significant difference in terms of common tv usage between 720p and 1080p ?
