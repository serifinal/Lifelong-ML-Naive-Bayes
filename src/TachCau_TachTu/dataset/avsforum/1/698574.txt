w4100 for $ 2250 or xbr6 for $ 2600 ? .
we are looking for an upper-level 52 '' lcd , and we 've settled on 2 tvs : 1 -rrb- the wl140 -lrb- basically the w4100 + the internet video link -rrb- and 2 -rrb- the xbr6 for i know the general difference in specs between the xbr6 and the w-series , but i honestly do n't know how much of a difference 10-bit , deep color , etc makes .
what am i really gaining over the w if i go for the xbr6 ?
is the quality difference really worth the price ?
