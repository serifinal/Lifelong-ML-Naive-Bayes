w4100 for $ 2250 or xbr6 for $ 2600 ? .
we are looking for an upper - level 52 " lcd , and we 've settled on 2 tvs : 1 ) the wl140 ( basically the w4100 + the internet video link ) and 2 ) the xbr6 for i know the general difference in specs between the xbr6 and the w - series , but i honestly do n't know how much of a difference 10 - bit , deep color , etc makes .
what am i really gaining over the w if i go for the xbr6 ?
is the quality difference really worth the price ?
