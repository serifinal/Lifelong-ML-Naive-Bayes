audyssey multi eq + dynamic eq vs. multi eq xt .
i 'm looking at 2 receivers with different audyssey features .
1 -rrb- multi eq + dynamic eq 2 -rrb- multi eq xt would you sacrifice the higher resolution equalization filters and 2 extra room position measurements in the xt version to get dynamic eq ?
looking forward to hearing your opinions !
