.
i 'm considering purchasing the klipsch wf - 35 set and the pioneer vsx - 94txh .
http://www.klipsch.com/products/deta...e-theater.aspx http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/pu...vers/vsx-94txh the vsx - 94txh is boasting 140w x 7 @ 8ohms .
my issue is with the wf - 35 's center ( wf - 24 ) and surround speakers ( ws - 24 ) .
recommended power handling is 90w and 75w respectively ( @ 8 ohms ) .
is there a way of limited power to these speakers which i 'm unaware of ?
or should i not worry about it ?
thanks for your help
