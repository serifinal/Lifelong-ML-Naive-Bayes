samsung lcd vs. panasonic plasma .
hey everyone i 'd appreciate it if you could help avoid a midlife crisis here .
i 'm looking to get a big - screen flat panel for the main living room , and have done extensive research on cnet and am now coming here .
basically i want the next best thing after pioneer i will be sitting around 15 ft away for the tv , so the screen size will be between 50 " - 60 " 1 .
if i were to get a 50 " plasma , it 'd have to be the panasonic 50 - pz800u i understand that this is the best 50 " non-pioneer plasma 2 .
if i were to get a 52 " lcd , it 'd have to be the samsung ln52a650 i would rather have this than the ln52a750 or 850 , because honestly , there really is n't any difference in the newer series but the price difference .
3 .
if i were to get anything bigger , it 'd have to be the panasonic 58 - pz800u hopefully i can just settle for a 50 - 52 " please help me decide between the panny 50 - pz800u plasma or the sammy ln52a650 lcd .
they are about the same price , $ 2000 .
i wo n't be watching too many dvds on them , as i have a separate home theater for that .
this tv will be mostly for cable television and some gaming .
recommendations ?
