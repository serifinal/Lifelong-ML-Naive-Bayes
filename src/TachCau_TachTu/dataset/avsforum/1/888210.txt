sony w3000 vs. samsung ln - t71f , someone please break the tie ! .
i 'm trying to decide between two rather equal models between the two best lcd brands , since i hardly find any difference in quality .
what are the pros and cons between both the sammy ln - t4671f or sony 46w3000 ?
those are both equally spec 'd and priced by every sense of the word , and i do n't know which direction would be better .
