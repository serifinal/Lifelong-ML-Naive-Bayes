help please decide samsung 52 " a650 or sony 46 " xbr4 .
thank you very much in advance .
any help on this is greatly appreciated .
i am in process of purchasing lcd tv .
undecided either ln52a650 samsung ( 2499 cad at best buy ) and sony 46 " xbr4 ( 3099 cad ) .
here are plus and minuses as follow : 1 / dynamic of a650 is more contrast than xbr4 but details in shadow are not as clear as sony .
imho 2 / 600 clams a650 less than xbr4 .
plus imo ( although i 'm willing to spend a little bit more and be happy with the purchase , than safe a little and kick my self in the " you know what " after ) .
3 / piano black on a650 is shiny and glares .
minus imho so , if any hd guru or owners of both tv out there can shed a light and help me out deciding between the 2 models is greatly appreciated .
thanks again .
