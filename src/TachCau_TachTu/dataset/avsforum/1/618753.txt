panasonic 42 " 720p plasma or samsung 40 " 1080p lcd ? .
i can get the 42 " 720p panasonic th - c42hd18 plasma ( costco 's version of the 42px80u ) for $ 640 out - the - door , or the 40 " 1080p samsung lcd ( sears specific model ln40a500 which is similar to the a530 ) for $ 860 out - the - door .
which one will perform better for my situation ?
my viewing distance is about 8 feet , and i will watch blu - ray with a ps3 , a little bit of ps3 gaming , and some channels i frequently watch are still sd only .
i tend to think the panasonic fits my needs better because of price and my viewing distance , am i right ?
i am willing to pay the extra $ 220 if a samsung 1080p will make a huge difference over the pansonic in performance though ... thanks !
