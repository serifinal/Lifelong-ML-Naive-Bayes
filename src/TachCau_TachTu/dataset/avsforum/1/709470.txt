hf100 vs. hg20 decision killing me .
hello everybody , i 'm sure this has been asked in one way or another already buuuut , i 'm planning to purchase one of these two units in the coming days .
i just ca n't seem to pull the trigger .
the pricing is way screwy .
now it seems i can get the hg20 or the hf100 from amazon with black friday pricing for around $ 550 .
-lrb- the hg20 even includes a free $ 140 bp-827 battery -rrb- i realize the requisite sdhc cost for the hf100 is n't being factored in .
i would really appreciate the real world experiences any of you could share that speak for or against both of these , particularly with respect to the preference for hdd vs. flash and ergonomics -lrb- control placement -rrb- .
i 'll admit , the allure of 60gb at hand means potentially never needing to worry if the clip is worth taking .
that concept plays right into the appeal of digital still photography where remaining `` film '' is n't a concern any longer .
on the other hand , flash is quite a bit more durable , only getting cheaper and a 16gb sdhc would probably afford me plenty of time .
my primary viewing will be on a 46 '' samsung via hdmi and also i 'll also be archiving videos , primarily of my daughter , as she grows up .
thoughts ?
thanks in advance .
