rs20 buyers - what screen are you planning to use with it ? .
i am in the first group of the rs20 pre order and i just wanted to get some idea on what screen other rs20 owners are planning to using with this projector .
i would like to know the size , gain , aspect ratio and brand / model .
as for me , i am leaning towards a motorized stewart st130 100 to 110 " , gain 1.3 , 16:9 .
thanks , rich
