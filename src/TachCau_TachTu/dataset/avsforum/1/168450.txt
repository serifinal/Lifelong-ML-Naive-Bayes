should i buy the extended warranty ? .
i 'm about to order ( tomorrow , most likely ) a sammy ln52a750 from buydig and the extra warranty is $ 159 .
is it worth it ?
i 've never bought an extended warranty on anything other than a car ( $ 400 extra on the price of a charger is n't much to ask ) .
i 'm not seeing any posts about problems with his monitor .
