screen wall color .
i 'm getting ready to buy my projector ( glad i waited , the new sony vpl - hw10 sounds awesome ) , and purchase by foxed 102 " screen .
question is , should i paint the screen wall matte black before i hang the screen ?
right now the wall is painted the same color as all of other walls in the room ... any advice ?
i need to get to a decision soon ( and also have to be able to convince my wife that it will look good ... any thoughts ?
