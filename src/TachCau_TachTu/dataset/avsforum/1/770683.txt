samsung a650 vs. toshiba 530u vs. panasonic lz800 .
i 'd like to start off by saying i 've been following a few threads on here for awhile and been doing some research and narrowed my choices down to these three screens .
i 'm looking to buy a new lcd tv for when i move into my new house in the next month or so .
i want to buy a 32 " or 37 " set and it will mostly be used for watching hd - dvd movies , xbox 360 and pc input through hdmi .
my laptop has an hdmi output so that 's how i will be hooking it up .
i 'm looking for the tv with lowest input lag as that is a big factor to me for gaming , as well as using the screen as a monitor for my laptop .
what set do you think has the best overall color reproduction , as well as black levels , etc and so on .
any input would be appreciated .
i 'm in no hurry to buy one at the moment , so i 'm just trying to do all my research before i pull the trigger on one of these lcd 's thanks
