60/61 inch mits 60735 vs. sam 61a650 vs. sam 61a750 .
i have settled on a 60/61 inch dlp to replace my 8 year old mits 55 inch rptv .
i would appreciate any comments / recommedations / concerns about the above 3 sets .
here is what i have found out so far : 1 .
the prices from a local retailer are $ 1300 , $ 1400 , $ 1800 respectively .
2 .
the mits has easily accessable front inputs including usb .
sam on the back .
3 .
the samsungs have a vga input .
no for mits 4 .
the mits replacement bulb is only $ 99 from mits .
is the samsung bulb much more ?
5 .
the 2 samsungs seem identical except for the led ( i.e. no bulb / color wheel to replace ) 6 .
i have a 3 year old samsung 46 " 720p dlp that i am happy with .
7 .
i was happy my old mits .
unitil it bit the dust after almost 8 years .
i am leaning towards the mits .
are there any other significant differences that would justify the extra $ 100 for the sam a650 or the extra $ 400 - $ 500 for the sam a750 .
thanks .
jay
