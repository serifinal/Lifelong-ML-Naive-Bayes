discrete input hex codes for insignia ns - 42pdp .
hi everyone , i 'm looking for the discrete input hex codes for my insignia 42 " plasma tv .
i am using a harmony 880 remote and logitech informed me that if i can get the hex codes they will update their database .
if anyone one has them or knows where they can be found it would be appreciated .
thanks craig
