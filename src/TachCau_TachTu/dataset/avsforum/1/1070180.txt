looking for some advice / help on a new projector .
hi all , i 'm looking for some help in choosing an upgrade to my ol' z2 .
i have over 3300 hours on the first lamp , and it 's still going strong , but i just have a craving for a better ( and brighter ) picture .
i 'm going to be acquiring a blu - ray source for xmas , so i thought it would be a good time to upgrade to a 1080p projector .
i 've done some moderate research on projectorreviews.com , and i 'm leaning toward a panny ae3000 or the epson powerlite home cinema 1080 .
i know either one will be a major upgrade from my z2 .
i 'd really like some opinions on these two units .... or if anyone else has any other suggestions ... i 'm all ears ( i prefer 3lcd models since the lcos are kinda pricey right now ) .
i 'm looking to spend a maximum of around $ 2500 .
i have a da - lite da snap 120 " fixed screen ( i believe it 's the damat material ) , and my proj .
mount is approximately 13 ' from the screen .
thanks in advance !
