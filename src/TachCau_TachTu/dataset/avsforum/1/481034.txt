mits 60735 vs sam 61a750 .
looking for opinions on these two sets .
i have been very focused on the samsung 61a750 for about a month now , waiting for a decent price point .
i have seen the mits advertised for about $ 500 less than the samsung and i am starting to wonder if there is $ 500 difference in quality .
i know the samsung led does not need bulbs , but at $ 99 each it will take at least 10 years to recover the price difference .
i do n't care at all about power consumption or " greenness " , i only care about pq and reliability .
bottom line , is the samsung worth the extra $ 500 ?
