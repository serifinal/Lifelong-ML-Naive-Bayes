i will give some more details : i have a klipsch synergy 5.1 setup .
looking to go 7.1 with hdmi and networking .
always have liked my old yamaha rxv - 595 , although i agree with some in this forum tha the yamaha klipsch combo can be a little too bright .
would i be better off with pioneer or denon ?
