sharp aquos or samsung .
i purchased a vizio xzt lcd to and am not happy with the jerky motion i get in movies and some tv shows .
i use cable not will not go to hd .
i have tried all settings and called tech support to no avail .
i am considering sharp aquos lc5264u or samsung 52 in ( unsure model ) .
does any one have a idea which would produce a smother image ?
i understand these are larger sets and may introduce more problems .
any input greatly appreciated .
