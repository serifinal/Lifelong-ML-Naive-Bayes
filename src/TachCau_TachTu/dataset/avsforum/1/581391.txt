sony w4100 vs samsung 650 .
i do n't know what to get what tv should i get ??????? i know that sony w4100 are not out yet but in the best buy where i work we have 2 40 '' in stock so that makes me feel confused i wish we can display that tv to see how looks but we ca n't into next month any way if i wan na buy it i can buy it but i do n't wan na buy something that i do n't know how looks any way i do n't think that sony will be so bad but im afraid to the motion flow 120hz does not look cool as the samsung 650 series .
so give me your opinions please i need to get my new lcd sony with w4100 series or samsung 650 series ????? i want it more for blu ray movies -lrb- ps3 -rrb-
