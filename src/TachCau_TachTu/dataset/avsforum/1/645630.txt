hi all !
recently my ~ 5yo samsung hlm507wx dlp decided it was time to give - up on the world and venture to the great beyond .
i 've been debating what to replace it with , realized i did n't really need 50 ' or want to spend the money for another samsung dlp and so have come down to these two choices : 1 .
panasonic th - 42pz800u 2 .
samsung ln - t4081f the panasonic has received some great reviews , has thx certs and 480hz sub-field drive ( which i presume is their marketing speak for 120hz ? )
whereas the samsung has excellent black levels and led backlighting ( does it do 120hz ? ) .
so i 'm torn .
i 've read over the owners threads here on avs mostly but they 're hundreds and hundreds of pages long so i 'm sure i missed some crucial details .
i have to say last night i went to bed convinced that i should save some money and go with a vizio sv420xvt but given the price range of the above panasonic & samsung , it seemed silly to make such an investment somewhere that had mixed opinions .
any input or clarifications on the various features would be really , really helpful !
also i 'm not in a must - buy - this - weekend hurry so if there 's a new set that is n't out yet but at the same price point ( ~ $ 1,400 ) i 'd be more than happy to wait .
thank you !
