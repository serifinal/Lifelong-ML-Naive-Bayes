samsung 650 or 750 ... and ca n't find a stand ? .
hi , just a couple of quick ones .
i 've decided on either the samsung 650 or 750 lcd 52 '' tv .
it does n't really matter which one .
i found a couple places to order : http://www.paylessplasma.com/product...?productid=339 and http://www.drplasma.com/productdetai...productid=3309 anybody order from either of these places before ?
or is there another online standby i should order from ?
second thing ... i know there is a stand for the 52 '' 650 and a different one for the 52 '' 750 .
for the life of me , i ca n't figure out what stand i need , and where i can order it ?
any help is greatly appreciated ... thanks !
dan
