buying a jvc dla - rs1x -- what kind of screen ? .
we previously had da - lite with our fujitsu projector , however this time around we have been given the option between stewart and draper .
the home theater installer we are working with recommends draper in the 16:9 hdtv ratio -- 106 inches diagonally , fixed screen .
he mentioned the onyx , but i 'm not sure we like the 4 inch band around the screen .
regardless , they seem to have several different models as far as color , gray , white , etc. .
not sure which one to go with .
any ideas ?
what is cinemascope ratio ?
