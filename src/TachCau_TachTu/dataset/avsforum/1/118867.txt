looking for a great tv for gaming .
-lrb- 46-50 inch or larger -rrb- .
we are going to make a gaming room so does anyone have any good recommendations ?
i would prefer to choose from tvs from bestbuy because they have alot of coupons usually ... but if i can find a better deal somewhere else please let me know !
i was looking at the pioneer plasmas ... expensive but are there any good deals on them ?
we would n't want to spend over 2k i do n't think .
so any recommendations please keep them coming !
thanks !
