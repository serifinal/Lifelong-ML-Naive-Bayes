confused between samsung 81 series and samsung a750 ! .
hi all , i am a new member to the forum and have been really impressed with all the posts .
it has all been very helpful .
i am on the market for a 40 '' lcd tv and have narrowed it down between the samsung 81 series with the led backlight and the new samsung a750 .
i am terribly confused between the two .
the picture looks equally stunning in both , although the 81 seems to have better contrast ratio and black levels .
my only problem with the 81 though is samsung is phasing it out , so not sure if i should buy a tv that 's not going to be available soon .
also , the 750 has some pretty neat features like being able to get connected to the internet and the dlna streaming capability .
price is the same for both sets . .
any thoughts / suggestions ?
thanks !
