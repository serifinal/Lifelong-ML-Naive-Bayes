terminator 2 : judgement day . "
terminator 2 : judgement day " is being sold cheap everywhere i see it .
i 'm very tempted to buy it , but i hesitate because i 've heard that the pq is not very good with the current release .
seeing how prices are so cheap with this title , is it possible lionsgate is planning a new and improved release ?
has anyone heard about an upcoming re-release ?
