samsung 550 vs. panny 800u ?
help deciding .
i 'm looking to get my first plasma , have been researching reviews and forums online for most of the day today and i think it 's come down to either the samsung pna550 for $ 1472 and the panasonic 50pz800u for $ 2114 .
that 's a big difference in price and have read all over the net that the 800u is arguably the best on the market right now at least around that price point .
but , have read high praise for the 550 as well .
so , i 'm trying to decide if i want to spend the extra $ 650 on the panny .
it is going to be mounted in a small - medium sized room and used mostly for hdtv , sports specifically .
any feedback would be much appreciated .
thanks guys .
