i need help deciding between these 2 panasonics ! .
hello , i 've been looking for a tv for nearly 2 months now and i 'm pretty sure i do want a plasma and i was interested in the panasonic th42pz80u or the th42pz85u .
i would like to know the differences between the two and which would be a better purchase for the money .
i know plasma 's do use more power than lcd 's and i heard the 80u was more energy efficient , would this make a really big difference ??
