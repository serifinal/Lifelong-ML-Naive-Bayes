sony xbr 6 vs samsung a550/a650 .
very interested in these 2/3 tvs but i 'm having trouble choosing .
i 've read a couple of posts on this forum saying that samsung has sony beat this year and the picture on the samsung is better with a better contrast ratio and such .
i 've also heard the positive side of sony regarding their built in speakers , which is supposed to be better than sammys .
my main concern though is input lag as i do play alot of competitive games -lrb- well mainly smash bros lol -rrb- but i also would like to have the better looking tv .
can you guys offer some insight or care to explain which one is the better tv ?
im not worried about the money issue but just want to know which of the tvs are better .
