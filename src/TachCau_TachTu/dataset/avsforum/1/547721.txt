sharp 46 ?
lc - 46sb54u lcd hdtv .
so , i decided to purchase the sharp 46 ?
lc - 46sb54u lcd hdtv from dell during the after thanksgiving sale .
they had it listed for $ 899.00 and i had a $ 100.00 dell credit so i go this thing for $ 799.00 .
however ... the problem i am having with the tv is the detection of the resolution each channel is bring broadcasted in .
let me try to explain it !
it down converts just fine .
i.e. .
when i am watching a channel that is 1080i and switch to a challen being broadcasted in 720p the conversion goes just fine but when i switch back to the 1080i channel it does not upconvert back to 1080i and remains in 720p .
frustrating !!!!!!! does anyone have a similar experience or know of something i may be doing wrong ?
any thoughts would be much appreciated .
