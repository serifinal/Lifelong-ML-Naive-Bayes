buy wii now or wait for the holiday season ? .
hi , i want to give a wii console to the kids for christmas .
with all the product shortages , should i buy it now ?
... ... or are there good reasons to wait until the holiday season ?
are there any technology upgrades or price reductions expected ?
thank you very much for your comments
