buy the panasonic pz85 or wait for the pz800 .
i posted this in the lineup thread but i thought it might be more useful as a new thread .
there does seem to be a lot of interest in this subject .
does anyone know how this year 's pz85 series speakers compare to last year 's pz700 series ?
the 800 series has the upgraded shades of gradation .
how big of a deal is this ?
is there really a strong reason to believe that false contouring with the upgraded contrast ratio will be an issue ?
last question , or at least a solicitation for advice .
i currently have a crt and an old pioneer 5.1 system .
i am weighing the options : i can get a pz85 + onkyo 605 + and set of speakers ( probably onkyo ht420 's ) or a pz800 within my budget , what would you do ?
