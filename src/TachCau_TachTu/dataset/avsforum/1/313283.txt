looking for hdtv mount that can rotate 180 degrees and move in and out ... .
okay , so as the title says , here 's what i 'm looking for and why ... i have a really old and really nice wooden cabinet that we keep our tv in , but the cabinet is tall and slender , so to put in a widescreen tv normally would mean it would have to be rather small ... so ideally what i 'd want is something with a motor where i could open the cabinet doors and have the tv placed in it vertically and then press a button on the wall / a remote that would cause the tv to push itself out of the cabinet ( to clear the edges of the cabinet ) and then rotate into a horizontal position .
i actually would n't horribly mind having a mount where i 'd have to do this manually , but motorized is always better .
does anyone know of something like this that exists ?
i actually would n't even mind something where it was two separate motors or something , i 'm just hoping this is possible .
any help would be greatly appreciated !
