what are the best sounding dj speakers ?? .
i know this is the diy section , but there seems to be discussion from time to time about dj sound systems and their gear .
i am looking for some great sounding powered dj speakers .
majority of the music will be recorded , not live .
they are for outdoor use ( tailgating ) but only need to cover a small area ( 15 ' - 20 ' in every direction ) .
budget is less than $ 1000 for the pair .
thanks
