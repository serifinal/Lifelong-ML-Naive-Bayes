samsung ln46a750 or sony kdl - 46xbr6 .
i am looking to purchase a new 46 " flat panel lcd tv for my living room .
i am stuck between the samsung ln46a750 and the sony kdl - 46xbr6 .
both seem like great tvs , but i am not sure which one is best for me .
what i will be using this tv for is sports , connection to a media center , blu - ray , and slight ps3 and 360 usage .
the one issue i have heard about the a750 is its halo effect .
is it that bad of a problem ?
is it worth the extra money to get the a750 when the a650 has the same pq and no halo effect , but 12 - bit video processing compared to the a750 's 16 - bit video processing ?
thanks .
