i am interested in getting a projector but i am worried about the day time light .
i live in the on campus apartments at school and wanted to look into a 1080p projector , more than likely the mitsubishi hc4900 .
theres plenty of room to easily have a 100 + inch screen , but i am not too sure how the projector will look during the day .
it will be impossible to `` black out '' the room in the day time , but it gets pretty much pitch black at night so thats not a problem , however the room is n't that bright during the day .
theres just some maybe 4 foot wide by 2 foot windows up near the roof that shines through into the room in the morning and then theres a giant glass sliding door near where i would like to project the image .
do you guys think i would be able to get away with a decent image during the day ?
also it would be really awesome if someone has pictures of their home setups playing a movie during the day with natural light coming in .
thank you so much for the help .
