help with decsion on pio 5010hd vs new lg .
upgrading my system after 6 years and moving away from xbr lcd to plasma .
i have an opportunity to purchase 720p 50 " elite ( 5010hd ? )
at approx .
$ 2,300 from an authorized dealer vs waiting to see if the new lg 's and panasonic 1080p offerings would be a better choice ( 800u and lg60 ) .
i " ll be sitting about 9 feet from the screen and was advised by a friend that i am likely not to see differences in 720p vs 1080p at that distance and would love the pio picture .
thanks for any advice .
btw -- i 'll likely be getting the 94 elite receiver as i ca n't wait for the new line .
