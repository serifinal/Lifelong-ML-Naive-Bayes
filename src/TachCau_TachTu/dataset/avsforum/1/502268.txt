help me figure out what i need to replace my sd - 6109c .
so i am currently using a toshiba sd - 6109c dvd receiver .
it has a built - in dvd player , but i have n't used that part in years ( i use stand alone players ) .
normally , i 'm a " ai n't broke , do n't fix it " guy , but i 'm finding the 6109c is a pain with my hd devices .
i want to keep the price between $ 500 and $ 800 .
i have a 55 " 1080i rptv which has 1 dvi input and 3 component but no hdmi .
my tv does not support 720p , only 480i / p and 1080i .
however , i 'm aiming to get a 55 " + 1080p lcdtv via hdmi / vga / component by the end of 2009 .
my speakers are a set of bose double - cubes for l / c / r and infinity 's for rears .
they all handle 100 watts and a powered sub with a coax connection .
i 'm not using the acoustamass module .
i connect my tw 8300hd - dvr to my tv via an hdmi - dvi cable , audio to my 6109c via optical .
philips dvp - 5992 to tv via component and audio to 6109c via coax .
wii to tv via component , audio to 6109c via rca .
xbox 360 elite to tv via component , audio to 6109c via rca .
i would like to run the dvr , dvp and 360 elite to the receiver via hdmi and be able to use an hdmi - dvi cable to the tv .
the i 'd also like to run the wii 's component to the receiver and have it output through the hdmi to the tv .
radio would also be nice , but it 's not required .
my goal is to make switching between devices really simple as my wife is getting annoyed that she ca n't figure out the current configuration .
i 've looked around and just do n't have the brain power after work to figure av stuff out .
so , i 'm open to suggestions .
i 'm not brand loyal or watt hungry .
i 'm getting 50x5 right now and it 's plenty .
what do you all think and thanks for the help .
