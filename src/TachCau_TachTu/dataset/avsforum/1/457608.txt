how do i hook this up ? .
major av newbie here , and i have a fairly simple question that i need help with before i start purchasing cables that i do n't need or that wo n't work .
please bare with my lack of savviness ( terminology ) as i try to lay out my situation as simply as possible ... preface : not only am i poor , but my equipment is all older ( 2 + years ) and low end .
ultimate goal : to have my pc media center deliver sound through my home theater ( picture already works through 15 pin hd d - sub ) .
my question ( s ) : is there a cable that i can purchase to connect from my pc media center 's spdif coaxial out ( orange ) , into my television 's available rca audio line in ( red and white ) , so that when i 'm using my vga input ( 15 pin hd d - sub ( hd - 15 ) for the picture ... sound will be delivered from my media center ?
i 'm not worried so much about losing sound quality , just do n't want to buy anything i do n't need .
