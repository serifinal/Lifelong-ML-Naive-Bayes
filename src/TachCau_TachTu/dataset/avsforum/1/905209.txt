.
i am looking for a 40 " - 46 " display .
i currently have an offer on a panasonc 46 " pz850u , but it 's just a little more expensive than i 'd like , and its dimensions are just a little larger than i 'd want .
so , i 've decided to look into an lcd alternative , and am looking at the samsung a650 / a750 series and the sony xbr6 series .
general preference opinions would be nice , but in particular , i 'd like to know : ( 1 ) what exactly is this clouding i 've heard about , particularly on the xbr series ?
is it a feature , or a bug ?
( 2 ) possible bugs aside , has there ever been an objective comparison made between the two ?
