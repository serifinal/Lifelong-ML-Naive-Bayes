totem tribe vs. morel vario ? .
i 'm looking at on - wall ht speaker options ( space constrained ) .
i 've got a short - list down to the totem tribe i ( l / r ) & 3 ( c ) ; or the morel vario on - wall .
i also looked at the bg radia 17i / 18i , although i heard the morel vario were better .
i 'm located in colorado , and having a hard time finding demo locations , although will be out in la in a few weeks so hoping to demo some then .
any recommendations or suggestions between these options , or others that i might have missed ?
