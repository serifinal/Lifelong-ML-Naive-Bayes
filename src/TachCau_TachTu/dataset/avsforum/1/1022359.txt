incremental zoom and overscan on lcds .
i am researching to buy a flat panel high definition display ( probably lcd ) and one of my requirements is to have an incremental zoom feature.don ' t get me wrong.i am a strong advocate of oar.i never intend to watch any movie or whatever video other than on it 's original aspect ratio.but from what i understand incremental zoom might be important while watching non anamorphic 4:3 letter - boxed dvd ( this means it gets window - boxed on wide - screen 16:9 displays ) and criterion 's ( video distribution co. ) window - boxed 4:3 dvds ( few of their classic academy - ratio - film video releases are window - boxed to compensate for over scan ) .
i am assuming there wont be over-scan [ by default ] on the panel i will be buying ( this is my other requirement ) .
so what i figured is if the tv set has incremental zoom feature : 1 .
in the case of the window - boxed 4:3 criterion dvds , it would be possible to zoom the video without cropping any content .
as another solution to the problem what about enabling over-scan on the display to a certain percentage , say 7 % , to correct the window - boxed criterion dvds , do lcds and plasmas have optional over-scan ?
if so is it possible to select the percentage ?
( for example from 0 to 10 % ) .
2 .
in the case of non anamorphic dvd , it would be possible to remove the upper - bars and only the side - bars would remain ( it would be only pillar - boxed instead of window - boxed after zooming incrementally ) .
note that no content would be lost or cropped .
please , tell me if there is such thing as an incremental zoom feature in flat - panel displays ?
