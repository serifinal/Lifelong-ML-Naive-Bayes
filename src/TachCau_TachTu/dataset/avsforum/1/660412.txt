samsung 630 vs sony w4100 .
i am still on the fence between these 2 sets now that a firmware is available to fix the sparkles problem on the sony sets .
anyway , i have ordered a 630 from amazon , but am still waiting for it to be shipped .
i would like to know thoughts and opinions on which set would be most beneficial to me .
i am not a gamer , and hardly ever play video games .
the majority of the tv use will be for hd viewing , dvds , and lots and lots of sports .
i occasionally watch sd channels as well .
i ca n't seem to make up my mind .
i know some have stated that sony will give a more clean / crisp picture with more detail , while samsung has better colors .
what are your thoughts in this matter .
i realize i have to make the final choice and determine what i think is best since i am the one who has to live with it , but i would like to hear some thoughts / opinions on both sets .
if i knew for a fact that the 630 was more like a 650 rather than a 550 , it would make my decision much easier .
thanks a lot for your input ...
