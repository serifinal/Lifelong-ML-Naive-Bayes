.
i 'm considering a hp since i want to get a big screen , i.e. 2.7 m wide scope screen , using zoom to fill the image , and still maintain high brightness .
i will have a dedicated theather so it should be possible to place the projector and viewers to take advantage of the gain .
however , i 'm worried about the quality of the image .
as far as i have learned , there are no sparklies and no hotspotting .
how about color reproduction and resolution ?
is it possible to calibrate to get perfect colors on the hp or is there some kind of push or unusual behaviour of the material ?
can a hp be comparable to a studiotek in these two areas ?
in other words , is there any incitament to get the studiotek instead ?
are there any other unusual quirks about the image from the hp ?
if there are major drawbacks , i might have to consider going smaller and swapping to a studiotek or similar screen , but i rather stay big ...
