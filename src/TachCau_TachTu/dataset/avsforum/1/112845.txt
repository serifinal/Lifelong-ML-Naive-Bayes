need help choosing sam ln46a650 or sony kdl - 46xbr6 .
i need help choosing between the two , what has the best pq and best 120hz and motion , the only thing i think is holding me back from the samsung is the ability to auto crop the black bars when view some 4:3 content , b / c some hd contect is not on 16:9 and the philips lcd does have automatic options that will auto crop the black bars both side and top / bottom , i do not show that option with the samsung i do show with the sony versions looking through thier manuals , but the sony is about 300 - 500 more would it be worth going to the sony , thank you .
