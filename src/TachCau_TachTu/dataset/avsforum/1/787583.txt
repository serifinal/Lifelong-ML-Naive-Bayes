lcd or plasma - pc monitor and more .
looks like i 'm going to go with a lcd display of some sort .
thank you everyone for your input .
moderators : if you see this feel free to close this topic .
there were some other threads on the subject , but they were all fairly old .
i figured with all the improvements going on within the tv world in general it warranted some new discussion .
so here are my uses : laptop monitor - gaming / media / programming / web browsing / whatever else you can do on a computer console gaming - 360 / ps3 / wii / maybe some older systems but probably not movies - hd - dvd / blu - ray / dvd tv - football mainly so the question is - lcd or plasma ?
my only real concern with plasma is ir / burn in when using it as a pc monitor .
if it was n't for that i would have probably already bought plasma .
i figured with the way plasmas are going now days i would get some input from some people who probably know more then i do .
so , post your opinion and reasons why .
if you want to recommend some specific models feel free .
i 'm trying to stay under $ 2,000 ( college budget ... ) so please take that into consideration if you recommend a tv .
