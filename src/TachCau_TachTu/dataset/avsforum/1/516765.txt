which 2008 model lcd has the least amount of lag ? .
i know that this is a question that is almost impossible to answer but i 'm looking for a tv for gaming and want an lcd set with the least amount of lag .
i have been using a sharp 46d92u for a year now and found lag to be a non-issue with this set .
i 've been playing games like rock band and guitar hero without having to touch the in - game calibration to fixed any perceived lag .
i 've read that sharp lcd 's in general have been highly favored by gamers because of its low lag .
i know most lcds , older and newer , have some kind of gaming mode that minimizes delay .
however , more recently , i have seen on brochures that they are more heavily marketing this feature than they were for last years models .
this leads me to believe that video lag could be more prevelant on the current generation of lcd tvs , likely due to video processing features on the new sets ( like 120hz ) .
this is a very similar trend thats been happening with current generation receivers ( audio lag / delays ) which also has to cope with more processing features .
i 'm getting worried because i am upgrading to a new set and have been reading reports of lag on top lcds like a650 ( even when gaming mode is turned on ) .
so can anyone point me to any models that have the least amount of lag or least number of reports on this issue ?
historically , which brands have been least problematic with lag ?
right now , i am considering a 52 " toshiba xv540 .
normally , i would jump on a sharp set , but the banding problems are too much for me , which is the reason for me upgrading in the first place .
