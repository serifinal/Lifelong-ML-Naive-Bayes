speaker selection question .
i have been looking into getting a new home theater system for a little while .
i do n't know much about audio equipment , my knowledge is mainly in the video part of ht .
i 'm looking at the denon 1909 receiver and i do n't know what speakers i should get .
i do n't know what kind of speakers i should get .
what is a good brand of speakers ?
the denon 1909 receiver is a 7.1 system .
i am not looking to spend over 600 $ on the speakers .
i also want a good quality , good sounding set of speakers .
any help will be greatly appreciated .
