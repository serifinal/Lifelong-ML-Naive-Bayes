klipsch synergy sub-12 .
i have the following setup : onkyo 805 front speakers : def tech bp7006 ( 2 ) center : def tech c / l / r2002 surround / surround rear l / r : bose cube speakers ( 4 ) subwoofer : old polk audio sub ( bout 8 yrs .
old , ca n't find model # , no manual ) blu - ray : panasonic dmp - bd30k ( dolby truehd & dts - hd master audio via bitstream , arriving tomorrow ! )
dimensions : roughly 18x25 w / vaulted cathedral ceiling that is very high .
i do n't have a large budget remaining ( bout 500 max ) as my 805 i got last week and my bd30k arrives tomorrow .
however , i realize the importance of a sub to any ht system , and badly want to upgrade my sub as my current one is boomy , old , and simply does n't provide good sound anymore .
if i go over 500 , i will be forced to wait 8 months til i pay off my new player and amp .
i saw / heard the klipsch synergy sub-12 at best buy .
is this a good buy or do i need to live w / o a decent sub for 10 months to get a hsu / av123 / etc. .
thanks
