samsung hl50a650 vs. olevia 747i .
does anybody have advice on choosing between these two ?
i was originally sold on lcd , but heard great things about the samsung dlp , and the price is right .
i 'm looking for something between 46 and 52 inches and under $ 1400 .
am i missing anything ?
thanks for the help !
