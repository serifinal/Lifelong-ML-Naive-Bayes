philips 42pfl7432d or sharp lc42d64u ?!? i 'm losing sleep !! .
this will be my first hdtv purchase from my current rca 27 " tube .
i have narrowed down to these 2 !
i will be watching mainly sports , movies , and some sd tv .
and of course hdtv .
which one of these would you guys purchase ?
right now my local bb has the philips on clearance for $ 1300 and i can get $ 30 / month off my directv bill for 12 months .
the sharp it seems i can get delivered for about $ 1400 if i buy today ( online ) .
here are my main issues .
philips - ambilight seems like a neat thing to me i guess .
the price is right + the directv deal .
seems a bit bulky to me and the stats are slightly inferior to the sharp .
like 130 lbs .
with stand i read somewhere ?!
that right ?!
eek .
sharp - i 'm in love with the looks / bezel .
the depth and weight are amazing .
the picture is virtually identical with the similar things i 've seen displayed on them in store .
i honestly do n't know which one to purchase , and if i want the philips , they have 7 left , so i need to jump on it quickly .
just not sure if i want to spend less but get more directv than i will if i get the sharp or get more tv with the sharp but less programming .
btw , this will be hooked up to an upscaling dvd player and the hd receiver from directv .
somebody help me decide !
i have been reading and reading through threads on both of these !
ca n't make up my mind !
