benq mp512st test - your opinion ? .
i was looking for tests or reviews about the benq mp512st .
there seems to be none on this site and also on other sites and forum i did n't find too much information .
so i would like to ask your opinion about this projector .
the reason is that i got my hands on this device as my friend 's father bought one for his office and we got the chance to test it a little during the weekend .
it has a resolution of 800x600 , 2200 ansi lumen and offers short - throw technology .
that 's cool as we placed the projector right in front of the wall ( 1 meter ) and had still a large enough picture .
we played a dvd on it , watched pictures from the digital camera and attached the wii to play tennis .
our impression was that it is quite useful for playing games and home entertainment .
and as the price is quite affordable ( if forgot the exact price but was something like 600 usd ?? )
it might be a good choice for newbies who freshly step into the projector topic .
and it looked quite nice as it is not the standard black but has a silver - white surface which gives it a modern and stylish looking .
what i am not able to evaluate is weather a 1024x768 resolution would be better and if yes , what would be the difference .
so if anybody could answer this question and give me some advice on the benq mp512st , that would be great .
thanks !
