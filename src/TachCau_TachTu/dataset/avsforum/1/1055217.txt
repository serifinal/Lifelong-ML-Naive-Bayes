what kind of screen , where and how do mount ? .
hi there , so i just stumbled across a home theater store the other day and after a quick look round , i started to play with the idea of getting a projector again , maybe a mitsu hc1500 or the opto hd70 .
my problem is where i can put my screen . .
i currently have a mitsu 46 '' lcd which sits on an ikea av bench .
i have nht c4s either side of the bench and am due to have a c3c speaker in the next few weeks .
so obviously the screen has to go in front of the tv so what are my options ?
should i get a portable ?
or maybe a fixed screen with some kind of stand to so that i can put it onto the av bench whenever i want to watch a movie .
i have high a high slanted ceiling -lrb- plus i 'm in rented accomotation -rrb- so ceiling mounting really is n't an option .
here are a couple of pics : -lrb- oh , and yes i know it 's a mess .
i 'm just waiting for my emotiva lmc-1 to arrive to go back into that bottom left slot .
i sold my nad t753 last week and just waiting for the replacement ! -rrb-
