pioneer dv - 410v - k - need advice on new purchase .
i 'm in the process of upgrading my equipment and just purchased a samsung ln40a450 ( 720p / 1080i ) and yamaha yht - 290 ( receiver + speaker / sub package ) .
i 'm also in the market for a decent upconverting dvd player to pair with the new setup - budget is $ 100cdn and below .
i 'm currently looking at the pioneer dv - 410v - k for $ 99cdn at places like best buy .
any other brands / models below the $ 100cdn price point that i should consider ?
the pioneer seems to have a good reputation and comparable image quality to more expensive players .
will i have any regrets buying a player with coaxial only for digital out ?
i plan on sending bitstream to the receiver for decoding .
thanks .
