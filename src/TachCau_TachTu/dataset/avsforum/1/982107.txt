pioneer dv-410v-k - need advice on new purchase .
i 'm in the process of upgrading my equipment and just purchased a samsung ln40a450 -lrb- 720p/1080i -rrb- and yamaha yht-290 -lrb- receiver + speaker/sub package -rrb- .
i 'm also in the market for a decent upconverting dvd player to pair with the new setup - budget is $ 100cdn and below .
i 'm currently looking at the pioneer dv-410v-k for $ 99cdn at places like best buy .
any other brands/models below the $ 100cdn price point that i should consider ?
the pioneer seems to have a good reputation and comparable image quality to more expensive players .
will i have any regrets buying a player with coaxial only for digital out ?
i plan on sending bitstream to the receiver for decoding .
thanks .
