.
i own a sharp lc42d64u .
when watching standard definition tv ( my provider is dish network ) , a small , thin band of " static " ( for lack of a better term ) appears at the top of the picture .
this phenomena does not occur when watching hd programming .
is this an issue with my tv or dish network ?
in either case , is there a known fix ?
