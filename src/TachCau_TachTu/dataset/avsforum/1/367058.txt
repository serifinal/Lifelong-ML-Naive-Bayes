appleseed : ex machina on 360 - who 's watching ? .
first , i 'm not much of an anime fan .
but i have fond memories of akira , which i think included a great story .
i heard about the plot first , and thought it was a animated film worth seeing - and i was right .
i enjoyed it alot , and thought it was well done - for a cartoon .
now i have the same type of intrigue about appleseed : machina .
the look of it seems cool .
but , from what i 've read , the story seems interesting as well .
so , does anyone have any insight about this film .
is this the first of appleseed , or are there previous books or shows about it ?
has anyone seen this film ?
i 'll be downloading this one , and hopefully it 'll be as good as akira .
