what is best for watching hockey ? .
the main use of whatever television i buy will be for bluray / dvd , videogames , sports ( in particular hockey and football ... emphasis on the hockey ) .
my greatest concern is for watching hockey in both hd and sd .
i am looking to upgrade from my 720p / 1080i 51 " projection to either an lcd or plasma .
i am aware of some of the various pitfalls of both technologies .... blurring ( which seems subjective ) , contrast , " white " tends to look better on lcd 's where as " black " in regards to detail tends to look better on plasma ..... both facts explainable by the inherent nature of each respective tech .
if i get an lcd it will be one with 120hz tech , 5:5 pull down ( as opposed to 3:2 ) , a response time of 8ms or better ... etc. . .
etc if i get a plasma .... not sure ... i would like to say kuro , but it 's out of the price range at the moment and i will not buy a panasonic .
so if there is anyone out there who has watched a good amount of hockey on their lcd / plasma over the last year ( in hd and or sd ) , i would appreciate your input .
also if i do get any responses could you let me know what tv you have ( ie : make and model ) .
thanks in advance
