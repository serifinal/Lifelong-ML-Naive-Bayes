help me choose - toshiba 42xv540 lcd vs panasonic th42px80u plasma .
i posted earlier with a few other models i was considering and now have it down to the two above .
i looked at both in the store and had a hard time deciding .
the toshiba was ' brighter ' but that may have had as much to do with setting than anything else .
a few key facts : i still wath sd television and dvd 's i have an rch hi def cable box no blu ray or upconverting dvd yet ( but eventually will probably have one ) no video game system yet ( but again , will eventually have one ) i usually keep my tv 's a long time ( my current sony 27 " crt is almost 20 years old ) .
i will be watching anywhere between 5 and 9 feet .
i am using reward points so that the panasonic is essentially 1/3 less than the toshiba ( though not in real dollars ) .
i realize the panasonic is only 720p / 768 but i also believe that that is the same as 1080i .
i am still drawn to the toshiba as it has the latest feature ; 1080p , 120 mhz , but not sure if all that matters in real world use .
so i am in the same dllemna as others : plasma vs lcd and 720 vs 1080 .
thanks for your help .
