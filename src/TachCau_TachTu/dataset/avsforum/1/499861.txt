looking for 720 p 42 '' lcd .
i 've read threads , collected information until my eyes have bled , and have narrowed my choices down to several sets in the sharp , toshiba , and lg lines .
samsung does n't make a 42 '' set -lrb- although i love their 40 '' 650 series -rrb- and sony just appears to be more expensive than it 's really worth -lrb- if someone feels differently , let me know -rrb- .
my big decision tree comes at the 720p vs 1080p level .
i plan on using it to watch directv with a regular old dvd player , but would not rule out hdtv package or blu-ray in the future .
right now i do n't game , but as the boys get older i might look at getting something for us to play .
do n't have any intention of hooking up a computer to it .
i 'm sitting around 8-10 feet away from the set .
i spent hours in stores looking at sets , and sometimes i see a difference between the 720p/1080p and sometimes i do n't .
i have heard that a sd signal on a 1080p set can actually look worse than on a 720 set .
i 'm wondering if there 's a reason to buy a 1080p resolution on a set this small .
if there 's a sticky on here that points me to the discussion , please send it to me .
i 'm wondering if these newer 1080p sets look better because of other features , and not simply the resolution .
