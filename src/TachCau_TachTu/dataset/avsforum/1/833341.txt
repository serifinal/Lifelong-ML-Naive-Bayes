call all epson users .
what screens are you using ?
gray / white / dark gray .
hi there , i 've searched through the threads but i ca n't seem to get a full of sense of which screens people are using for the epson 720 .
i 'm looking at picking one up in the next few months and as it is noted as a relative bright projector i was wondering if people are going with white or gray screens .
it will be generally used in subdued light and all signs seem to point to me using a gray screen but i was wondering what everyone else was using .
your setup details would greatly be appreciated .
