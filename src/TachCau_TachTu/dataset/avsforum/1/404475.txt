canon fs-h37u 37mm filter set vs. non-canon third-party 37mm filter set i have a canon hf100 camcorder , and i plan to use a filter to protect the lens from dust , moisture , and scratches .
i would like to know your opinions and which one -lrb- canon or 3rd-party -rrb- performs better ?
the canon fs-h37u 37mm filter set costs $ 60 shipped while the third-party one on ebay costs less than $ 30 shipped .
use of third-party filters will not void the camcorder warranty : quote : originally posted by canon -lsb- canon does not -rsb- recommend the use of third party filters for your vixia hf100 .
they are not covered under the warranty , not will any damage caused by their use be covered by the warranty .
it will not , however , actually void your warranty .
