should i get the vizio 37 " or 42 " lcd tv ?
which one is better ? .
from all i 've read , i know the vizio 37 " vx37l is a good tv .
the cnet & pc mag and your reviews were all good .
the vizio 42 " vx42l is $ 148 more at sam 's than the vizio 37 " .
i have a few questions ?
1 ) is there really enough size difference between a 42 " & 37 " tv to justify the price difference ?
2 ) my tv armoire is 42Â 1/2 wide ( with 2 vent / cord holes in the back ) .
the 37 " vizio measures 36.2 " w x 26 " h x 10.4 " d & the 42 " measures 40.5 " w x 28.4 " h x 9.7 " d. i can fit the 42 " but would it be better ventalation wise to get the 37 " ?
3 ) the 37 " vizio seems to have better reviews overall than the vizio 42 " , correct ?
i 'm scared because the cnet review said the 42 " has a " green tinge " and i would be driven nuts by that .
so the 32 " has better performance , does n't it ?
or does it ?
4 ) i 'm debating between buying from dell ( $ 30 cheaper than sams ) and sams .
i 'm thinking maybe it 's better to buy from sam 's because it 's easier to return to the store , should it be defective .
also , dell does n't give any additional warranty ( neither does sam 's ) .
am i right in thinking that the less shipping and jostling a tv gets , the longer it will last .
so it 's better to buy at the store instead of having one shipped ?
5 ) i 'm going to use it as a monitor with my dell diminsion 3000 ( from 04 ' ) with a vga port for use with tv ( not the one for the monitor , and additional one ) .
the vizio 's do n't come with this cord .
dell provides one for $ 25 .
if i do n't buy from dell , what and from where should i get this cord ?
i 'd like an inexpensive , but good one if possible .
also , my living room is very bright during the day and the window treatments ( even with shades ) still make it bright and ca n't be adjusted to make it darker .
i love them and do n't want to replace them .
would the vizio tv 's work well in brightly lit rooms ?
any other help or advice would be appreciated ... thanks !
