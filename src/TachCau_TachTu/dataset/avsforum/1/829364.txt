sharp/samsung/sony 2008 .
hi all , i know this question has been posted numerous times , and i have read countless reviews but . .
i am most likely going to pull the trigger to replace a broken 30 '' crt with a lcd .
we will be mainly sitting 6-8 feet during viewing , and at dinner 14 feet .
the ones i am looking into are samsung ln-40a630 ln-40a650 ln-46a550 sharp lc-c4254u sony unsure of model but a xbr5 from my coworkers who deal with these products they say sony breaks down the most , and quire a few of them sware by samsung .
the sharp brand i was the one initially wanted to get , but now i hear more and more about the banding issue and blacks not being the blackest .
this tv will be mainly used in daytime about 12-13 hrs a day , and might have sun from outside window so seeing glare would kind of kill the picture , -lrb- i know you can turn the tv slightly to fix that -rrb- hope you guys have some good ideas .
thanks , david from nyc
