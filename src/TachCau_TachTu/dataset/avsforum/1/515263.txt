official pioneer sc - 09tx / sc - lx90 owner 's thread .
ok , i 'll be the one to start this since i seem to be the 1st one to get the new sc - 09tx here on the forum i 've been eagerly waiting for the susano since the sept 07 cedia announcement , read everything i could on it and icepower class d amps .
i had preordered it in march it arrived yesterday .
all i 've done so far is check out the unit to make sure it was n't doa and get used to the display .
i have n't hooked up anything to yet and wo n't be until this weekend .
for those that have & liked the touchscreen remote that came with the previous elite flagship avr , the 59txi , i may have some good news : it found out it works with the sc - 09 .
pioneer must be using the same ir codes .
so far , i 've used to to change inputs , surround formats , and change signal sources .
i 'm willing to bet it can also access mcacc & other settings .
so , if you really hate the new remote and are not using a programmable universal remote , there 's an another option .
that 's all for now .
i 'm hoping we see other new owners here this week .... .
