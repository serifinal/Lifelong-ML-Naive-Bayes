i need info on how big a screen i need . .
hello , i 'm not sure where to look but i just need to find out how big of a screen i need to fit in my gameroom which is 15x15 .
i want to be able to go the max as far as size of the screen .
i do n't have a projector at this time but soon i will plan on looking for a 1080p projector to mount on the cieling .
the only thing i have is seating which is about 10 - 12 feet away from the wall i want to mount the screen on .
is there a thread out there or formulas that i need to use to see what size of screen i need ?
thanks greg
