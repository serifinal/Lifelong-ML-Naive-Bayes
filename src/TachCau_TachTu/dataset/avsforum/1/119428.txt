toshiba regza 42rv530u or sharp aquos lc46d64u ? .
which tv would you guys get ?
i currently have the regza 42 " but it has n't been a month yet so i can still return it .
i bought it for $ 1179.99 plus taxes .
through pm and a friend at staples , i can buy the sharp aquos lc46d64u for 1350 plus taxes .
is it worth the switch ?
