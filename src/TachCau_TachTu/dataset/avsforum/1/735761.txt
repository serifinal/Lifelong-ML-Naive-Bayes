samsung led lcd pioneer kuro 5020 pz800 or what ???? .
hi from italy i am really unsure between series 9 and kuro 5020 - i can get the led samsung 46 " 786 for 1800 circa euro or a series 9 for 2100 ( they are equal right ??? ) if yes i will go for the 786 - then the kuro 5090 that i think it s equal to your 5020 but is very expensive here in europe about 3000 euro !!!!!!! so i think that i would buy it from usa , because costs only 1800 euro , but i have to think about delivery and taxes .... ( can u suggest me an internatonal delivery cheap store . .
???? ) - if not what do you suggest ????? previous kuro 5010 ??? panasonic pz 8/800 ??? samsung plasma series 5 6 or 7 ??? or what ......... wait for next models / technology oled exct .......... .
