ln52a580 ,650 or 750 , which one has the least issues ? .
hi all , newbie here , but i 've been reading this forum for a while .
anyway , looking for a new 52 " lcd , i originally wanted the sony w4100 , but i am now pretty certain i want a samsung .
went to bb yesterday and saw a great deal on the 580 , which i read in one of the other threads are only sold at bb .
the pq on this tv looks almost as good as the 650 and 750 , ( at least to me untrained eyes ) and the price was very good .
then there 's the amazon deals w / the free blueray .
if i go this route i am leaning towards the 650 or 750 , being that the price diff is so small now .
couple of questions here , do both tvs have the halo issue ?
sound issue ?
does the 750 sound better than the 650 ?
exlcuding the spec diffs , is one set less problematic than the other ?
is so , in what areas ?
if any of you could guide me on these 3 sets it would be much appreciated .
thanks in advance for your help !
