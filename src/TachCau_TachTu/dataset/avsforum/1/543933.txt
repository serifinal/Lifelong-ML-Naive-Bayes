i have a couple questions for all of you !!! .
hey guys , i 've got a couple questions for you .
i was n't sure what to name the thread . .
anyways , i 'm looking for a reciever on my $ 220 budget but im not sure about all the formats offered and their differences .
i dont get all the dts and dts 6.1 or whatever .
im just a college student trying to learn a little something while i have some time off .
my setup will be used for 40 % gaming , 40 % movies/cable , 20 % music .
im just wanting to get the best reciever possible but im not sure what the current and best format is and what i would need to make it work .
... now i know it may seem like i have a long way to go but i 've done searches and i 'll really appreciate it if we could just take this one step at a time so it helps anyone that would ever need to know this ... and so this post does n't go to the bottom of the page in 2.4 seconds thanks everyone !
