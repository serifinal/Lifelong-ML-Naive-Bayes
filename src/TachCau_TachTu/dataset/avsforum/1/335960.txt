debating on what samsung model to get .... 850 vs 750 .
i figured i would come to the experts and ask this question .
i am looking to upgrade my television to either a samsung ln52a750 or ln52a850 .
looking at the spec sheet on them , the only thing that truly sticks out is the width difference .
the price difference is about $ 500 more for the 850 so i wanted to know if there was anything out there that would make it worth that .
the 750 looked awesome when i saw it in the store .
help on this would be greatly appreciated !
