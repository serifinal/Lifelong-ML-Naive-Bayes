infocus in83 vs. jvc rs1x ... .
which one is better for pc gaming ? .
this will be my second projector , i 'm going to be upgrading from an optoma hd 70 .
i will mostly use it for pc gaming majority of the time , very few movies , mostly concert blu - rays / dvds .
the placement restrictions of the infocus wont be much of an issue.i can light control my room too.i can purchase either one within a few hundred dollars of each other with the infocus being slightly more .
thanks for any input
