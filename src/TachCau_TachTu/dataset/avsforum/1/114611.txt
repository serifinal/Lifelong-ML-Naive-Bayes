pioneer dv - 400v vs pioneer dv - 410v vs sony dvp - ns700h .
i had the 400v a couple of months ago before i returned it back to the store .
the reason why i returned it is because it had grainy pq .
i bought the new sony dvp - ns700h a couple of weeks ago and returned it , because i did not like it .
i had to go to 2 best buy stores to look and buy the 410v , because one of the stores were out of stock and my oppo dv - 983h shipped yesterday .
this comparison was done on a sharp aquos 37 inch lcd tv ( i will be buying a 42 inch tv this summer ) and by memory for the sony dvp - ns700h and 400v .
the audio performace was done with hdmi and my yamaha rx - v1800 receiver .
now here is my comparison on each dvd player , except the oppo dv - 983h since i have not received it and it would not be fair for comparing a $ 399 dvd player to a dvd player that costs under $ 100 .
picture quality and video performace 1 .
pioneer dv - 410v - the best pq against the sony dvp - ns700h and pio dv - 400v .
pq was not grainy at all , it has a sharp and clear image .
colors looked decent .
hqv testing on this dvd player was very solid .
2 .
sony dvp - ns700h - overall not as good as the dv - 410 , but decent .
i noticed artifacts in the pq .
pq has edge enhancement that i can not get rid of and it had a somewhat grainy image .
colors as good as the dv - 410 .
hqv testing was not as good dv - 410 .
3 .
pioneer dv - 400v - very grainy pq , a lot of artifacts .
the worst out of the two other dvd players .
hqv testing was worse than the dvp - ns700h and dv - 410v .
build 1 .
pioneer dv - 410v - excellent build for the price .
2 .
pioneer dv - 400v - good build , but not as good as the dv - 410v , because there is more weight in the dv - 410v .
3 .
sony dvp - ns700h - decent , but not has good as its previous model and not as good as either pioneer dvd player as mentioned here .
audio performace 1 .
pioneer dv - 410v - i feel that the hdmi audio is better with this player than the other 2 dvd players .
hdmi audio is more fuller and dynamic .
2 .
sony dvp - ns700h and pioneer dv - 400v - both sounded the same .
overall 1 .
pioneer has done a great job on the dv - 410v and they improved in all areas that i did not like about the dv - 400v .
2 .
sony dvp - ns700h is just a good basic dvd player .
nothing special about it .
right now i will be staying with the dv - 410v but i should have waited this friday to buy it from best buy because i received a 12 % off coupon from the mail today , maybe they will honor the 12 % off coupon this friday .
the oppo dv - 983 that i ordered will be delivered to me tomorrow .
the big question is : is the oppo dv - 983h worth the extra money from the pioneer dv - 410v ?
