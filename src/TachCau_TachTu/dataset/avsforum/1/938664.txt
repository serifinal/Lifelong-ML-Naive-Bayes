question : samsung a550 / a650 or sony xbr6 .
hey everyone , i am trying to decide on a replacement for my samsung 24 " lcd ( pc monitor ) .
i am looking for a 32 " to wall mount and i am wondering which is my best option .
my primary use will be desktop use ( internet browsing & desktop applications ) , followed by gaming , and occassionally watching bluray movies ( via cheap internal sony sata player ) .
my viewing distance is about 3 - 4 feet .
i have narrowed my search down to these 3 choices : 1 ) samsung ln - 32a550 @ $ 900 2 ) samsung ln - 32a650 @ $ 1000 3 ) sony kdl - 32xbr6 @ $ 1000 ps : i do n't want all the comparison of 120hz vs 60hz , just which would you choose given what i am using it for and price breakdown .
