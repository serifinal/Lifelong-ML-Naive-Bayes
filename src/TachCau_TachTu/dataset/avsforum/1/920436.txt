need help !
lcd or plasma for pc file playback best pq ? .
hi all , i have built a sweet home theater setup ( integra dtr9 .9 , 7.1 speaker setup ( infiniti , focal , martin logan mix ) and have a good htpc that can run i ) via hdmi thru integra or ii ) direct to tv ( via dvi , vga or hdmi ; with dvi to hdmi adapter ) and iii ) thru ps3 .
here 's where i need advice : i am fortunate ( and slaved long hours ) to be able to choose almost any monitor for this dream system .
i 'm currently deciding between the sony and sammy 52 " or larger lcds or a pioneer pro 151fd plasma .
i would prefer not to spend the 2x price of the pio ( especially with neopdp coming out next summer ) , but want the best now .
90 % of my playback is coming through my htpc .
please help me decide if i should go lcd or plasma for this application .
other notes is that i sit a perfect 8.1 feet from the screen ( can accomodate a 60 inch ) and come move the couch forward for a slightly smaller screen :-) please help me out - advice , particular model numbers etc. ... many , many thanks in advance !!!
