yamaha 663 or onkyo 705 or denon ??
or pioneer ?? .
ive read as much posts as my eyes will allow and still cant come to a conclusion .
i bought the onkyo 705 unused display model for $ 380 which i know is a great price .
ive read back and forth the yamaha 663 is better sound quality wise and vice versa .
im new to all of this and there is no store that has all the models to preview side by side .
ive heard of denon and everyone says there great too .
i have a ps3 , kef speakers and an olevia and i just want the best sound quality .
i will only run hdmi and do nt care for upconverting to 1080p as i will not be watching tv , only blu rays and gaming .
i am willing to spend around 500 maybe 6 .
just want a very pleasing sound ( dts - hd , etc ) with music , movies and games , be it harmon kardon , marantz or anyother receiver .
need advice please .
