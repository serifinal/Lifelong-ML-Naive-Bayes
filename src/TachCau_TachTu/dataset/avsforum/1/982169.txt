t.v. can only do 1080i , worth getting blu - ray ? .
i currently have a standard definition denon 3930ci dvd player hooked to my kds - r50xbr150 " grand wega ?
sxrd television .
i was considering buying a blu - ray player , however my television will only do 1080i .
will i get any benefit if i upgrade from my standard definition ( but highly rated ) dvd player ?
optically , can someone see the difference between a blu - ray hooked to a 1080p television verses a 1080i televison ?
