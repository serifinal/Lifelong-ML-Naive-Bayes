u-verse or fios if you had a choice and why .
if you had a choice of u-verse or fios , which would you pick and why .
does one have a better long term outlook .
i can get fios right now but do n't trust the people trying to sell it to me .
my mom lives approx. 15 miles from me and just got u-verse but she does n't know what it really does yet .
i saw a few hd channels today and looks similar to her direct tv .
i want the best technology but i want something long term .
i am happy with my direct tv but video on demand looks interesting .
maybe get howard tv , etc. .
