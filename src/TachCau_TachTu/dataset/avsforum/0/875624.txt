.
well after waiting almost two years for my new home , i 'm finally in !!!! i 've been reading and posting here for almost two years to the day , and after filling my tiny apartment with a / v components over the past two years , the day has finally come to move my toys to a dedicated " man - cave " ... in a real house .
... a little background my humble beginnings here at avs , sept 2006 , 1 bedroom 500 sq.ft .
apartment .
a 10 year old 27 " mitsubishi crt tv , yamaha 5.1 pro logic surround sound w / yamaha 8 " powered sub older mission bookshelf speakers and a yamaha progressive scan sd dvd player .
my first hdtv purchase sept. 08/2006 pioneer pdp - 5070hd , motorola hd stb ( dct - 6200 ) ... then things started snow - balling ( ohoh , hang on tight ! )
followed shortly by an xbox 360 w / hd dvd drive , ps3 , yamaha rx - v661 for hdmi and 7.1 audio then in the spring 07 ' i added some better tower speakers ( mission ) and a real sub ( velodyne ) i ditched the xbox hd - dvd add - on in favour of a toshiba hd - a2 hd dvd player for lossless audio and better upconversion picked up a second pioneer plasma ( pdp - 5080hd ) kuro in the spring of 08 ' , so i could move the 5070 to the master bedroom .
another avr upgrade ( rx - v1800 ) , found a second matching 12 " velodyne sub on sale , half price !
and added another motorola hd dvr ( dct - 3416 ) my ex-bachelor pad just a couple weeks before moving day to the new home current component list : video epson powerlite home cinema 1080ub ( ultra black ) projector * new * 120 " powered richvision 1.3 gain screen w / wireless remote * new * pioneer kuro pdp - 5080hd plasma motorola hd dvr ( dct 3416 ) toshiba hd - a2 hd dvd ps3 60gig ( fried hdmi port ) ps3 80gig * new * xbox pro 360 ( rrod ) xbox 360 elite * new * audio yamaha rx - v3900 * new * 9.2 speaker configuration ( 7.2 + 2 front presence ) mission speakers m31i front presence m34i l / r towers m32i center m31i surrounds m31i back surrounds dual velodyne dps - 12 sub 's spares yamaha rx - v1800 pioneer pdp5070 - hd ( master bedroom t.v. ) samsung 26 " lcd ( kitchen t.v. ) motorola dct 6200 hd stb ( master bedroom ) yamaha rx - v661 avr yamaha 8 " powered sub and a bunch of mission m30 speakers pioneer and yamaha dvd players my new home new built , two storey victorian with un-finished basement 3 bedroom , 2.5 bath and about 700 sq.ft .
per level a former show home , it came fully landscaped , decorated , furnished and with all stainless steel appliances the plan for the basement man - cave is to start with my 50 " plasma and eventually set up for a projector / screen ( 96 " - 120 " ) now for the fun stuff : using google sketchup back to reality ... here 's where i 'm at now finished stairwell leading down to the future ht . . . dedicated theater area 14 ' - 5 " w x 16 ' - 9 " d x 7 ' - 9 " h = aprox 250 sq.ft .
/ 1900 cubic feet i cant afford to totally finish the space right away , so this is going to be a long drawn out work - in - progress , and to make things even more difficult , i will need to work around all my gear after the room is full of furniture and av equipment .
not ideal i know , but its either that or leave everything in storage for another year or two ... that just ai nt happenin ' my first home theater ... my kuro plasma just was n't enough , so i made my home movie experience larger than life with a projector !
