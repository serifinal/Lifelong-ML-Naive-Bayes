.
well after waiting almost two years for my new home , i 'm finally in !!!! i 've been reading and posting here for almost two years to the day , and after filling my tiny apartment with a/v components over the past two years , the day has finally come to move my toys to a dedicated `` man-cave '' ... in a real house .
... a little background my humble beginnings here at avs , sept 2006 , 1 bedroom 500 sq.ft .
apartment .
a 10 year old 27 '' mitsubishi crt tv , yamaha 5.1 pro logic surround sound w/yamaha 8 '' powered sub older mission bookshelf speakers and a yamaha progressive scan sd dvd player .
my first hdtv purchase sept. 08/2006 pioneer pdp-5070hd , motorola hd stb -lrb- dct-6200 -rrb- ... then things started snow-balling -lrb- ohoh , hang on tight ! -rrb-
followed shortly by an xbox 360 w/hd dvd drive , ps3 , yamaha rx-v661 for hdmi and 7.1 audio then in the spring 07 ' i added some better tower speakers -lrb- mission -rrb- and a real sub -lrb- velodyne -rrb- i ditched the xbox hd-dvd add-on in favour of a toshiba hd-a2 hd dvd player for lossless audio and better upconversion picked up a second pioneer plasma -lrb- pdp-5080hd -rrb- kuro in the spring of 08 ' , so i could move the 5070 to the master bedroom .
another avr upgrade -lrb- rx-v1800 -rrb- , found a second matching 12 '' velodyne sub on sale , half price !
and added another motorola hd dvr -lrb- dct-3416 -rrb- my ex-bachelor pad just a couple weeks before moving day to the new home current component list : video epson powerlite home cinema 1080ub -lrb- ultra black -rrb- projector * new * 120 '' powered richvision 1.3 gain screen w / wireless remote * new * pioneer kuro pdp-5080hd plasma motorola hd dvr -lrb- dct 3416 -rrb- toshiba hd-a2 hd dvd ps3 60gig -lrb- fried hdmi port -rrb- ps3 80gig * new * xbox pro 360 -lrb- rrod -rrb- xbox 360 elite * new * audio yamaha rx-v3900 * new * 9.2 speaker configuration -lrb- 7.2 + 2 front presence -rrb- mission speakers m31i front presence m34i l/r towers m32i center m31i surrounds m31i back surrounds dual velodyne dps-12 sub 's spares yamaha rx-v1800 pioneer pdp5070-hd -lrb- master bedroom t.v. -rrb- samsung 26 '' lcd -lrb- kitchen t.v. -rrb- motorola dct 6200 hd stb -lrb- master bedroom -rrb- yamaha rx-v661 avr yamaha 8 '' powered sub and a bunch of mission m30 speakers pioneer and yamaha dvd players my new home new built , two storey victorian with un-finished basement 3 bedroom , 2.5 bath and about 700 sq.ft .
per level a former show home , it came fully landscaped , decorated , furnished and with all stainless steel appliances the plan for the basement man-cave is to start with my 50 '' plasma and eventually set up for a projector/screen -lrb- 96 '' -120 '' -rrb- now for the fun stuff : using google sketchup back to reality ... here 's where i 'm at now finished stairwell leading down to the future ht ... dedicated theater area 14 ' -5 `` w x 16 ' -9 `` d x 7 ' -9 `` h = aprox 250 sq.ft .
/ 1900 cubic feet i cant afford to totally finish the space right away , so this is going to be a long drawn out work-in-progress , and to make things even more difficult , i will need to work around all my gear after the room is full of furniture and av equipment .
not ideal i know , but its either that or leave everything in storage for another year or two ... that just aint happenin ' my first home theater ... my kuro plasma just was n't enough , so i made my home movie experience larger than life with a projector !
