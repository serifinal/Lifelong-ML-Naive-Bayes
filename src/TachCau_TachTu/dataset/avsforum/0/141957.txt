ati 45xx , bit perfect , and vista .
hi , i 'm now the happy owner of an ati 4550 .
i have installed the catalyst drivers ( 8.12 , the latest i think ) , and the realtek high defitinion audio drivers ( 2.0.3 ) .
i 've managed , as well , to get dts and ac3 trhough the hdmi to my receiver ( a marantz sr4001 ) .
lpcm * seems * to be working as well ( tried it with powerdvd ) , although i 'm not that sure .
the receiver does show all the pcm channels being sent though .
now , i 'm trying to get bitperfect .
i think i ; ve managed to get pcm stereo to my receiver when using foobar 2k and the wasapi component ( the vista volume slider stops working ) , but when i try to play a dts wav file ( ie , 44khz ) , all i get is noise ( again , using foobar and wasapi ) .
i can see in the configuration of the hdmi device that it can output 48khz and 44khz ( as well as other formats ) , but i do n't know if that 's for real .
i would like this to work , as i have another audio board installed just to get this , and working fine ( a riviera with cmedia drivers ) , but i 'd like to have everything going through one cable , so that i do n't have to switch between inputs ( and i could use that audio board somewhere else ! ) .
did any of you managed to get bitperfect output with this ati card ?
thanks , - n.
