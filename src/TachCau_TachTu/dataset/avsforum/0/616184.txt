sd dvd pq : ps3 vs. samsung 2550 vs. panasonic bd35 / 55 vs. oppo 983/981 vs. tosh7990 .
three sections / questions i 'm hoping to get some help with ... all in regards to playing on a hidef display ... 1 .
i 'd love to get ratings on these players when it comes to sd dvd pq : ( scale of 1 to 10 ) ps3 : samsung 2550 : panasonic bd35 / 55 : oppo 983 : oppo 981 : ( and if anyone can provide screen captures or images or something of any / all of the above displaying the same sd dvd , that would be awesome ! )
i will most likely be getting a panasonic 50pz800u hidef display ... 2 .
please also rate the first three above in regards to bluray pq ( if you know -- i also posted in the bluray forum to ask about this though ... ) .
3 .
i have a toshiba sd - 7990 sd dvd player ( specs , which says it does 480p , 720p , 1080i , and 1080p hdmi upscaling -- and also says it has the dcdi by faroudja -- i do n't know if that 's just for deinterlacing or if that 's actually the chipset ? ) .
how will this rate in comparison to upscaling sd dvd to the players listed above ?
the oppo 981 's deinterlacing is listed as being done by the dcdi by faroudja ( but i do n't know if the toshiba actually has the faroudja chipset ) .
any help is appreciated ?
thanks !
