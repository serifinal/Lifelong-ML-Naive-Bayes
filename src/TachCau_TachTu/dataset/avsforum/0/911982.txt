sky ceiling without using a mural painter ! .
hello , i am looking for a solution to turn a art niche ( 3 ' x 6 ' barrel ceiling feature ) into a sky .
the niche already has fiber rope and looks good .
a sky or even italian themed ceiling feature is what we are after .
if i could dim the lights down a star ceiling could even come into play ?
any ideas - do not want to pay 700 + for a graphic vynil but more like a wallpaper in sections .
thanks , tyler
