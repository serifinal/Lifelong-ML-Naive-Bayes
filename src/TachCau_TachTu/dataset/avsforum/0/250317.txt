which set up to go with ?
anyone .
i received 2 proposals from 2 different companies this is what they suggested .
option 1 : pioneer pdp 5010hd plasma pioneer vsx92 receiver mythos eights on wall front speakers ( l , r , c ) supercube ii subwoofer speakercraft aimeights three ( rears ) panansonic bd - 30 blue ray option 2 : pioneer pdp 5010hd plasma denon avr 2808 surround receiver sony bdps 300 blue ray speakercraft tantra three front speakers ( l , r , c ) speakercraft bass x-dual8 subwoofer speakercraft aimeights three ( rears ) along with wall mount , mx350 remote or harmony one ( i tend to like harmony one ) .
panamax 4300 which makes most sense assuming price is not an issue .
2nd option was offered to me at about $ 800 less then first option .
