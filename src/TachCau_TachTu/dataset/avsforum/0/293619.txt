how to get shows off of a replaytv hd with a computer ? .
im not familiar with all of the utilities , and stuff for replaytvs .
is it possible to get my shows off of the hd if i put it in my computer ?
i know you can upgrade drives , i have done that before , but is there any way to get the shows off of the drive onto my computer ?
