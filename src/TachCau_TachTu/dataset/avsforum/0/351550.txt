i 've been searching and searching but i have n't been able to find anything that explains this very well .
i am not talking about amp .
forget amp .
i am talking about the ability to take a 24fps / hz source and use 5:5 pulldown to display each frame 5 times and thereby reduce ( get rid of ?? )
the juddering present in lcd 's .
first , i ca n't find anything that confirms that the lnxxa650 can do this ( or for that matter the 750 , 850 ) , so does it in fact do this ?
it 's awfully conspicuous that this information is n't easy to find ... second , even if it does do this , how could i actually take advantage of this ?
i currently have comcast , and the cable box outputs at 60hz , so when i 'm watching a movie broadcast in hd , it 's already gone through the 3:2 pulldown so it can be output at 60hz , right ?
so in that case , there 's nothing the lcd can do , because even if it did support 5:5 pulldown , it needs a source that 's outputting at 24fps / hz , correct ?
does any blu - ray player , or dvd player , or really anything , support outputting content at 24fps / hz ?
and , if there is , can someone confirm that that 's the only way the lcd could take advantage of 5:5 pulldown ( if it indeed did support it ) ?
