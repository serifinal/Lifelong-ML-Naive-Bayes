6 or 8 seats - what do you think ? .
hey all , i 'm at the riser construction point and i do n't know which way to go .
i originally was hoping to get 8 seats ( berk 088s ) in the theater but now i 'm wondering if i 'm trying to squeeze too many seats in .
i 'm wondering if 6 seats would be better .
the theater is 141 inches wide column - to - column and 156 inches wide wal - to - wall .
the attached layout shows the two seating configurations and the aisle widths i 'd be left with .
although i 'd love to get 8 seats in there , would it be better with only six ?
what do you guys think ?
thanks , andy
