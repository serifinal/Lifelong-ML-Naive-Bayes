samsung pn42a450 vs lg 42pg20 ??????? .
i am unable to view these tv 's in person so i 'm looking for opinions from people that have seen these displays .
the only thing i really care about is which of these has the best pq ?
the lg appears to have a better contrast ratio and more input & display resolutions but i assume the specs on plasmas are exaggerated like other displays .
the lg has a 30 bit xd engine video processor and an optical input where as the samsung has a dnie + video processor and a headphone jack .
which one people ... please and thanks .
