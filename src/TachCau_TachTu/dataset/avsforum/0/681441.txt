which is better : thermaltake dh101 or silverstone lc16m ? .
ok , here 's my dilemma .
i want to move everything over to a good looking htpc case that does n't break the bank and have narrowed the choice down to either the thermaltake dh101 or the silverstone lc16m , but ca n't decide and need a little help .
also , would both of these fit a diamond radeon 3850 , sycthe mini ninja and the lg ggc - h20l bd / hd dvd combo drive ?
i 'm also open to any other suggestions !
thanks in advance !
