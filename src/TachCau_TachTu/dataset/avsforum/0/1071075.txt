how would you frame this wall ? .
i have been lurking here for a couple of years and i am finally ready to start on my dedicated theater room in my unfinished basement .
my raw space measures about 23 ' by 18 ' 2 " with 9 ' ( concrete ) floor to joist height .
one of the walls is a concrete half - wall ( about 26 " high ) with conventional 2x4 framing atop that half - wall .
i would appreciate some feedback from the group on how you would frame this wall ( it will be one of the side walls of the theater ) .
the framing is set back about 4 " from the inside edge of the half - wall .
i will be applying for a building permit so framing must be to code .
i am not that concerned with losing a little room width ( up to a foot ) as i plan two rows of four seats and i think 16 ' - 17 ' will accomodate that arrangement .
any help will be greatly appreciated .
