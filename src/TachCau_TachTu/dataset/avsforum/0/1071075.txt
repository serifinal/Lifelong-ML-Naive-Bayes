how would you frame this wall ? .
i have been lurking here for a couple of years and i am finally ready to start on my dedicated theater room in my unfinished basement .
my raw space measures about 23 ' by 18 ' 2 '' with 9 ' -lrb- concrete -rrb- floor to joist height .
one of the walls is a concrete half-wall -lrb- about 26 '' high -rrb- with conventional 2x4 framing atop that half-wall .
i would appreciate some feedback from the group on how you would frame this wall -lrb- it will be one of the side walls of the theater -rrb- .
the framing is set back about 4 '' from the inside edge of the half-wall .
i will be applying for a building permit so framing must be to code .
i am not that concerned with losing a little room width -lrb- up to a foot -rrb- as i plan two rows of four seats and i think 16 ' - 17 ' will accomodate that arrangement .
any help will be greatly appreciated .
