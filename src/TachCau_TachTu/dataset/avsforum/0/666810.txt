hooking my blu-ray player to my network .
what is the best way to hook up my blu-ray player to my network ?
i have a wireless network set up on the ground floor of my house , but my home theatre is in my basement .
i see a lot of people using the powerline ethernet adapters through their electrical outlets .
can i use a usb wireless adapter in my player ?
i ask all of this because i want to use the netflix streaming option through the samsung 2550 .
any help is appreciated .
