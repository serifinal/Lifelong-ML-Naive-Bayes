the official 9g pioneer warranty claim thread .
ok , we have heard it before , and i want to set the record straight .
there have been alot of inquiries regarding whether pioneer will honor their warranty to purchasers of their kuro displays .
in particular , there has been speculation as to whether they will honor an elite product if it has been purchased from a " non authorised elite dealer " .
my position is simple .
your warranty is with the manufacturer and not the seller .
the law provides no exceptions to designated " authorized dealers " .
if you purchase a new pioneer display they have no choice but to honor the warranty in the country it was sold , however , there are limitations .
canada remains a mystery , both for cost and warranty support .
this is plausible because they can not supply support over a region 1.87 million miles .
in the us , you have statutory and case law to secure your claim .
if the product is new and not resold you have warranty rights , express and implied .
edit : the warranty specifically points out that the original buyer or subsequent purchaser has all of the warranty rights .
i have never seen a post where pioneer has denied a claim based on whether it was sold by a authorized dealer or not , so i believe this thread will not produce a valid claim .
bottom line : pioneer makes the best plasma out there and it involves alot of tech that is not perfect .
buy your display where you believe there is secure customer support .
if you have a unresolved claim post it here , but you have to post the correspondence .
we will not accept a claim based on lip service .
i will attempt to work through these claims as a last resort from your seller .
