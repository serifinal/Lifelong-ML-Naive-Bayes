mits hc1500 , tosh hd-a2 , and sd dvds .
well , after almost a year i 'm getting my small church 's projector system put together .
i 've got the screen put together and hung and will be tinkering with the pj and dvd player tonight .
i 've still got some fine-tuning to do in regards to the environment ... got ta get some curtains made to cover the windows and the screen .
i 'm planning on using a solid -lrb- non-split -rrb- curtain in front of the screen .
the inner surface of the curtain will be black velvet .
when we ready the room for a movie we will swing the curtain up and out and attach the corners to some hooks in the ceiling .
this way the black side of the curtain will cover the white ceiling in front of the screen and hopefully help with ambient light generation by the screen/pj .
the primary equipment will be a mits hc1500 and a toshiba hd-a2 dvd player .
my question is whether to let the toshiba player upconvert the sd dvds that we will predominately be watching or to let the pj do all of the upconversions .
i 've see where folks recommend against doing conversion twice .
is there a definite answer for this question or do i just need to experiment and see what works best ?
any feedback is appreciated but i 'd definitely be interested in anybody 's settings that might have this same setup !
it 's good sd dvd performance that i 'm looking for .
thanks for your help !
