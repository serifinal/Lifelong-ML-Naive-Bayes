my cih theater : 148 '' / curved screen / acoustically transparent .
my turn -lrb- finally -rrb- .
the thread title is a bit misleading , because the masking 's not motorized just yet , but as soon as i stick in the add-a-motor it should be good to go .
did n't know if i could update the thread title later .
otherwise , here 's the details with pics ... the room before we moved in : first things first - my mostly diy rack .
i used ma rack rails and shelves , but mounted the rails directly to the wall studs and cut/painted mdf for blanks .
here it is before blanks have been added , with the hinged , velcroed door open : the blank filler panels i created during the painting stage : ... and the finished look : in the next post i 'll move on to the fun stuff - the projector and screen wall ...
