arcsoft tmt -- no downsampling and bitstreaming ! .
i submitted the following question to arcsoft : quote : i recently upgraded my video card to an ati 4850 , which supports the transmission of lossless pcm audio .
will tmt be able to either bitstream hd audio formats like dts - hd and dolby truehd or output them as lossless pcm ?
i understand that tmt currently downsamples all audio to 44khz / 16 bit .
is this true ?
today , i received the following reply : quote : we are sorry for the delay in replying you .
regarding your question , we will provide a user - selectable option " enable audio mixer " in the next release ( in setup - > audio ) , to control this feature .
tmt will be able to bitstream hd audio formats like dts - hd and dolby truehd if you uncheck the " enable audio mixer " option .
currently tmt downsamples hd audio stream to 48khz - 96khz if you check the " enable down sample rate ( 192khz ) " option ( in setup - > audio ) , and the audio card does n't support the hd audio stream .
we hope this helps answer your question .
thank you .
regards , arcsoft support i read this to mean that tmt does not currently downsample unless you request it and / or your card does not support it .
also , the fact that bitstreaming hd audio formats will be supported in the next release is , in my opinion , excellent news and the fact that it will be supported on my ati 4850 is even better .
thank you to arcsoft !
