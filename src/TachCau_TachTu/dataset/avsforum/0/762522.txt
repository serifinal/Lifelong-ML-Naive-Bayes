the midnight jungle theater debut ( dcp design , diy build ) .
after more than the usual pain and suffering , i 'm relieved to finally be able to present my finished theater ( definitely not a " standard " avs theater ) .
( stitch of 3 pics ) : room dimensions : ( 16 ' w ) x ( 17 ' l ) x ( 12 ' h ) screen : 108 " smx material , diy aluminum / wood frame ( 16:9 ) eyes to screen distance : 10 ' uncommon features : ceiling hanging " bass trap " panels with can lights , no drywall penetration !
area rug permanently installed as carpet ( already had it , saved on material cost ) i wanted my theater to be close to a " padded batcave " theater which normally means 100 % black everything and full acoustic treatments .
but i wanted some color , and already had burgundy berkline 090 seats , so i used some dark red fabric for accent .
the end result is dark enough that it 's extremely difficult to photograph .
the photos below used 1000w halogen lights , and / or a high powered flash .
under normal light , the different black fabrics are the same shade and you ca n't see through the grill cloth fabric .
fabrics used : gom fr701 - 2100 408 - black ( screenwall + soffits + ceiling panels ) gom zirconia - 3583 012 - garnet ( wall accents + columns ) dazian celtic cloth - black ( walls ) parts express grill cloth - black ( front main + column surround speakers ) started the design process with design cinema privee ( dcp ) oct. 2005 , received final drawings feb. 2006 ( yes , 16 weeks ) .
started demo and construction .
made quick progress for a few months , finishing framing , drywall , hvac , soffits , etc. .
in aug. 2006 , finished the 2x10 stage frame .
when moving it into position , it slipped out of my grip and dropped onto my big toe , shattering the bone .
3 months to recover plus several more months before interested in seriously working on theater again .
lesson learned : never do any heavy work without wearing steel - toe shoes .
finally reached carpet install feb. 2008 !
typical story : installed equipment , chairs , etc. and began using it .
last 2 % not finished until june 2008 .
60 + construction photos below show the long journey .
