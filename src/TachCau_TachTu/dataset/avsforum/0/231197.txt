two subs as alternative to bass traps ? .
i would love to put acoustic panels all over my family room for my home theater .
unfortunately , the waf is very low for this idea .
i could get away with corner traps in the bottom front corners , but the rest has crown molding and i ca n't cover that .
there are also no locations to place wall traps .
so , i can get away with a second sub ( one in each front corner facing inward ) .
i know it wo n't cancel reflections like the traps would , but it should still help with the fr in the room and help with standing waves , right ?
this is all theoretical right now as my first sub is on order so i do n't know what the room will sound like with just one .
the room is 5000cf with a 10 ' x10 ' port on the side opening up to another 10k - cf. the main room has thick carpet up front , with some heavy furniture in the middle does n't have too many parallel surfaces side - to - side .
the back wall is all kitchen and cabinets that should break things up .
