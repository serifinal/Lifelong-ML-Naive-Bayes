so what 's up with the stage , anyway ? .
ok , prepare your eyeballs for the ultimate stupid question !
drum roll please ............. .
what is the purpose of a stage , other than decorative ?
i 'm trying to figure out why i would want one in my 15x22 ht .
i can see it would be nice to place some floor standing front speakers on , but other than that , what does it get me ?
and while we 're on it , same question re : false wall for screen .
why would i need space behind my screen , other than for speakers ?
hooray for beginners !
thanks gang .
