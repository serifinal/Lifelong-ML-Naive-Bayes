lcd + strange dark vertical line issue .
hello , my mother `s samsung lcd ( 32 `` , about 3 yr old ) , show some maybe 3 - 4 dark vertical line ( about an inch thick , it actually look like some shadow ) , they do not show all the time , and mostly show on gray ( i.e a gray brackground ) .
the line do not show at all on full bright white screen , or complete black .
the effect is similar to moire , but not round a all , it `s just a couple of vertical darker line on some picture .
i am wondering if it could be related to the backlight . .
, those line show up on all sources .
please let me know if this problem has a name , and maybe a way to fix it ?
thanks
