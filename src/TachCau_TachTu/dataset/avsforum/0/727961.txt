in ceiling speakers stopped working ? .
all , i purchased a home in july that was wired for sound .
the speakers in the br stopped working recently .
i have played with the connections to the receiver and everything seems to be working properly there .
is there a way to test whether the signal is reaching my speakers to determine if the problem is my speaker or the wire ?
thanks .
