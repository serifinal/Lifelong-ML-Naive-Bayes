lg 42lg50 power on issues .
i have a 42 " lg 42lg50 that i just purchased used .
when i first turn the power on the light flashes then changes from red to green , as is normal , but sometimes the screen itself will stay dark .
i have let it sit for quite a while and nothing will happen .
if i let it sit for about a minute then turn it off and back on the tv screen lights up normally and works just fine with no problems after that .
it only does this when the tv is cold and has n't been used for hours .
sometimes after a 10 hour shift i will come home and it will work just fine .
i ca n't seem to figure out any kind of regularity or consistency to it .
is this normal for the tv to act like this when cold .
i could understand that it might need a warm up period but it does n't seem like a normal operation to have to turn it on , then off , then back on .
am i possibly doing something wrong , and if so what would be the proper way to turn it on .
if anyone has any experience with these symptoms or knows the cause and remedy for this , your advice would be greatly appreciated .
thanks in advance .
