.
i 'm in the process of finishing my basement and setting up a home theater in the future rec room .
the room is 23x14 with a 9 foot ceiling .
i plan on running a front projector on one of the 14 foot walls with a 120 - 144 inch screen with seating set back the full 23 foot length of the room .
i 'm not an audiophile - most of this is new to me .
the more i read the more indecisive i get .
i thought i had settled on the onkyo sr800 but the hdmi not processing the audio seems to be a big deal to a lot of people .
i 'm so new that i do n't know if this will annoy me or not .
i 'd like the collective advice from this forum on finding or building a system for under $ 800 that is expandable and that i wo n't regret buying from the start .
thoughts on the onkyo ht - sp908 or 907 ?
the system can be either 5.1 or 7.1 .
i plan on using the system for watching dvd 's and playing wii .
i want to make sure whatever system i get is powerful enough for the room size .
thanks in advance for your help .
