downgrade hd-a30 from firmware 4.0 to 1.3 / 2.0 ? .
i just updated my a30 to 4.0 and now it wo n't play any hd dvds .
it starts to stutter and then freezes up .
looking to roll it back to either 1.3 or 2.0 .
is there a modified firmware out there for that ?
and if not , how do i edit the firmware for the a30 -lrb- using a hex editor -rrb- to roll back the firmware ?
what settings need to be changed ?
thanks mark santora
