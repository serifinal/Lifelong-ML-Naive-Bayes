.
i 'm trying to figure out the differences between these three models in terms of picture quality and video processing performance .
i know the 7 series model has some superfluous features like internet connectivity , but does it have a better picture than the 5 or 6 series models ?
the compare feature on the samsung website is n't helpful ( ca n't remember when , if ever , it was ) so they all appear alike .
i know the 7 series is brand new , but models from the same product year typically share the same parts .
what differences have you found ?
if any calibrators have worked with these sets , please chime in since you 'll likely have gained some in - depth knowledge .
thanks , guys .
