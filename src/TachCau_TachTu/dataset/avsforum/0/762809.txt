xbox 360 hdmi cable with optical output .
i bought an elite and i have a problem with the optical out .
i ca n't fit my component cord and my hdmi cord in at the same time .
i was wondering if i could use the cord that came with it that is thinner than my component cord then plug in my hdmi at the same time .
will this mess up my xbox .
i think the cord that i am talking about is this cord ... http://www.xbox.com/en-us/hardware/x...60hdmiavcable/ does this cable come with the elite ?
also which cable do i plug in first , the hdmi cable or the audio cable .
could this possible mess up my video coming out of my hdmi cable ... like a green or red hue ?
thanks for the help ...
