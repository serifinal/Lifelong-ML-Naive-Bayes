in83 vs marantz vp - 15s1 and sharp xv - z20000 .
hi .
i am wondering how the infocus in83 compares to the marantz vp - 15s1 and sharp xv - z20000 , and even the marantz vp - 11s2 .
i know the 11s2 has a faster color wheel than the other three , but other than that , i 'm curious to know why the sharp and marantz projectors are priced higher than the in83 .
projectorreview 's review of the in83 said the color accuracy was great , as was the sharpness , and shadow detail .
art said the only thing about the in83 that was n't amazing was that the blacks were only exceptional .
so if that 's true , what else is there ?
what do the sharp xv - z20000 and the marantz vp - 11s2 do better ?
and how does the in83 's video processing compare to the custom video processing of the marantz ' projectors , and to that of the sharp xv - z20000 ?
thank you
