very disappointed and frustrated with my laminate screen project .
i spent all weekend last weekend building my diy laminate screen .
i went through all the trouble of special ordering the dw laminate , building a frame , cutting out pegboard , meticulously cutting the screen , etc. .
then i glued the laminate onto the pegboard using two entire caulking gun canisters of liquid nails .
it looked absolutely beautiful ... for about 5 days .
then all of a sudden i noticed vertical lines starting to appear on the screen yesterday .
it turns out that the laminate is now protruding in between each line of glue creating a sort of wave effect .
so now each line of glue is clearly visible as a dark shaded line on bright scenes .
i 'm not sure what caused this ?
the warmer weather ?
the glue hardening and " pulling " the laminate in some fasion ?
it was completely flat and very vibrant and beautiful for almost a whole week ... why did it take so long to appear ?
i put a ton of pressure on the screen when i glued it to flatten out the glue , but i guess that does n't make a difference .
so very discouraging ... what are my options now ?
i 'm sure i ca n't just peel it off and glue it again , the old glue would be next to impossible to get off evenly and there would probably be bumps where the old glue was .
it appears i 'll have to do it all over again with a whole new piece of laminate and substrate .
man , i 'm such an idiot .
any advice on what i should do to fix this ?
thanks .
