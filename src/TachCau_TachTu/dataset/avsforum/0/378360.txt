about to start construction - need input - new build thread :-rrb- .
ok so i 've posted a little about my proposed ht in the past but now it 's looking like reality with demolition to start within the next month or so -lrb- i hope -rrb- .
in any case .
the room is 23 ' x 11 ' x 6 ' 8 '' -lrb- yeah -rrb- .
i would like to put in 2 rows of seating and make the screen as big as comfortably possible .
i have a few concerns .
1 - 11 ' is n't that much to stick a 3 seat berkeline and still have room to walk around it .
2 - a riser for a second row would have to be tiny so people do n't hit their heads on the ceiling but i still want it to be tall enough so they can view the screen comfortably - suggestions ??
3 - again , due to ceiling height -lrb- and also due to a sewer pipe rinning in the back of the room -rrb- , i plan on mounting all equipment/pj behind the rear row .
sacrificing about 2 ' of length from the room .
4 - there 's a bunch of hvac stuff running just outside the room - i do plan on making the room as quiet as possible -lrb- rsic clips , green glue , double sheetrock , solid door -rrb- but am stil concerned - especially with vents / registers - can any of you point me to a good source of registers/vents/workarounds to quiet these down ?
do any of you see any potential issues/problems with equipment being right behind your head ?
-lrb- noise , heat , remote sensitivity , length of speaker runs to the fronts -rrb- thank you all - will update this thread as more news happens and as layouts / pictures surface .
thanks again !
