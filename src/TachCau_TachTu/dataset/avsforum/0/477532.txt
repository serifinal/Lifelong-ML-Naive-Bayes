pioneer 400 v vs. new 410v differences ? .
what are the new differences between the current pioneer 400v and the new pioneer 410v which is due in june ' 08 .
i only plan to run regular dvds and not use the many " d + + + " etc. , etc. formats than the players could run .
just your plain vanilla dvd player with the biggest bang for the buck .
so , in my situation tell me what the new 410v will do that the 400v currently does n't .
