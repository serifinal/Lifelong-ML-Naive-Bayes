fixing overscan on lg 32lc7d .
my set seems to have a bit of overscan , more noticeable on some channels ( hd cable ) than others .
noticed during the election , that some of the outermost numbers shown on nbc - hd were cut off , and i 've noticed text that is close to the edges of the screen may be truncated , although most everything else looks okay and not too obvious .
i know how to get in the service menu , but did n't see anything that looked like an adjustment for overscan .
is that even adjustable on this set ?
i can live with it , but i 'm a geek and like to get the best from my " toys . "
many thanks .
