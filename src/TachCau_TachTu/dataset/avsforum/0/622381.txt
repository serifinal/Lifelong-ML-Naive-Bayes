need motivation ?
get " loganed " .
ok all you slowpokes ... .
ca n't get that last 10 % that takes 90 % of the time to complete ?
hung your projector too soon ?
wife wo n't let you paint the ceiling black so now you ca n't decide which color to paint it ?
still stuck on the blu - ray or hd question ?
whatever your excuse , i can motivate you ( ok , and maybe me at the same time ) .
i 'm 2.5 + years into my build .
i 've got hvac and plumbing rough inspections .
i 'm this close to an electric rough inspection ( been that way for about 3 months now ) .
i 've put down dricore and i have one wall to attach rsic clips and then fire block and i should be good for a close - in inspection .
britinva wants to know when i 'll start a proper thread .
when i make enough progress to actually show something .
maybe this is it .
i got a little motivated last weekend and accomplished a few pesky things .
bigmouthindc says that if i finish before him , he 'll " never live it down . "
yeah ?
i 'm calling him out .
he 's been loganed !
i 'd logan britinva , too , just on general principle , but he 's already so far done it just would n't be fair .
when i beat him , the humiliation would just be too great for any man to bear .
bigmouthindc .... if you were going any slower stuff would have to start coming off your walls .
and now carboranadum wants to lay odds on big .
odds ?
i 'll give you odds .
i 'll give you odds i can fire up my compressor , oil my nailer and shoot myself in the foot faster than carboranadum can pick up a hammer .
you think i 'm kidding ?
huh , do ya ?
anyone else want a piece of me ?
huh , punk ?
yeah , you .
i 'm talking to you !
you want motivation ?
i got your motivation , right here .
i 've attached a couple of pics .
i 'll take and post a few more .
keep in mind , these are as of 1/2006 .
anyone else want to get loganed ?
come on .
i double dog dare ya !

hey !
if there 's one thing i learned after 20 years in it , it 's never do it twice if you can do it once .
two .
two things .
never do it yourself if you can get someone else to do it for you .
i 'm not maintaining that list .
it would take time from my build .
