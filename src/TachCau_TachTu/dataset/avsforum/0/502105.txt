dvd &#8594; pc &#8594; ps3 streaming ? .
ok - this is a repost as my old one got destroyed in the db failure .
turd , i was meaning to post a reply to you to say that i appreciated all the work you did , but by the time i was reading your posts , the threads were rather stale and you had moved on .
anyway - my problem : i would like to stream my dvd collection from my pc to my ps3 .
i can rip the dvd to hdd using tools such as dvd shrink etc , then cleanse the vob files with vob2mpg - this works well and the video will stream to the ps3 , but then i come unstuck because ff , rewind and pause do not work .
what i would like to do , is stream the ripped dvd programs with the following constraints , using the ps3 : > keep the picture quality intact > keep 5.1 audio if it is present > have the ff , rewind and pause commands work on the ps3 .
currently i am using fuppes to stream audio files to my denon avp - a1hd processor and this works really well .
in short , i am after a work - flow and software suggestions to get my dvd collection into a file container and codec that the ps3 will accept . .
m2ts has been suggested in the old thread , but what software and settings do i use ?
would something like popcorn hour a-110 be better than the ps3 ?
am i asking the impossible ?
many thanks in advance ( and thanks to all who posted in my old thread too ) .
