pemko auto door seals .
does anyone have experience / info on the pemko auto door seals ?
i am interested in the 4301 for a bottom seal for the ht door .
it seems comparable to the zero international seal , but for much less $ .
they both are about 1 inch thick with very similar mechanics .
pemko zero international my specific question is on the seal itself on the pemko .
they have a sponge neoprene or " pemkoprene " options .
i 've searched all over pemko 's website to see if they have any info sound barrier differences , but ca n't find anything .
my guess would be the sponge may be better since it is all on form vs rubber / air pocket .
they do claim the pemkopren makes a better seal on uneven surfaces ( mine will be on tile ) , so that may offset the density issue .
thoughts ?
thanks , much
