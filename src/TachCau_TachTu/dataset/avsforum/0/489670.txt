without pap , audio from every aacs - encrypted content will be downsampled to 16 bit , 48 khz .
surely the cards will not support dolby truehd / dts - hd master audio bitstreams .

??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? the ati proprietary dvi - hdmi adapter enabling hdmi audio in a radeon hd 4xxx card is a bit confusing .
first you have to use the ati proprietary dvi - hdmi adapter ( unless your card has a native hdmi connector ) .
otherwise you wo n't get audio through hdmi .
the adapter is sometimes bundled with the card .
if your card does not come with the adapter , you have to buy it , for example , from here .
download and install " ati hdmi audio device " driver you will need to install not only ati radeon video card driver , but also ati hdmi audio device driver .
- if you are a windows xp user , then download the ati hdmi audio driver from the amd website .
- if you are a windows vista / 7 user , then download the ati hdmi audio driver from the realtek website .
( why realtek ?
a reasonable guess is that ati lacks proper audio technology and ati relies on realtek for the whole audio part of the gpu . )
configure the sound dialog box after you installed the driver , you have to enable the ati hdmi audio device in the sound dialog box .
here are some screenshots of the dialog box .
first you have to select the correct playback device : realtek hdmi output .
( the motherboard was ga - e7aum - ds2h geforce 9400 mgpu , so you can see " nvidia hdmi output " too [ disabled because an nvidia gpu ca n't work simultaneously with an ati card under vista ] . )
click the " configure " button and open " speaker setup " .
then select the correct speaker setting .
click the " properties " button and click the " supported formats " tab , where you can select supported formats .
click the test button and select all the supported formats .
in the " advanced " tab , select the sample rate and bit depth .
vista audio engine will downsample / upsample audio to that sample rate / bit depth .
so you should choose the highest rate / depth here .
configure powerdvd / totalmedia theater powerdvd 8 ultra dd / dts pass - through : - speaker environment > use hdmi - output mode > ac3 / dts pass - through multichannel pcm ( including the one decoded from hd audio codecs / dd / dts ) : - speaker environment > use hdmi - output mode > pcm output or - speaker environment > 6 speaker ( or 8 speaker ) - output mode > no effect ( or whatever effect you like ) totalmedia theater dd / dts pass - through : - audio output mode > s / pdif multichannel pcm ( including the one decoded from hd audio codecs / dd / dts ) - audio output mode > 5.1 channels ( or 7.1 channels ) managing 5.1 channel sources with 7.1 channel speakers suppose that you use a 7.1 speaker system and select " 7.1 surround " in the sound dialog box .
this is fine as long as you play 7.1 audio sources .
howerver , when you play a 5.1 audio source , there will be no side or rear ( depending on your player ) surround sounds and you ca n't upconvert 5.1 to 7.1 using , for example , dolby pro logic iix , in your receiver ( as the receiver gets mute signals for the side or rear surround speakers ) .
a workaround is switch between " 7.1 surround " and " 5.1 surround " according to the numbe of channels in the audio source and then upconvert 5.1 to 7.1 in your receiver for a 5.1 source .
this can be done by hotkeys .
another easier workaround is use dolby pro logic iix built in powerdvd ( the picture below ) and use custom matrix in the mixer tab of ffdshow audio decoder for directshow players .
if you set mixer as is , the source frontl , center , frontr , backl , backr , lfe ( subwoofer ) is mapped into the speaker frontl , center , frontr , backl , backr , lfe ( subwoofer ) respectively .
speakerfrontlcenterfrontrsidelsiderbacklbackrlfe sourcefrontlcenterfrontr -- backlbackrlfe targetfrontlcenterfrontr -- backlbackrlfe you can use " custom matrix " so that sidel speaker is a mixture of sidel and backl , and sider speaker is a mixture of sider and backr .
for a 5.1 source , you will hear backl from both of the sidel speaker and the backl speaker .
for a 7.1 source , you will hear sidel + backl from the sidel speaker ( you will need to compromise ) .

this is achieved when the audio renderer selects the wasapi ( windows audio session api ) exclusive mode ( as opposed to the shared mode ) .
basic flow of audio streams is shared mode : audio source - > decoder - > ds renderer - > wasapi - > audio engine - > audio driver - > hdmiexclusive mode : audio source - > decoder - > reclock - > wasapi - > audio driver - > hdmiunfortunately there are only a couple of players / renderers that support the wasapi exclusive mode , and for movie playback , reclock ( since 1.8.3.7 ) is the only solution right now .
please read wasapi support for details of reclock wasapi support .
here are tables summarizing supported audio formats in the wasapi exclusive mode with reclock and foobar2000 + wasapi output plug - in .
i tested with various stereo / 5.1 / 7.1 channel , 16/24 bit , 44.1 / 48/96/192 khz , flac and wav files .
hdmi audio driver is r2 .18 .

___________________________________________ current solutions for multichannel lpcm hdmi audio ??????????????????????????????????????????? so we have plenty of choices for multichannel lpcm over hdmi : igp - intel g965 , g33 and g35 with sdvo hdmi device ( since 2006 ) - intel g45 - geforce 8200 & 8300 , nforce 750a & 780a sli mgpu for amd - geforce 9300 & 9400 mgpu for intel discrete graphics card - ati radeon hd 4350 / 4550/4600 series / 4800 series all the above solutions lack pap ( and software ) hence , audio from premium contents is downsampled to 16bit / 48khz .
none of them supports dolby truehd and dts - hd master audio bitstreaming .
sound card - asus xonar hdav1 .3 - auzentech auzen x-fi hometheater hd they are the only solutions that supports full - resolution lpcm and dolby truehd and dts - hd master audio bitstreaming .
_______________________ protected audio path ( pap ) ??????????????????????? audio from premium contents downsampled to 16bit / 48khz without pap !
the support for multichannel lpcm is only half of the story , however .
protected audio path ( pap ) is essential for full resolution audio , without which audio from every aacs - encrypted content will be downsampled to 16bit / 48khz .
pap is also necessary for dolby truehd / dts - hs master audio bitstreams .
quote : a licensed player shall not pass , or direct to be passed decrypted aacs content to a digital output except : 1.4.1 a digital output of audio , or of the audio portion of other forms of decrypted aacs content , in compressed audio format ( such as ac3 ) or in linear pcm format in which the transmitted information is sampled at no more than 48 khz and no more than 16 bits .
1.4.2 an output delineated in table d1 , aacs authorized digital outputs , in accordance with any associated restrictions and obligations specified therein ; another reason for downsampling : player bug non-premium contents need not be downsampled , but as a matter of fact are downsampled to 16 - bit / 48khz by powerdvd .
this a bug cyberlink acknowledged ( bit - tech - powerdvd audio downsampling explained ( by richard swinburne ; october 8 , 2007 ) ) .
quote : when asked why powerdvd downsamples hd audio from both blu - ray and hd dvd discs to 48khz / 16 - bit , chen responded by saying that " digital output without protection is not possible due to aacs requirement .
digital and analogue output with protection ( hdmi ) is also not possible due to lack of an internal secure audio path in a windows pc . " "
we are currently working with realtek to support their proprietary interface for encryption of audio bus .
once completed , we will not longer need to downsample the audio .
this will be provided for free to end - user for upgrade . "
this did n't really clear up the downsampling situation though because , as far as we 're aware all audio , regardless of encryption , is downsampled .
we therefore pressed chen to clear up the speculation . "
i think this is a mistake , " he said , " we never intended to pass this message .
i think there might be some bug in our program that downsamples everything .
that is not our intent .
we only need to down - sample premium content ( aacs , cprm , etc ) . "
this prompted us to ask whether there is a requirement for aacs in a pc when a disc or file is not encrypted .
chen told us that the unencrypted scenario is not mandated by aacs so should n't be included in the downsampling .
we inquired further about the " secure internal audio path " : is this because of microsoft not providing one and / or sound card companies not providing a compatible driver ?
chen informed us that there is n't an industry standard ( defined by microsoft or someone else ) that makes the encryption / decryption path between software and audio driver secure .
cyberlink have to enable one chip after another which takes a considerable amount of time working with sound card providers , microsoft and checking that it satisfies the aacs mandate .
the above bug applies to not only 7.3 but also 8 ( bit - tech - cyberlink powerdvd 8 & media show 4 ( by richard swinburne ; march 24 , 2008 ) ) .
quote : the lossless audio support that we first covered a while back has been put back to the release of 8.5 at around the august - september time frame .
again , cyberlink was keen to stress that this will be a free update if you already own powerdvd 8 .
this delay can be significant issue for those wanting to use powerdvd 8 with blu - ray disks , but after discussing this with both dolby ( truehd ) and cyberlink , as well as various motherboard vendors ( gigabyte boards that use the realtek alc889a and features &#8220; content protection &#8221; ) and even amd ( in reference to its 780g and its audio limitation to s / pdif pass - through under hdmi ) during cebit , all we can conclude is that hdcp for full quality audio is just a complete mess .
btw " a free update " is questionable because there may not be " powerdvd 8.5 " : bit - tech - cyberlink to launch new truetheatre technologies ( by richard swinburne ; may 30 , 2008 ) .
quote : another thing worth noting though is that powerdvd 9 ( formerly 8.5 ) will be available in a q3 to q4 timeframe this year puma and pap if you are interested in pap , the following document will be helpful to understand the current situation .
- output content protection and windows vista ( april 27 , 2005 ) quote : 4 protected user mode audio : puma 4.3 puma ( protected user mode audio ) security architecture this section examines the components in the puma engine concerned with security .
aside from the virtual audio server ( vas ) receiving component , the puma architecture includes three protection - related component types of interest : virtual protected output ( vpo ) module protected output controller ( poc ) output encryption audio processing object ( apo ) 4.3.2 output encryption apo the output encryption apo is the module that will provide encryption of the audio data , if it becomes necessary in the future .
for the initial release of windows vista , it is planned that just the interfaces to the module will exist , rather than any actual modules .
the planned implementation is that the audio system will request an output encryption apo from the poc .
the audio policy will set up the audio engine such that the output encryption apo will be called as the last processing element for the audio data , before the data is passed to the driver .
this allows the output encryption apo to encrypt the data according to the current protection policy .
the poc will choose to not load an output encryption apo if encryption is not necessary ( which it isn &#8217; t in 2006 ) .
4.7 pcie bus and puma in the same way as with video , the pcie bus could become a problem for premium audio , because content owners might regard it as a user - accessible bus .
the issue affects the use of a discrete audio card or a discrete graphics card that has audio capabilities .
while there might not be many discrete audio cards in 2006 , there more than likely will be hdmi discrete graphics cards that have hd audio controllers .
the important scenario is the play back of hd - dvds and blu - ray dvds .
in this case , the video is considered premium and the audio may also be .
there is no problem with the video , because pvp - uab ( protected video path - user accessible bus ) protects the video over the pcie bus , but there is currently no equivalent protection available in the audio world .
the pcie bus may be defined in some content industry agreements as a user accessible bus .
it is further defined in some content industry agreements that premium audio is not allowed to pass over a user - accessible bus in unprotected form .
in spite of pc industry push - back on this requirement , it is not certain which way the decision will fall .
realistically , any concession in this area would only be valid for a small number of years , so the pc industry needs to address this issue in the not - too - distant future .
microsoft plans to address this as part of the pap ( protected audio path ) project that will be a number of years after the initial release of windows vista .
when the pc industry does pap , there will be a way of encrypting audio over the pcie bus .
for discrete graphics manufacturers , the easiest mechanism to use would be pvp , because their graphics chip hardware will already be able to decrypt this .
the encryption would be done in an output encryption apo module in the audio engine in the protected environment .
as mentioned earlier , the plan is to provide a mechanism in windows vista to load a future output encryption apo module .
even in the initial version of windows vista , however , a third party could write a custom output encryption apo module that performs pvp encryption .
this would need to establish a separate session key , because there is no robust way of getting the session key from the graphics stack to the audio stack .
we hope to be successful with the amendment to the content industry agreements , so that using an encrypting output encryption apo module can be deferred for a few years .
in summary , microsoft 's pap in vista was left unfinished and this is likely to be the origin of the current chaotic situation of downsampled audio .
hardware and software player must work together pap involves encryption / decryption process and requires the support by both hardware and software player , just like pvp ( protected video path ) .
quote : 5 protected audio path : pap possible pap architecture think about pap is as a collection bucket where we store future ideas about audio content protection .
current thinking is that pap would provide protection all the way to the codec chip that has the digital - to - analog converter that makes the sounds ( * my comment : replace it by hdmi transmitter ) .
this might include protecting over whatever physical and wireless cables are in use in that future timeframe .
the most likely encryption candidate would be aes 128 - bit counter mode , just like pvp .
instead of the protecteddxva component doing the encryption , the encryption would be done in an output encryption apo in puma .
in both the audio and video cases , the important thing is that the encryption is done inside the protected environment .
the proposed plan is that the hardware aes engine that does the decryption would be in the codec chip .
this is a harder than in the case of a graphics chip , because codecs have far fewer gates and are also more price sensitive .
the desire to not over burden codec chips is a contributing factor in not pushing to introduce audio encryption quickly .
adding aes engines to codec chips would at best take many years , and might turn out not to be feasible .
( * for discrete graphics manufacturers , the easiest mechanism to use would be pvp , because their graphics chip hardware will already be able to decrypt this . )
establishing a session key is the hardest problem .
it is not practical for an audio codec chip to do diffie hellman , because there is no natural math capability as there is in the case of graphics chip programmable shaders .
providing robust hardware authentication is a big part of what pap is about .
as in the case of pvp , hfs ( * hardware functionality scan ) can be used for hardware authentication .
a codec chip is not as complex as a graphics chip , but even so there is enough sophistication that can be used in the hfs process .
for pap , the authentication would likely be done using a codec - specific user - mode authentication module that would plug into the poc component in the puma engine .
even though the user - mode module would be specific to a particular hardware manufacturer , the microsoft class driver can still be used .
that still leaves the problem of how to establish a session key .
tentative plans address how to extend the hfs process to also generate a key at both ends of the wire .
for want of a better name , this process is called mkey .
the session key established between the output encryption apo and the audio codec chip would be used to encrypt a content key generated by the output encryption apo .
it is the content key that the output encryption apo would use to encrypt the content .
as stated , the requirement to encrypt audio data is still many years away , and there is certainly no specification for how to do this yet .
having said that , microsoft is eager to work with manufacturers of codec chips to plan for the future .
puma ( protected user mode audio ) architecture possible pap architecture here is a slide created by realtek .
this is basically a simplified version of the microsoft slide above .
protected video path ( pvp ) btw pap architecture is similar to pvp ( protected video path ) architecture .
pvp - opm ( output protection management ) architecture pvp - uab ( user accessible bus ) architecture ______________________________________ hdmi sound cards &#8211; proprietary pap solutions ?????????????????????????????????????? since microsoft is not going to finish the unfinished project pap , several software and hardware manufacturers are developing its own protected audio path and a sound device supporting it .
right now the following two solutions are available ( soon ) .
auzentech x-fi hometheater hd and cyberlink powerdvd - tweaktown - cyberlink interview for the htpc hd fans ( april 10 , 2008 ) cyberlink said there are two reasons why they need a proprietary interface : uncompressed audio data would be interfered by vista os ( mixing with other audio streams , down mix and so on ) , which would cause incorrect results while decrypting protected data in audio hw / driver ) .
microsoft has not defined a new interface to pass new compressed audio formats supported in hdmi 1.3 ( dolby truehd , dts - hd ma , dd + ) .
the basic flow of audio ( lpcm , dd + , dolby truehd , dts - hd ma ) is : powerdvd --- > proprietary api ( no winmm / media foundation / directx / vista audio engine ) --- > audio driver --- > audio device ( analog or hdmi ) powerdvd encrypts data and send it to the audio driver / device via a proprietary api .
the audio device decrypts and analog : renders and output it .
hdmi : mux with video and output it via a hdmi transmitter / hdcp .
the product is expected in q1 2009 .
asus xonar hdav1 .3 and arcsoft totalmedia theater the following is an early report on this solution .
- computex 2008 - asus hdav 1.3 update quote : asus , with assistance from c - media and arcsoft , has been able to adhere to the paps and aacs content schemes without having to downmix the audio sources ( resulting in 16 - bit / 48khz dvd quality audio ) or even dropping support for dts - hd and dolby truehd altogether .
i will leave the details to the official thread : * official * asus xonar hdav1 .3 thread _____________________________________________________ mkv and flac &#8211; a solution for full - resolution audio without pap ????????????????????????????????????????????????????? you can remove aacs encryption by anydvd hd and create your own mkv files with full - resolution lossless audio track ( flac ) with eac3to and then play them in full quality with any of the multichannel lpcm solutions .
