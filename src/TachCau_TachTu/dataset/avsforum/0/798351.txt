help - analog and digital audio out simultaneously with onkyo tx - sr504 .
i hope someone can help me .
i just bought an open - box onkyo tx - sr504 , and i love it , except for one big problem .
my girlfriend owns a gaming sound chair , which she sometimes uses when i watch dvds .
i have everything hooked up , but no matter what i try , i ca n't get the onkyo to output dolby digital surround , which is connected through the dvd player 's digital coaxial , and also output 2 - channel analog , which is connected through the dvd player 's analog cables , at the same time .
if i select the default dvd mode on the receiver , it automatically selects the digital coaxial input ( dts / dd ) , and i ca n't get it to also send out analog at the same time , even though my dvd player 's analog audio cables are connected to the analog inputs on the receiver .
i know the dvd player is outputting both signals , because if i bypass the receiver , and hook the dvd player 's analog out directly to the chair , the chair works , while also getting dolby digital through my receiver .
that would work , except i have other things connected to the receiver that i want to get through the chair , and everything else is getting passed through to the chair except my dvds .
is the receiver not letting me output both analog and digital simultaneously , or am i missing something .
any help or advice would be great .
i imagine their other receivers act in a similiar fashion .
