trying to limit moving pieces .
i have a vista media center running with the dvd library enabled playing discs ripped in video_ts format .
playback works , it 's decent , but not awesome .
i 'd like to continue using the built-in functionality like dvd library rather than installing additional plugins and services like my movies -lrb- though i realize there are some benefits to them -rrb- .
i 'm really trying to keep it simple - fewer `` moving pieces '' for me is better .
launching external programs with a bunch of add-ins and things that are n't terribly well integrated with media center ... too many moving pieces .
my question : are there improvements i can make to the built-in dvd library playback ?
for example , i see some folks like to install different codecs like purevideo .
does that make all the difference ?
i 've gathered that ffdshow can do some nice things for by adding post-processing , but from my research it does n't look like you can get it running during dvd playback .
-lrb- maybe i 'm wrong ? -rrb-
registry tweaks or configuration settings i 'm unaware of ?
