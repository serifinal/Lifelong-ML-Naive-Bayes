not a good report .
circuit city online has gotten the new panasonic players in a bit earlier than expected and the first orders are shipping today .
those that opted for " express " shipping ( like me ) will begin receiving players on tuesday the 14th .
it is time for a new owners thread .
i have owned the previous panasonic bd30 , as well as numerous other models .
i currently have the lg bh200 and ps3 in my system for comparison and i 'll be posting my comments on the new panasonic bd35 .
