panasonic ax200u or optoma hd65 ? .
i found some older threads on this but no real conclusions in a couple of areas that i 'm worried about .
i have an hd65 currently -lrb- with a few days left to decide on return -rrb- , see : http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=14661766#post14661766 the areas i 'm trying to nail down are the following : - lens zoom/shift : i am not sure i `` m going to perma-mount this , and may be using it in different situations or rooms .
i 'm not 100 % sure , but let 's say i want the flexibility .
i 'm not sure it 's a deal killer , as you can always stack/angle/lift in a temporary situation if you need to .
`` honey , why do we have to move the couch back ? ''
-lrb- in this regard , it seems like the ax200u is the clear winner . -rrb-
- color `` vibrancy '' : this may be sacrilegious , but i love the almost-not-real colors produced by my samsung dlp rptv .
the optoma seems to have this kind of trend , but not sure the ax200 would .
said another way , do the lcd 's have the same type of `` pop '' in color that a dlp would ... -lrb- no known winner here ... hd65 by default ? -rrb-
- brightness : well , the ax200 is numerically ahead here , with 400 extra lumens rating .
not sure how much this plays out in real life .
people say the 65 is bright -lrb- already a light cannon at 1600 -rrb- , i do n't have a lot to compare to .
i do have ambient light in many rooms , none will likely be completely bl acked out .
-lrb- numerical winner with ax200 -rrb- - sharpness and shadow detail : i 'm a pixel peeper , having played with video compression for many years .
i like my 720p to look 720p - -rrb- i 've read a common thread that people think the ax200u is a bit soft , and i 've seen peter _ 's shots from the hd65 that seem to indicate it has amazing sharpness capabilities .
-lrb- winner hd65 by default , having not seen 200u in person ? -rrb-
- gaming : i may well game on the projector at some point , but not sure .
the hd65 looked just fine when hooked to my macbook , so i assume it would be ok for gaming .
lag adjustments are baked into the latest games anyway -lrb- like rock band -rrb- .
- portability : the optoma is like 1/4 the size , so it wins here .
i do n't mean to travel with it on planes or anything though , so not sure this should be a huge deciding factor .
- noise : the optoma is loud , have n't heard the ax200u but varying reviews say `` whisper quiet '' to `` loud '' .
so , hopefully someone has some real world experience to help me attack some of these questions .
i called a few avs vendors -lrb- and avs themselves -rrb- and the answers trended toward the ax200u in each case .
the only -lsb- potentially -rsb- negatives i heard are `` lcd and dlp have a ` different ' picture , that comes down to personal preference '' .
since i ca n't see one locally , i 'm hoping to help understand the differences via my question above .
i 'm also forum-spelunking trying to find user pictures from the ax200u to compare to peter _ 's excellent hd65 pictures .
thanks in advance for any help .
i hope i can take comfort in the fact that hopefully people on here have as much ocd and pre/post buyer 's remorse that you take sympathy on my `` plight '' thanks !!
