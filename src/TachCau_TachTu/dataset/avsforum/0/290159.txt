sub - bic h 100 -lrb- $ 250 -rrb- or hsu vtf-1 -lrb- $ 400 -rrb- 3 .
polk r15s , csi25 or r150 and csi25 -lrb- is there anything better ? -rrb-
4 .
receiver - onkyo 606 or 874 -lrb- ~ $ 500 , whichever is cheaper -rrb- it is little bit out of my range but i may buy 1 , 2 and 3 items right now and buy the receiver early next year .
