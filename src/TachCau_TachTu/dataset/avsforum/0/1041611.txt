much needed help !!!
toshiba 42rv530u or lg 42lb5d .
okay heres my story guys try to help me please !!!
im a noob just know the basics about hdtv 's ... i first purchased the samsung 40 `` lcd ln40a450 on the 6th ... this set only did 720p ... got it home and the sound was horrible ... couldnt stand it ... so i figured what the hell ... i have a ps3 getting into the whole blu-ray thing . .
ill take it back and get the cheapest 1080p with the best picture ... that turned out to be the toshiba 42tv530u for 1199 .
i got it home i was amazed .
great picture right out of the box ... popped in my blu rays ... its was good ... not amazing but good ... .
well anyways all this happened on the 6th of the month ... sunday i noticed the lg 42lb5d , that does 1080p was on sale at circuit city for just 999 down from 1600 .
everyone ive asked has said go with lg its a better brand then toshiba ... plus it would be 200 cheaper too ... and lately watching my toshiba blu rays the blacks have looked kind of `` grainy '' if that makes any sense .
however every review i look up of my toshiba tv is a great one !!!
im so confused ... what should i do ?
should i just keep the toshiba or return it and hope they will refund my money -lrb- this will be the 3rd tv i returned to best buy this month -rrb- then get the lg at circuit city ?
someone help me out !!!
thanks guys
