framing false wall & firestopping .
i have a wall in my basement in which i have plumbing ( water & sewer pipes ) than run about 8 " off of the concrete wall .
i want to frame a wall in front of these , which will make the wall approx. 12 " offset forward of the basement concrete wall .
my question is how do i create firestopping ( 10 ' ceilings ) in that false wall , when it is 12 " offset ?
how do i do this ?
any ideas out there ?
