verizon rep claims that their set top box is necessary ... .
does anyone know if this is true ?
i 'd really like to build an htpc , but i do n't need an additional computer if it ca n't double as a pvr ... what do i need to tell verizon ?
the rep was adamant that without one of their boxes , there 's no way i could watch tv ( from both a technical and non-technical standpoint ) .
thanks !!!
