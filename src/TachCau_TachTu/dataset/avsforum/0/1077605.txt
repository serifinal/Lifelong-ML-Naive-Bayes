calling for a comparison review between the sony 550 and the panasonic 55 .
i believe we need a professional head - to - head review of the street released sony bdp - s550 and the already professionally reviewed panasonic dmp - bd 55 .
these two players have the same msrp $ 399 , 7.1 analog outs , are supposed to decode all audio codec , and are 2.0 players .
we need to know : build quality power up times disk load times quality of dacs for analog outs blu - ray playback quality color quality std dvd playback quality usb functions ( sony ) vs. sd functions ( panasonic ) add others you think should be covered in the h -2-h !
there are plenty of great reviews of the panasonic , but how does the sony stack up against it ?
