the dungeon -- > beginnings of a new build .
ok , i finally found someone to start studding up my basement while i am away and figured i better start finalizing a few things .
here are a couple of rough design pics for what i want to do for my ht and some general info on the numbers i am coming up with .
please pick it apart and tell me what i am doing wrong so i can make changes now .
general room size : 14 ?
6 ?
x 18 ?
from ib wall to rear wall : 14 ?
6 ?
false wall to rear wall : 16 ?
6 ?
ceiling height : 102 ?
soffit height : 90 ?
ib : ib space : 235 cu ft speakers : 8 ?
dpl-15 amp : face 1200 eq : fbq2496 screen : 120 ?
2.35 first row : 120 ?
second row : 180 ?
pj : du n no , prob rs2 or newer model lens : aussie mkiii when they ship speakers : 7.1 lcr : klipsch 10.5 surround : klipsch 3.1 rear : klipsch 3.1 pre/pro : looking at the marantz 8003 set i will be powering my av closet via a belkin pureav pf60 .
i will also have fo stars in the top ceiling area , rope lighting around the soffit edge , can lights in the soffit and controlled by a graphik eye .
my av closet will be controlled by a touchpad a friend is setting up using rf or wireless on a linux system .
i will also have a 12tb raid in the closet for the movies that are not being played off the ps3 .
i know the screen is too big for some people but the way i see it , i can mask it down if it is too big for me .
i would rather it be too big then not big enough .
thanks for your pre-help .
chad
