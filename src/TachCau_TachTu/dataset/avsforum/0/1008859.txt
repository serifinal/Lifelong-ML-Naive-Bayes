please help me decide : pioneer kuro pdp - 5020fd or samsung ln52a650 ? .
after spending weeks researching flat screens i have narrowed it down to the kuro 5020 and the sammy ln52a650 and for the life of me i ca n't decide .
i will be mounting it to the wall in my bedroom which has draped windows along the left wall ( blocks out a significant amount of the light ) .
viewing distance will be 6 - 8 ft with viewing angles of 0 - 30 degrees .
lights always off ( viewing mostly during the day ) .
no game play .
will be viewing sports , blue ray , but mostly hdtv .
from what i 've read motion , picture and sound quality is better on the kuro , but its not as bright .
the kuro also seems to have a small problem with inaccurate primary colors which can not be adjusted due to the lack of advanced controls ( according to cnet ) .
the sammy does n't seem to have this problem .
i would also be giving up 2 inches of viewable space .
also , the kuro will cost me $ 347 more .
both seem to get stellar reviews but so far i 've been unable to find anyone comparing the two .
i 've never owned a plasma and currently have a toshiba regza 27 " lcd in the bedroom ( way too small ) and a marantz vps4 dlp front projector in the home theater room .
horizontal panning bothers me on the dlp while jerkiness bothers me on the toshiba while watching anything with fast motion .
i guess picture and motion quality are the most important aspects for me and i would be willing to pay the extra $ 347 if its worth it .
giving up 2 " on the kuro is also bugging me .
is there anything i 'm not considering regarding these 2 units ?
please help me decide .
thanks , doug
