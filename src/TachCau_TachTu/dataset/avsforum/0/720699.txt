amazon price a steal ? .
hi all - i was literally within days of pulling the trigger on the samsung fp - t5084 when this new model , the pn50a550 showed up - and at nearly the exact same price point .
i see that the contrast ratio is double ( 30,000:1 ) but aside from that i do n't know much else about it .
i know there is a pn50a550 owners thread but there has n't been any direct comparison between these two models .
which should i go for ?
thanks !
