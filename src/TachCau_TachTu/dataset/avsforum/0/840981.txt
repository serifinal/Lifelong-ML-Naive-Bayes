pending : jvc rs20 projector i have been reading the 2.35:1 cih threads and screen threads ?
especially the high gain thread as well as the rs20 screen thread .
i also was looking at the dalite `` jkp affinity '' hd progressive and enhanced matte white screen thread , but that doesn?t sound like what i need .
i think a higher gain screen might be helpful .
screens i have thought of : - dalite `` jkp affinity '' hd progressive and enhanced matte white screen -lrb- gain 0.9 ? -rrb-
- sounds like it wo n't work - da-lite high power -lrb- hp -rrb- -lrb- gain 2.8 -rrb- + / - pro image horizontal masker -lrb- http://www.dalite.com/dalitehomethea...?product_id=15 -rrb- - other avs quote `` i have mine on ceiling , even tought i wont have the full 2.8 gain , and i do n't need it .
what sold me to it is screen texture .
the hp have virtually no screen texture .
i tried a lot of screen sample on my wall the the hp is the only one that would n't drive me crazy '' `` the narrow viewing cone issue even seems to be over-stated .
i think most will be pleased .
my image seems bright and vivid to the point that i 've been asked several times if there is big `` tv '' built in behind the screen .
no one has ever mentioned a perceived change in the image as they move around or sat or stood . ''
rec eye level mount -lrb- vs ceiling -rrb- - but ok with ceiling too -lrb- bw supposedly better for ceiling -rrb- - stewart studiotek -lrb- gain 1.3 -rrb- , others ?
- carada brilliant white -lrb- bw -rrb- -lrb- gain 1.4 -rrb- - avs quote `` if you 're ceiling mounted , i 'd 100 % get the carada bw . ''
- vutec silver screen what about -lrb- horizontal -rrb- masking systems for these screens ?
likely to add on later ?
please feel free to comment .
i realize ?
huge ?
and ?
bright ?
/ detailed/etc are somewhat competing features to optimize .
my jvc rs20 should arrive on friday and be installed next wed , so i should be able to play around with it some -lrb- on the wall -rrb- to get an idea of screen sizes , brightness , etc. .
thanks .
mike
