help !
my sony bravia has green interference on right side of screen . .
below is a picture of my 2 - year old sony bravia kdl - 40s2000 .
it has always had a great picture until recently when a green column began to appear .
it 's always on the right side though it will often fade in and out .
this picture shows the interference at its worst .
the unaffected portion of the screen still looks great .
i see it regardless of source - hd , sd , dvd , xbox .
my provider is at&t u-verse .
i 've already tried a hard reboot - the green column reappeared during set - up .
i chatted on - line with sony support and they were no help - he kept thinking it was a tint / hue problem .
there 's a sony certified repair shop about 45 minutes away .
i 'm hoping someone here can give me an idea what 's wrong before i haul it all the over there .
please help !
