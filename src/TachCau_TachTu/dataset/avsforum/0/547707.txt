need help with ripping software for bluray video and losslesss audio for first htpc .
i just pulled the trigger on my first htpc : http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/...52921665296592 except i got the 20e/b model for half the price -lrb- same as above but with only half the memory , 2 gb , and no cablecard support -rrb- .
i do n't plan to use this as a dvr -lrb- but if there is some way to do this on conjunction with a directv hd sat box that would change my mind -rrb- ... yep , i know i overpaid and that someone could have built something better for half the price but i do n't have the time to build a htpc from scratch and i really like the style of the sony vgx-tp20e / b. please let me know if i am really missing something with this so i can refuse delivery if need be ... i plan to rip bluray and sd dvd to my home media server storage and i am looking for the best quality bluray disk ripper and the best quality sd dvd ripper .
hd loseless audio on bluray is very important to me .
any suggestions ?
also what is the best format/s to store these files as for optimal quality and useability ?
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated - thanks !
