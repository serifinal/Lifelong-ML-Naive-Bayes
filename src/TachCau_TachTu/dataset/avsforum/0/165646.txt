hd stb calibration - hdmi and component outputs .
i had my hdtv professionally calibrated a year ago ... the calibration was done thru the " normal " menus on the tv ( not the service menus ) ... video input 7 was calibrated -- it was the connection from my pace hd dc - 550 cable box 's hdmi to the tv 's hdmi ... i have since purchased a hauppauge hd - pvr that connects to the cable box and tv via component inputs ... i set the component input up with the same calibration " specs " as the professionally calibrated hdmi tv input ... it " looks " good to me ... very similar -- but you ca n't do a side - by - side ... so here 's my question ... i have to assume the right way to do the new component input 's setting is thru another calibration ... but i do n't want to do that now ... i 'm just wondering how the cable boxes firmware / etc does the conversion of the signal differently between the component and hdmi inputs ... i 'm not sure if the answer is hugely technical or not ... any help / insight would be appreciated ... thx ...
