the " z " family theater .
current progress : finally some change !
i still have a lot of ' touch up ' to do , but we 've already moved some stuff down .
after moving one couch down , i 'm thinking the new ( still unused ) couch i bought a year or so ago for the theater will not fit down the stairs ( tight corner ) .
looks like i 'll have to sell and get some " theater seats " like w00lly !
the front room that 's still movie friendly .
__________________________________________________ after talking to the finace about wanting my own " home theater " , she 's finally given me the " okay " , however , there is a catch ... the spare space in the basement will be a play room for my daughter ( it 'll look more adult - like though , i hope ) .
anyway , today the framing started down in the basement .
i was originally going to do it myself , however , i got a couple quotes on what it would cost just for someone else to do the framing ( i 'm doing most of the rest ) .
the first quote came back at just over $ 3,100 for just for the job and material ( wood ) .
knowing that seemed high , i waited for the second quote to come back .
the second one was $ 675 for everything ( metal studs ) or $ 9xx for wood .
i was looking to go with metal studs for several reasons , so i chose that .
after looking at the cost of materials , some of the tools i do n't have and paying my soon - to - be brother in - law to help out a little and most of all , my time , i figured i would n't have saved any money if i did it myself .
today the crew came in and worked 4 hours and got most of the work done .
they are due back this weekend to finish up the rest .
i 'm not aiming to have a theater that looks like you 're actually at a nice theater .
i am really aiming for something like landshark 's sweet setup i just want a decicated room that still makes me feel like i 'm at home .
a clean look with no wires showing is what i like most .
i also did n't want all the annoying lights from equipment to bug me while i 'm watching a movie ( not to mention the noise of an xbox360 ) , so everything will be in a separate closet ( with an ir extender ) .
this is the plan anyway ... i am very open to any other idea 's , thoughts , suggestions as i ca n't think of everything .
if you have any constructive input , please share !
i am going to go with a 100 " screen ( not sure which one yet ) and an epson 1080ub .
here is a quick sketch i did late one night with google sketch up .
for the most part , the deminsions are correct , but the shape is a little off and i have n't added in the closet ( i have it , but it 's on another computer .
at this point , i was just trying to visualize what i can do with what i have to work with ( maing room will be about 11 ' 6 " x 24 ' ) .
i 'll run wire to where the sub box ( pictured ) is sitting and another one up front so i have options for sub placement .
here 's the work they did today .
i plan to do almost everything after the framing is done .
screen area back of theater where the " comm " closet will be .
the " play room " for my daughter ... in a few years .
back of the play room and storage area .
nothing much right now , but should be fun to play some cod4 soon !
