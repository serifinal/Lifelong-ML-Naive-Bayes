home theater in my living room ........ plans so far . .
hey all .
i have been lurking the forums for a couple weeks doing research .
there is a lot of good info on these boards .
i have been remodeling my entire house for the past couple of years , and it is about time i do something with the living room .
i am pretty space limited in the rest of the house so this room will have to do .
here are my plans so far : it 's going to be a tight squeeze , but i think it will work out well when it is done .
the toughest part of the remodel here is going to be the entertainment center .
my house is old , and the space where the entertainment center is going is now occupied by a brick fireplace facade that i am going to rip out .
then , i 'm going to attempt to build the entertainment center myself to somewhat match the existing woodwork in the house .
the room is approximately 12 ' x 24 ' .
i was originally looking at the pioneer pdp5080hd for my display , but after looking at this layout , it may be too big considering the seating position will be about 8 feet at the most .
i may end up going with a panasonic th42pz700u instead .
for a receiver i am looking at the onkyo tx - sr705 .
for front speakers , i am looking at polk r150 's , center channel a polk csr .
i have n't decided on wether to go with a 5.1 or 7.1 setup yet , but i am thinking either another pair of r150 's for the side surrounds , or if space looks to be getting to tight - i may try and sink some polk rc55i into the walls instead .
if i do go 7.1 , i was thinking of the same rc55i 's for the rear surrounds .
i am still up in the air on a subwoofer , but i have read good things about the h - 100 sub .
so what do you guys think ?
i have been looking for plans or directions or any kind of help in designing and building the entertainment center ........ any suggestions ?
comments ?
thanks alot .
