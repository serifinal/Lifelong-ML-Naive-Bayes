anyone know what this is , a crack in the lense , in the bulb ... something else ? .
here 's a picture of the problem : [ img ] [ / img ] i received my benq 8720 a few days ago after having it in for service .
after watching a few movies , i noticed a dark blue - ish line on the left of the screen .
i 've cleaned the lense and looked closely for a crack , but i could n't see anything .
the bulb has over 2500 hours on it , so it 's no problem for me to replace it , but how do i find out what causes this ?
any help is much appreciated .
i managed to link to my image .
i hope imageshack is okay .
btw , i cleaned the lense before this anamoly appeared .
i used a wet tissue meant for lcd screens and then finished off with a dry lense cleaning sheet .
i 'm afraid this is the cause of the problem .
