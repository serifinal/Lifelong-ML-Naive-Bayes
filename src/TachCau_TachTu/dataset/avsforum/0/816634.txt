white `` artifacts '' -lrb- noise -rrb- pioneer elite 9g .
i have searched everywhere for topics on this and cant find anything .
any help is appreciated .
i just purchased a pioneer 9g kuro elite 60 '' , ran the break in for about 20 hours that the picture is stunning !
however , when i run my ps3 at 1080p i receive a white `` artifacts '' -lrb- looks like white noise -rrb- i do get a picture but it looks like white random snow all over .
i am using a denon receiver that runs at 1080p rapid run hdmi cables 25 ' when i plug in the ps3 directly to the monitor it works perfectly .
when i plug in the ps3 directly via the 25 ' cable the noise appears .
when i plug in the ps3 through the denon same noise appears .
have tried the active cables from rapid run and more noise appears .
does this sound like a cable issue or is it a pioneer issue ?
