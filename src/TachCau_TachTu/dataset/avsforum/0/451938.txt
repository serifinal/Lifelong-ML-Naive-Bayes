panasonic sa - bx500 small light powerful .
looks like i am going to have to start the thread on this product .
no frills , no osd , no multi-eq , allegedly great sound from the class d amps .
the big question are those digital amps as good or better than in the sa - xr55 in this 11 lb .
midget ?
could they break the " ice " ?
sorry , had to give one under the belt what got me right away is that its depth is only 12 " unlike the sa - xr700 which expands backwards to keep slim .
my sony xbr910 only allows max 13 " depth on the a / v shelf , no other hd receiver of the current crop can fit in there .
relatively light , yet it did well in some reviews , as you would expect from a basic hd decoding receiver , biamping / biwiring included .

i have been using an sa - xr70 for 3 years now in the kids room .
this replaces it , i have nothing but high expectations .
will post impressions .
