netflix quality @ 6 mbps vs 3 mbps ? .
i bought us a samsung bd - p2500 for christmas and plugged it in last night using an ethernet cable direct to the dsl router and hdmi cable to the 768p plasma in the bedroom .
we have a 3mbit connection right now , and had all but the last two little bars on the sd ( poseidon adventure ) and hd ( 30 rock ) source we watched last night .
the poseidon adventure was a little soft compared to dvd but did n't have much in the way of motion artifacts ; the still parts of 30 rock were sharper than dvd although backgrounds got soft and had some macro blocking .
both beat satellite and were watchable .
how much better would things be if i upgraded our dsl connection to 6mbs ?
