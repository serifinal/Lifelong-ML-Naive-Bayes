.
i am seting up an onkyo 606 and i 'm debating whether to utilize the hdmi connections on the receiver .
i am currently directly attaching all of my components ( directtv and hd dvd ) using the hdmi connections to my tv ( pioneer 6020 ) .
i 'm then using the digital optical audio from the tv to the onkyo .
the sales person suggested keeping this setup as it would provide the best picture ( even through the onkyo has a pass through feature ) .
my question - was the sales person correct or should i utilize the onkyo pass through to run my hdmi connections throught the receiver ?
i feel like i 'm just missing out on something with the onkyo by not using the hdmi connections .
thanks in advance .
