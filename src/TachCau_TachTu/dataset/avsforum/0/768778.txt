the 2 row 1080p bedroom conversion ht build - finished for now ... .
guess it 's time for me to use this site to document my progress .
i have been in the project/ht stuff since the introduction of the infocus 4805 .
back then , it was just the couch , projector , a pulldown screen and some window blinds .
all this time , i have always -lrb- like everyone else -rrb- wanted a dedicated room for ht built .
guess thanks to the weak housing market , it has finally come true .
this year , we brought our 2nd home .
throughout the looking process , each home we looked at had to have that requirement .
so , in february , we brought the house .
on the 2nd floor , we have a spare room that measure 11.75 x 16 with one windows toward the back side .
so with the wife approval , we have our ht room .
