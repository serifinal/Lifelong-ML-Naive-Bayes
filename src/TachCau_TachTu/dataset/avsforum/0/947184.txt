samsung lnxxa450 calibration / settings thread .
since i could n't find any posts of a similar nature , i decided to start by posting my settings here .
i 'm not exactly an hdtv guru , but i have some settings that look fine for me .
note : these settings are calibrated on an xbox 360 .
mode : standard backlight : 7 contrast : 87 brightness : 63 * sharpness : 0 color : 50 tint : no change detailed settings black adjust : off dynamic contrast : off / low ( note : this is up to you ) gamma : -1 color space : native white balance : i did n't change anything flesh tone : 0 edge enhancement : off picture options color tone : normal ( no " warm " settings in standard ) size : just scan digital nr : off hdmi black level : low ( on 360 , expanded * ) set up energy saving : off * : when the low / expanded settings are active , the blacks are , well , much blacker .
this is why brightness is so high .
the blacks are still black with no change from zero brightness at these settings .
also , question : does this tv initiate 3:2 pulldown ?
if so how ?
( i read you need to activate " film mode " . )
please , submit better calibrations if you have any .
thanks
