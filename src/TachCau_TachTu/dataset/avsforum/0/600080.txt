my hdtv only supports 1080i , worth it to get a terrestrial hdtv tuner ?
absolutely ! .
new to the forum but i do n't think this question has been asked .
my 52 '' mitsu only supports 480i , 480p , and 1080i .
i 've noticed that some of the local broadcast channels -lrb- las vegas -rrb- broadcast in 1080i , but some only broadcast in 720p ... like fox .
fox is the channel i care most about , am i out of luck ?
i would imagine a tuner that would receive the signal and convert to 1080i would work just fine on my tv , but does such a thing exist ?
any comments ?
btw i have a rooftop antenna currently only being used to receive analog stations , i 'm waiting for my $ 40 coupons to arrive before toying with dtv .
the tv does not have an atsc tuner .
