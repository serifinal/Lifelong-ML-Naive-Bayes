`` the dark knight '' pq issues . .
i just watched my copy .
regarding pq why is it they have to mess with the block busters .
i was disappointed to see someone applied good ole ee .
the ringing is not to bad but its enough to leave the movie with what i call edginess at times during long distance shots it clearly rears its head .
sad .
i had to make sure all sharpness setting were flat for this one but it did not help clean it up .
i screened this at 8 feet wide .
i doubt anyone with a smaller display or flat panel will notice as this transfer will come off extra on these sets .
other then this complaint i found the transfer/sound/movie enjoyable .
all follow ups please mention your display width .
thx .
