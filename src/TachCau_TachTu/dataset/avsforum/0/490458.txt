anyone have the new elvis : viva lv tribute br ? .
i just read about it but had no idea it was coming .
seems like it 's just performances of songs he made famous by diff performers but there looks to be some good stuff there .
i need a good review before i go near a walmart .
no that crazy about wm.com either !
