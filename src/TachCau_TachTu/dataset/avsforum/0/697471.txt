hdcp problem , arcsoft totalmedia theatre .
group : pardon me if this question has been asked already .
for the first time today , i tried to play a blu-ray disk on my computer .
i have a sony sxrd 60 '' tv with one of the hdmi inputs connected to a radeon -lrb- diamond -rrb- hd 3450 video card on the pc .
i 've got the full windows xp desktop coming out properly on my tv .
i launch the arcsoft -lrb- a demo version i downloaded yesterday from cnet and installed -rrb- media player .
no problem .
i put a br disk in the drive , after twenty seconds or so , the media player starts playing a short video clip and goes for 2-3 seconds .
then it stops .
the message : `` your system is not compatible with hdcp , bd playback is disabled '' comes up .
so i know the video card is hdcp-compatible .
there must be some enabling of this that i have n't done yet .
what do you who are observing this forum suggest i do to fix this ?
thanks in advance .
