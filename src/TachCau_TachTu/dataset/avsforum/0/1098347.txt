panasonic dmp - bd55 vs sony bdp - s550 comparison .
the time has come to help potential buyers decide on either the s550 or the bd55 .
i received my s550 last week and bought the bd55 today .
now here is the comparison for both units .
for the pq comparison i used my parents 65 " sharp aquos 1080p lcd .
build quality s550 - excellent for the price .
solid .
built in japan .
bd55 - not bad for the price .
very good .
built in china .
winner - s550 .
sound quality from hdmi output s550 - very good , bass from the hdmi output is a little weak .
bd55 - the sound quality from the hdmi output sounds fuller than the s550 's hdmi output .
i have to choice to use its internal decoders , or bitstream the sound to use my receiver 's decoders .
winner - bd55 .
bootup time i had to be fair on the bootup time .
i made sure that i disabled the quickstart mode on the s550 .
both players bootup around 20 seconds .
winner : tie .
loading time s550 - it just depends on the disc .
bd55 - a tad faster than the s550 .
winner - bd55 picture quality s550 - very good .
details are sharp , color is good , pq has a natural look to it .
bd55 - excellent .
details are sharper than the s550 , color is excellent and more vibrant than the s550 , pq has a somewhat glossy look to itm but also has a natural look to it .
winner - bd55 .
conclusion as panasonic continues their hertiage of producing excellent proforming blu - ray players , the bd55 is perhaps the best blu - ray player on the market for its price range and the best blu - ray player that panasonic has made so far .
sony again ca n't reach panasonic 's level of expertise of blu - ray players .
sony should learn from them .
below are the pros and cons of both players .
pros s550 excellent build quality .
excellent onscreen display ( video bitrate , video codec , audio codec , etc ) very good pq .
very good audio .
decent dvd upscaling .
quiet fan .
quiet bd drive .
good loading times .
bd55 very good build quality .
excellent pq .
good dvd upscaling .
excellent audio .
fast bd drive .
fast loading time .
quiet fan .
cons s550 no frame by frame option .
some people say that sony uses an inferior blu - ray processing chip this year instead of using the sigma chip which is consider better in pq .
bd55 does not have a detailed on - screen display as the s550 .
frame by frame controls do not work good .
update 1 : second comparison on post # 7 .
update 2 : added the tv that i used for the pq comparison .
