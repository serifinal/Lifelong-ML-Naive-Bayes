matching a center speaker to epi 100s .
so i am attempting to build up a home theater system using epi 100s i inherited from my dad as the mains .
and reading up i should try and match a center channel speaker to them .
specs courtesy of humanspeakers.com response : 45 to 18k hz rms power : 12 to 50 watts -lrb- very conservative rating -rrb- crossover : 1800 hz drivers : 8 '' woofer 1 '' air spring dome tweeter impedance : 4 ohms dc , 8 ohms nominal i just bought an onkyo 576 receiver -lrb- tx-sr576 , 80w to 8ohm speakers -rrb- .
i mainly want it for movies , the room is 12x15 with me sitting 12 feet away from the speaker , i 'm trying to stay below 6 '' to not have to wall mount it and ideally stay in the $ 100-200 range .
i 've been looking at a klipsch sc-5 -lrb- maybe splurging for a rc-10 -rrb- , or trying to get a boston acoustic micro 90c on ebay .
any suggestions or advice is welcome and appreciated .
thanks
