.
i recently purchased a 46 " sony v4100 which seems to have a dramtic case of the " sparkles " .
i bought the tv at cc , so i have 20 + more days before i have to return it .
i went to cc today to view their sets to see if the sparkle issue showed up there .
it was much less of a problem on the display sets and something that i could live with .
i guess i got a bad apple .
i can either return the v4100 for the same model or i can upgrade to a w4100 or possibly a toshiba xv540u .
unfortunately i have n't been able to see the toshiba locally and would need to order it online .
my questions are : what are the real gains by stepping up to the w4100 from the v4100 ?
is it enough to justify the cost difference .
i do n't want to have buyers remorse , so if the 120hz technology is better and will be useful in the future , i do n't mind paying a bit more .
more importantly , has anyone viewed the sony 4100 models next to the toshiba xv540u ?
has anyone owned both ?
what were your opinions based on pq and sound quality ?
are they as good as the sonys ?
i can get the xv540u cheaper than the w4100 and it has a 10 - bit panel ( supposedly samsung ) and is 120hz as well .
are toshibas reliable ?
i hate making a purhase site unseen .
for the record , i love the pq of the sony sets and do n't care for the gloss screens of the samsungs and their lackluster sound .
the clock is ticking on my return period .
any opinions would be appreciated .
