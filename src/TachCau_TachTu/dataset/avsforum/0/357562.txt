diy theater turns homeowner into installer .
diy theater turns homeowner into installer by krissy rushing jeremy hummer had so much fun turning his garage into a dedicated home theater , he decided to change careers .
the first films jeremy hummer saw as a child had a huge impact on what he wanted to do with his life .
he was obsessed with the idea that multiple images captured on a strip of film could reproduce moving images .
in the 1980s he began collecting 8 mm and 16 mm films and converted his bedroom into a theater , complete with actual film projectors , a screen , and a multi-speaker sound system .
but film isn?t a cheap or low - maintenance date .
the high cost of buying film prints and maintaining the delicate material caused jeremy to move to laserdisc and begin his massive video library , as well as purchase a video projector and a bona fide surround sound system .
when dvd came along , jeremy?s hobby got even more serious , only now he had a house in gulfport , florida , with a 500 - square - foot garage .
that?s when he started thinking about turning the place that once housed cars and yard tools into a true , dedicated theater . ?
remodeling the garage instead of using an existing room allowed me to design the entire project from the ground up and do it the right way architecturally , acoustically , and electrically , ?
says jeremy .
he hired subcontractors to do most of the construction labor , but handled the wiring and equipment installation himself , relying on a knowledge base acquired from a 10 - year - long career in broadcast - television system integration .
