an online retailer for phifer sheerweave that sells by the yard ! .
over in the dedicated theater design & construction sub forum user mohaimenk stumbled upon the following site which sells the phifer sheerweave for a great price by the yard .
i thought this should get a new thread over here in the diy section because a lot of people come here looking for info on sheerweave .
http://www.interiormall.com/cat/nsam...=113044&t=2182 i have never purchased from them , so i ca n't vouge ( vogue ?
how about vouch ! )
for them , but the price looks great .
i know when i was trying to buy my material last year it was a lot of work to find a local vendor to sell just the material , this was before seymour really took off and just after rueben stopped selling his smx material alone .
hopefully this site will work out for people looking to save some money going down the diy path .
