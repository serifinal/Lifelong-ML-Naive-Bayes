how would you finish this screen wall ? .
ok , please go gentle .
i know there are only about a billion screen - wall shots in this forum , and i know my options ... i 'm just still not sure of the whys and hows , so i need to just flat out ask : how would you finish this screen wall ?
i guess the two options that i 've seen are 1 ) just finish the drywall normally and paint it black , but i guess the consensus is even the blackest black paints do n't absorb light as well as fabric .
and 2 ) leave the drywall unfinished , cover it with linacoustic ( or an equivalent ) , and then stretch fabric over it and hang the screen .
that is where things get really fuzzy for me .
i do n't plan on doing a false front ( not enough room , even if i had the need ) , and i 'm not going at , so i 'm not sure why the linacoustic ?
general sound considerations , nice black padding behind a fabric cover ??
if i were to go a route like that , how do you fabric cover ; just pull a big piece of whatever around the frame and staple it behind the wall ?
i 'm tempted to lean toward the paint , because even a diy doofus like me can do that , but the " fabric " screen walls always look so " finished " and dark ; it 's one of the areas i do n't want to compromise , even in my v1 .0 .
if it matters , i 'm planning on a 96 " 2.35 screen , and the sides of the wall will be built out a bit to " recess " the screen and create like flanged columns on the sides .
thanks for the help guys , cd
