optimum throw distance .
i 'm considering a phased approach to cih , starting with zoom now and adding a lens later .
i 'd like to mount the projector just once if possible .
the room is 14 ' x 22 ' .
i 'm currently planning for a 1:2.35 screen width of 125 " ( about 10 ' ) , and i 'm strongly considering the panasonic ae - 2000 .
the screen would be a fixed screen on the front wall .
i can mount the projector on the 10 ' ceiling at any distance in the room out to about 21 ' .
before i started thinking cih , i planned to mount the projector at about 14 ' ( throw ratio of about 1.8 ) to optimize brightness .
now i 'm considering pushing that back to a throw ratio of 2.0 at about 16 ' to consider other apects of picture geometry through a lens .
questions : 1 .
will zooming to 2.35 ( before adding a lens ) also involve / require lens shift adjustments ?
2 .
how do i choose an optimum throw distance for my phased approach to cih ?
3 .
do i measure throw distance to the front of the lens or to the panel in the projector ( or something else ) ?
4 .
with the ae - 2000 at these distances ( 14 ' - 16 ' ) , what screen gain is optimum ?
thanks for your help .
