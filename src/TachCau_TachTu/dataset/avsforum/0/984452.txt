beginning stages - sunrise estates theater / basement finish .
first off , i want to thank the many users on this forum that i have learned things from while doing my ht construction research -lrb- in other words , i was leeching -rrb- lol i have been visiting this forum from time to time taking in bits and pieces here and there and am now ready to start my ht construction thread .
this build will probably be a long running one since i do n't always have a ton of extra time to work on it but when possible , i will get into the basement and always post updates and lots of pics .
my ht room is 26 ' 4 '' x 13 ' 3 '' x 8 ' ceilings -- very long room but i 'll make do my plan is 3 rows of seating , 2 sets of dipoles on the sides and 1 set of either dipoles or standard speakers in the rear .
below is a concept image of my plan .
the blue lines indicate the room being divided into 7 's for surround placement purposes -lrb- i read a thread on this forum that suggested doing that ... any thoughts ?? -rrb-
the concept image also shows 8 columns .
the double height risers will both be filled with sand and vented as bass traps .
is this overkill on the bass traps ?
here is a view of the ht area -lrb- sorry for the terrible picture quality - taken with iphone -rrb- here is a second shot ... added a simple 2x4 front wall to go up against the cement exterior wall .
the screen wall will be built about 2 ft in front of this .
also started playing with layout positioning -lrb- that 's what all the scrap wood is on the floor -rrb-
