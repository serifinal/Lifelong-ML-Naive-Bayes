penteo / sontrio will be at the san francisco aes .
hey guys , penteo is finally coming together as my full time job .
just this week i filed the paperwork for llc incorporation and got the space at the october audio engineering society show in san francisco .
i 'll be showing both penteo and sontrio , the 3 - point surround subset of penteo .
i 'm also working on pulling together an event for the saturday night at a well - known san francisco disco , to demonstrate 1970s and 80s classic dance music in 3 - point surround .
as always , thanks to all of you who have downloaded demos and given feedback .
