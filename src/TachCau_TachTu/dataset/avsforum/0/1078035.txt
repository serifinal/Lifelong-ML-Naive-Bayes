ripping dvd for ps3 -- with commentary ? .
i 'm currently doing the following steps to back up my dvd for playback on my ps3 : 1 ) use dvdfab to rip dvd to vob when i do this , i am ripping the main movie , and selecting multiple soundtracks ( including commentary ) .
2 ) use vob2mpg to join vobs into a single mpg .
3 ) copy this mpg to my ps3 .
this system works very well .
however , i would like to listen to the commentary tracks .
using the ps3 controller , it appears i only have one audio track to choose from .
i 'm guessing that it 's being lost somewhere ?
dvdfab says it 's ripping all tracks ... so perhaps the vob2mpg does n't pass them along or something ?
any ideas ?
thanks in advance !
