same prob here with 4870x2 , no joy . .
video content , including all video played through windows media player and youtube via internet explorer or firefox , yield horizontal scan lines during playback .
the lines appear for a fraction of a second during fast panning , action , or abrupt scene changes .
the problem is extremely noticeable when trying to watch a movie and is very distracting .
when viewing a video in a window , the scan lines are contained in the video frame and do not affect the rest of the screen .
i have tried many different screens including multiple monitors via dvi and a hdtv home theater projector via hdmi .
i can not take a screen shot of the problem , the screen shot displays perfectly .
instead i took the above photo with my digital camera , notice the line in the top half of the picture .
can this be fixed or is it a problem with my video card ?
i have gone through all the settings in catalyst control center including pulldown detection and anti-aliasing with no success .
the problem has been prevalent since the purchase of the card and has continued through multiple driver updates ( currently i am running catalyst version 8.8 ) .
the problem seems to be worst in flash videos , mkv , and xvid files .
i have tried ( 2 ) different codec packs with the same result with both .
here is some relevant information : os : windows vista ultimate x64 video card : msi radeon hd 3870 512 mb pci - e driver version : catalyst 8.8 memory : 4 gb processor : intel core 2 quad core q9300 @ 2.5 ghz video players used : windows media player 11 , media player classic , flash plugin for internet explorer 7 , firefox 2 , and firefox 3
