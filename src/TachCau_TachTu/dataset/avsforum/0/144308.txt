samsung pn50a550 turning ` pink ' in middle of screen .
i have my brand new , 2 month old , samsung pn50a550 plasma sitting here .
i have followed all the precautions , never setting it in dynamic or normal mode and running the break-in dvd on and off when not using the tv ... while keeping the settings very low during the break-in period and now , when the room is entirely dark , and i set it to `` all white '' i am seeing a distinct ` pink ' color in the middle of the screen .
it is not image retention because it has no set lines , it is just diffused very slight pink that goes white to the outsides .
it is not based on my settings because the rest of the screen is ` white ' -lrb- or close enough to white -rrb- while this thin but diffused area seems ` pink . '
i reset it to factory settings and i am still seeing a very diffused and hard to see , but very real , pink color .
i attached a picture explaining what i am speaking about is this something i should be paranoid about ?
i have a wonderful warranty from abt and they will come out if i call , but i do n't know that you could see it during the day .
