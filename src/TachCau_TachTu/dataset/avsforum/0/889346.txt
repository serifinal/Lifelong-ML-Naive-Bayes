sony xbr6 and similar w4100 wl140 etc hack ? .
i assume that sony ( as most other manuf . )
does not produce dozens of chip sets - but the model differences are done thru software only .
it could possibly mean that same family models can be hacked , by implanting software from the better model into the lesser model .
usually it is done by substituting headers in firmware update so the given hardware accepts the update .
of course if hardware is not there not all features will work .
any skilled fellows out there ?
it is not my baileywick .
