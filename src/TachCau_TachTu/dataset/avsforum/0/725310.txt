ok , i guess since a decent amount of us have these units now .
we can slowly try to find out which picture settings work the best .
i will start by posting d - nice 's break in settings as well as his post break in settings : break in picture : av selection : standard contrast : 50 brightness : -2 color : +15 tint : 0 sharpness : 0 pure cinema film mode : off text optimization : off screen size : full power save mode : off orbiter : mode 1 post break in pioneer 5020fd / 6020fd reference settings picture : av selection : movie contrast : 38 brightness : -1 color : -5 tint : 0 sharpness : -15 pure cinema film mode : advance text optimization : off power save mode : off orbiter : mode 1 ( all screen size modes except dot - by - dot ) mode 2 ( dot - by - dot screen size mode only ) i have used d - nice 's reference settings and i must say they are quite good .
i might have tweaked the color up 1 or 2 notches to my liking .
i was curious as to if anyone has played with the pure cinema modes to see how it affects the picture .
i have n't had time yet myself to give it a shot to see differences .
also , i was wondering if anyone has been using other modes besides movie to see what works best for them .
i also would love it if someone could post some good settings for regular cable viewing .
i do not have hd cable just regular analog so settings of that nature would help ( looking for mostly sports settings ) thanks in advance .
