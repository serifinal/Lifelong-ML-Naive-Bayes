september 2nd - playon beta .
today 's show : it was a hot topic in the inbox last week , and we promised to check it out .
so keeping to our word , we spent some quality time with the playon beta from mediamall technologies .
mediamall is all about allowing set top boxes to access internet video .
playon is the consumer software version of that technology .
in short , it 's really cool ; well worth installing if you have a windows computer and a ps3 , xbox 360 or hp mediasmart tv .
