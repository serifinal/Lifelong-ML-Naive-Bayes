onkyo tx - sr706 and tx - sr806 downgrades ? .
i was looking more carefully at the shots of the rear of the x05 and x06 models and noticed some things missing in the new models .
i collected all four in one shot below .
it appears the 705 was radically redesigned internally in the 706 .
almost everything is moved on the rear panel .
also the 706 and 806 rear panels are now identical except for the addition of a 5th hdmi port on the 806 .
both still have a jig port for upgrades presumably ( if the serial ca n't be used ) but there is only one on the 706 as opposed to two on 705 .
some things lost in this model include optical out , a component video input and a switched ac outlet .
the first two personally do n't bother me , however i would really miss the ac out since i use it to control my rack fan .
also if you look at the pictures of the 805 vs. 876 it looks like the 876 is the new 805 as far as rear panel .
the only difference on the rear panels between 805 and 876 is the additional in / out hdmi and moved am / fm antennas .
the 876 maintains the optical out and ac outlet .
also at this point i guess the only reason to go for 805 over 705 is increased power output and an additional hdmi port .
