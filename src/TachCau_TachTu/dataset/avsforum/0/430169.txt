samsung a550 vs pani pz85 .
so ive got a 42 " pz85u right now but i am wondering if i should take it back and switch it for the samsung a550 ... lcd btw .
i know this gets into the lcd vs plasma debate but im not here for that .
i know the plasma will have deeper blacks but the samsung has truer colour at least from what i have read .
i would rather have the truer colour .
the samsung is also 46 " vs the pani 's 42 " ( both the same price ) .
the samsung plasma in those sizes is more money here so im not looking at it .
i du n no what to do im pretty happy with the pani 's picture but 46 " would be nicer and if im gon na be gaming im a bit worried about ir in the plasma .
also the pani seems to have quite a list of possible problems .
thoughts ?
