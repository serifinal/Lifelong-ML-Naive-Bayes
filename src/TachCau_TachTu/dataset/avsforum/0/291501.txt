why do people spend as much ( or even more !! )
on an avr as they do on speakers ? .
i read threads constantly about people wanting to spend $ x on a certain avr only to find out they have possibly cheaper speakers buy an $ 1k avr but only have a total of $ 1k in speaker ??? i really think it should be stressed more how much important the speakers are then the avrs , no ?
