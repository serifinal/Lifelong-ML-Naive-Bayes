7 diy speaker build thread .
l / c / r : d.a. khanspire - an rs150 / 225 wmtmw http://htguide.com/forum/showthread.php4?t=26309 i was originally going to with the wwmt design that has been built plenty of times already , but the reason i chose the khanspires were most importantly the placement of the tweeter since the screen is at , placement plays a big issue since the speaker will now be elevated a few feet , i would n't want the tweeter to be 3 feet above ear level .
i was also thinking about building identical mtm 's and then just adding bass bins and bi-amp the speakers .
then k and cjd started work on the wmtmw and decided it was the right speaker for my situation .
i already bought all the stuff to start on the khanspires and just wait for it all to show up so i can start building .
surround speakers : the rs22528a - an rs225 based mt http://www.audioheuristics.org/proje...ence_rs225.htm i was going to go with the modula mt design but decided to go with these since they have a bit more output capability and power handling .
