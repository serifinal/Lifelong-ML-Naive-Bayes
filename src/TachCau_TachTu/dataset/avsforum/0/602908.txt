poll : " unconventional " sonotube finishing opinions .
so , this week i ' llne building my sonotube and though i 'm not against doing a sleek black carpet covering , i might like to do something a little different .
something that might be a good coversation piece as well as a monster sub .
i might still just play it safe and do the black carpet on glossy black mdf , but maybe someone will have a better idea .... .
another idea i forgot to add to the poll was the lifesaver ( like a lifesavers candy package ) also , if you think its all too strange , tell me to just do black and stop the madness ....
