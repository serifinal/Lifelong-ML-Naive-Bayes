diy 104 " 1.85 screen with integrated masking system for 2.35:1 .
hello .
i wanted to share with everyone on avs what i hope to be a very easy , cheap , and effective plan to make a diy screen with a manual ( remember cheap ) masking system to allow for 2.40 content .
since i am not using a special lens , this masking system will be for a constant width image .
hopefully within a year i will be building a new theater in a new home , so i didn?t want to spend much money on this new screen , but at the same time i wanted to keep the screen and the front wall appealing .
my goals : increase screen size from current 92 inch screen .
create a manual masking system that will allow user to set different aspect ratios .
keep cost of the screen and masking system under $ 150 .
masking system completely integrated into the screen frame .
i only have a few drawings of my plans , so i prolly wo n't most those .
but i hope to share plenty of photos .
basically the masking system will be a turn - by - hand system using pulleys inside the frame .
to lower the upper mask , i will turn the upper tube clock-wise to my desired position .
same idea for the bottom but turning counter clock-wise .
since the pulley systems are not attached , i will be able to completely cover the black bars on the top , while allowing for some of the bottom black bar on the bottom to be covered .
i thought i make not always use the lower masking system completely since on 2.40:1 content the time bar and some subtitles are shown in that area .
