sky + to mce .
hi , i currently have sky + with multi room giving me sky + in the lounge and normal sky in the bedroom .
i am moving house in december and am currently speccing out the new build house for audio/video and networking .
there will be 5 rooms in the new house with tvs in .
i 'm having most rooms cat5 'd . .
and i like the idea of putting a media extender or x-box with each and sharing recorded tv , live tv , movies and audio around the house .
my questions are : - can i capture a sky signal and share it / record it ?
- could i also capture and share digital free view as well if i had another tuner device ?
so i can have multiroom , by having sky on one tv and regular digital freeview on the other ?
how does one switch between the different live tv signals ?
- is it possible to recreate sky + features like recording 2 channels simultaeniously ?
- do i need an amp in each room if i want surround or is that data sent down the cat5 -lrb- or wireless -rrb- to the media extender and then to the tv and speakers from there ?
if so how ?
is it hdmi and then normal audio ?
- i 've seen some set ups with a single amp in a control room and speaker wire running to all rooms ... is that another way of doing it ?
sorry if these questions are noob .
just having a hard time getting my head round it all and really do n't want to lose my sky + facility as i 've grown to love it .
cheers trav
