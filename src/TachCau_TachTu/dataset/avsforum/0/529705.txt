how to calculate throw ratio ??? .
i am considering doing a 2:35 cih set - up but , am having trouble figuring out my throwing ratio on my jvc - rs1 .
the distance from the front of the lens to the screen is 147 " and the current screen is 92 " 16 x 9 ( 45 " x 80 " ) .
1 - do i divide the 147 " by 92 " to get my throwing ratio ??? i am trying to figure out what size of screen can i move up to .
i am thinking of 96 " or 104 " .
any suggestion will be greatly appreciated .
