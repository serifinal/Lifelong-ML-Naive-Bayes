jeffcs theater construction begins !
thanks to logan .
hello everyone .
the planning has got to come to and end or i will never get this project rolling .
my build is my first attempt but i will be adding all the common elements of most the builds here such as : 1 ) double drywall , green glue and integrity gasket 2 ) hvac 90 degree runs under mdf boxes 3 ) grafik eyes 4 ) 2 rows of seating ( 3 and 5 ) berks and movie seats 5 ) riser 6 ) sand filled stage 7 ) columns 8 ) screen wall with diy 120 ?
at scope screen ( sheerweave ) 9 ) full sound treatments - traps etc. .
( bpape design ) 10 ) starfield ceiling ( ~ 11x5 ) 11 ) dedicated equipment room with built in dvd storage 12 ) whatever else i may dream up or you all suggest * 12.1 ) lighted marquee and poster frames - indygreg inspired * 12.2 ) second grafik eye ( to date 9 zones ) * 12.3 ) bigs nip and tuft bar front * 12.4 ) snack area - just cause it is a one of a kind !
* 12.5 ) powered masking system * edited the room we just built our new house and i did accommodate for the ht but ??
being a bone head my dimensions are not the greatest ~ 18x16x 9 ( nothing i can do about this at this point &#61516; ) .
here is the back side of the room ??
could have easily made it a few feet deeper errrrrrrr with the at screen puts me very square as shown in the diagram .
note the light blue is and existing soffit and the peach are the planned new ones .
here are some pics of the space equipment room - big mess right now but will be moved to the room?s back false wall .
existing soffit ok fellas chime in if you see something i am setting myself up on and would really appreciate over all comments and suggestions .
and if you are lurking out there logan you are mine !
but do owe ya some thanks as you did get me motivated !
cheers jeff
