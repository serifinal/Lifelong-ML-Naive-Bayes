help with onkyo ht-r550 and ps3 setup .
i have a sharp 42d64u , an onkyo ht-r550 , ps3 and comcast cable box .
i 'm new to this stuff so i apologize if the questions sound off the wall .
my problem is i had a ps2 hooked up to my system and everything worked fine including the surround sound .
the comcast box was connected to the 550 by hdmi and the receiver was also connected to the tv hdmi .
the ps2 was connected with composite cables , -lrb- audio to the receiver and video to the tv -rrb- .
i bought a ps3 and my future son-in-law connected the ps3 to my receiver using hdmi .
the surround sound with the ps3 for both movies and games works just fine .
the problem is that the surround sound does not work when i watch tv like it did before the hdmi cable was hooked up .
is there a connection there ?
would it be better if i disconnected the hdmi from the ps3 and used component cables ?
is there something that i 'm not doing ??
is there a way to disconnect the tv 's internal speakers to allow just the use of the surround sound ?
has anyone else had this problem ?
thank you
