does the asus p5ql - cm support tv out directly through vga ? .
my htpc has let me down getting a signal from the htpc to my onkyo receiver , so my last resort is a vga - s - video cable ( not ideal , i know ! ) .
however , the cable im contemplating states " your vga card must support tv out directly through vga port function " .
but i do nt know my the motherboard i am using ( asus p5ql - cm ) support this .
does anyone know if it does , or how i tell ?
thanks
