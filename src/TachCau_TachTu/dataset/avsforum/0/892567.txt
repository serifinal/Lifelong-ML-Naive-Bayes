3 foot hdmi cables long enough ? .
hey i 'm trying to visualize the length of 3 foot cables and whether or not they will reach from pioneer fd - pro151 to ps3 and receiver . .
i have a stand / storage system that is almost identical to this : http://www.salamanderdesigns.com/syn..._img_quads.jpg is 3 feet enough to get from tv ( which will be on the stand ) to the ps3 / receiver which will be directly underneath ?
if the cables were straight it 's a no brainer but considering they have to be bent or whatnot i 'm not sure . .
hard to picture as i do not have the tv or stand yet ( they are on order ) i 'd just like as little cable slack / clutter as possible in my new setup . .
thanks . .
