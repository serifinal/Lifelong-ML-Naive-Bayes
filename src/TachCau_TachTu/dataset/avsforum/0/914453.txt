alright , you 've fooled around long enough ... go build something ! .
edit for ht intro screen shot on 2/26/10 on the advice of many on this forum , i &#8217; ve decided to start a thread to track my progress and document the experiences as i build a small home theater .
as a professed novice i haven &#8217; t mastered many of the skills required to &#8220; build &#8221; a really nice room , but i &#8217; m giving it my best effort .
which means i spend a lot of time just staring at the walls .
here is a sketchup drawing of what i plan to do : from the rear wall to the screen the ht room is about 18.5 &#8217; long .
it is 11 &#8217; wide for about 8 &#8217; from the screen wall and widens to 13.5 &#8217; at the seating area .
the ceiling is 8 feet .
i 'll place the equipment rack underneath the stairs and i &#8217; ll access it from behind the seating area .
the room is below the children &#8217; s bedrooms so sound isolation is my primary concern .
in fact , i plan to use as much of my current equipment as possible and use the majority of my budget for isolation and acoustics .
i plan to use dri-core for the subfloor and to stagger stud one wall -lrb- the rest are concrete , all will be dd+gg -rrb- and decouple the ceiling with -lrb- rsic , dd , gg -rrb- .
i also plan to use integrity gasket .
i &#8217; m planning two rows with a riser for seating .
the first row will be about 10.5 &#8217; from the screen and the second row will be 16.5 &#8217; .
based on seating and room dimensions , i &#8217; m tentatively planning for a 110 &#8221; -115 &#8221; wide scope screen .
i plan to use a grafik eye -lrb- 3106 or qs -rrb- for lighting control .
other than research and planning , the only tasks we &#8217; ve completed are to clear out the room , secure a building permit , hvac rough in and recently , electrical rough in , so this thread is beginning at the &#8230; beginning .
we started out wanting to clean up the front wall of our current family room set up , but after many months of research , we decided to go with a dedicated room .
the room will be in the basement .
a few calls for estimates to general contractors only stoked my already burning desire to diy .
i wanted to thank all the people who have inspired me to act on my desire for a home theater by detailing their own experiences .
i really appreciate the advice from those that have responded to my questions and posts .
oh yeah , the name of our theater is lewis family cinema .
it is a very fitting name given the tremendous involvement and support from everyone .
edit for index on 09/03/09 even with all of the pictures , my thread isn &#8217; t that large , but i decided to add an index and details section to make it easier to search the pics and read .
thanks to chinadog , jamis , oman , guam and queendvd for the idea .
i hope it &#8217; s helpful .
