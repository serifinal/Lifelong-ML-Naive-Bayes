i think it 's time to buy a screen .
any suggestions ? .
i recently moved into a new place .
in my old place , i always put off buying a screen for my sony vpl - hs20 because even projecting on a white wall the image looked better than most of my friends big screen tvs .
now i 'm installing my gear in my new place , and i 've discovered that the wall i intend to project on is not flat !
at first i thought that i had somehow damaged my hs20 because the image had a funny curve to it , but then i broke out the trusty laser level and found that indeed , my wall is not straight .
you can see in the picture " top " i lined up the top of the pj image with a laser level .
then in the picture " bottom " i move the laser level to the bottom of the pj image .
you can see the laser level light disappears on the bottom picture , showing where the wall curves inward .
so , now i 'm thinking that it 's time to buy a screen .
i assume i can get one with a rigid frame that wo n't conform to my wall 's poor shape .
what brand would you recommend ?
the image in the picture is about 108 " diagonal with the pj fully zoomed out , so a 100 " screen will probably be perfect .
thanks in advance !
eric
