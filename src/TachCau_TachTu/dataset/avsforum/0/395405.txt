vmc - is there any way to have theatertek default to dvd 's and powerdvd default to ... .
i just finished setting up my new htpc with theatertek and ffdshow ... and i love it !
i have it set to play as the default player within vmc using the mymovies plugin .
i have it set up to play my ripped dvd iso 's and ripped dvd mkv 's ( not so many mkv 's though ... taking 4 - 6 hours per dvd was worth it for me after a couple days of backing up ) .
anyways , i wanted to back up my blu - ray movies as well as make accessing them easier ( easier as in not getting up from the couch to open up a case ) .
i used anydvd hd to rip the files to the hard drive .
i took the main .
m2ts file and put that on my media server along with my other iso dvd rips .
so ... is there a way i can have vista media center default to playing my m2ts files with powerdvd ultra instead of loading theatertek ?
i 'm looking for a remote only setup here .
also , it would confuse the wife if she chose a movie with the mymovies app and some of them play ( iso 's ) but some do n't ( blu - ray ) .
she wo n't know the difference between the files ... she just wants to press a button on the remote and have the movie start right away .
i 've been doing some searching and i could n't find anything to answer my question .
i see a number of people use theatertek ( or zoomplayer ) for sd dvds and powerdvd ( or tmt ) for hd / blu - ray dvd 's ) ... i 'm just wondering if any of those people are able to have the right player open automatically from within the mymovies area of vista media center .
