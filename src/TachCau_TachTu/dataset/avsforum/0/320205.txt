* new * western digital - wd tv hd media player .
looks pretty cool no ?
http://www.engadget.com/2008/11/01/w...-media-player/ http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage....=1218008588808 wonder what file formats it supports .
this might be the perfect way to stream my 4gb + files that wont stream via my xbox 360 .
i have a spare hd / enclosure laying around that i could just stick in this thing .
