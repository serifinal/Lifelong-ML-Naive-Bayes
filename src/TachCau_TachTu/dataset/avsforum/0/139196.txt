early facts / rumors concerning " the dark knight " blu - ray master thread .
quote : nolan and thomas both brought up the anticipated blu - ray version and its capabilities .
nolan summed it up by saying , " the blu - ray , in particular , will be able to actually use the shifted aspect ratios as it appears on the imax screen because the 16:9 aspect ratio is sufficiently different from the 2:4 that you 'll actually see a shift on the blu - ray .
the resolution on the blu - ray is clear enough that you can actually see difference in grain structure and sharpness .
so i think it will be quite spectacular . "
there are a couple of elements that fans will not be seeing .
thomas said that it 's " unlikely " that the dvd will contain alternate takes of heath ledger as the joker [ during the junket , the filmmakers and fellow cast members mentioned how ledger would occasionally riff or improvise some of his dialogue ] , but pointed out that they have not decided anything for sure yet .
another popular feature that the dark knight dvd wo n't have according to roven : deleted scenes . "
we know there wo n't be any deleted scenes because there never are , " says roven , noting director nolan puts everything of importance in the actual movie . "
there were n't any on batman begins and there were n't any on this one . "
apart from that , nolan promised us some " very interesting extras " .
the man has n't failed us thus far , so we 'll be waiting in excited anticipation .
