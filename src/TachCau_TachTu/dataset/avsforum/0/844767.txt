what 's the scoop on 1080p for directv hd ??? .
today our directv hd dvrs all got an upgrade .
upon startup , there was a message noting 1080p is a new feature .
then in the menu , under resolutions , i enabled 1080p -lrb- along with 1080i , 720p and 480i , as i play native resolution -rrb- .
are the directv pay movie channels gon na be 1080 60p , 1080 24p or what ?
what 's the scoop here .
anyone know ?
and is the broadcast actually 1080p or is the receiver simply deinterlacing 1080i to 1080p ???
