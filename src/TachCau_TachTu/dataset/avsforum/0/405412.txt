what is the difference between the ex70 and home cinema 700 ??? .
okay , i have n't been able to find any reviews for the home cinema 700 - but there are some for the ex70 and they are n't good .
i know it is n't a home theatre mag , but pc mag reviewed the ex70 : http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817...129tx1k0000530 one section that leapt out at me was this : " video quality at 480p was good enough to consider bringing the projector home to watch movies on dvd at 480p , with acceptable skin tones and good detail in dark areas .
on the other hand , results on the hqv benchmark , a measure of video quality for standard - definition ( sd ) signals at 480i , were disappointing .
the ex70 scored a meager 10 out of a possible 130 , the lowest score i 've yet seen for any projector . "
hd is n't mentioned , but should we expect similar performance from the home cinema 700 ?
in the projectorreview test of the infocus x9 , the 700 is mentioned as a competitor : http://www.projectorreviews.com/info...petitors.php#6 if there are n't any real differences between the ex70 and home cinema 700 wo n't this new wxga be simply awful and a poor choice for any home theatre application ?
it is trumpeted as a low cost alternative , but how would it stack up against a benq w500 ?
and if there are n't any differences between it and the ex70 , what is the point ??? it 's not on my shopping list , but i think i 've been asked about the ex70 / home cinema 700 10 times now and i do n't have any answers .
which is why i am asking all of you .
