the " official " onkyo tx - sr706 owners thread .
well ... i assume this thread might be getting a lot of action soon .
the 706 comes with the multieq + dynamiceq + 1080p + a plethora of hdmi ins + the all important blue back - lit volume knob -- that is what sold me .
i have one being delivered this week .
i will report back with my initial impressions .
