yet another convergence question - epson 1080ub .
i just bought the 1080ub .
the convergence is definatly off .
one green here , one red here , etc. .
esentially - all the lines on the grid have a red/green companion - probably about one pixel each .
i guess my question is how picky should i be ?
how perfect should i expect that it can be before sending it back .
thanks much
