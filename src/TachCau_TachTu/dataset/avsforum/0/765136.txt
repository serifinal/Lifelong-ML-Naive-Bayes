show me your completed theater ! .
my favorite part of this forum is the build threads - but i always find it hard to figure out exactly what the `` finished product '' looked like .
-lrb- maybe that 's because no one ever really has a `` finished product '' ! -rrb-
the `` show me your '' threads are pretty good for this but for specific applications .
so , i want to see two or three photos of your finished theater !
feel free to leave a brief description as well .
the goal here is a to create a quick and easy gallery of completed theaters as a reference for both old and new members of the forum .
i 'll start : 108 '' laminate screen , mitsubishi hc 1500 .
you may notice i 'm not an audiophile or sound engineer .
regardless , i love the way it turned out .
