help with overscan on lg lcd .
hi , i have a ps3 connected via hdmi to an lg 32lc2d lcd .
the problem is the lcd has significant overscan that crops the displayed picture .
i tried adjusting the overscan option in the hidden menu -lrb- pressing the ` menu ' button on the remote and on the tv for few seconds will pop up the hidden settings menu -rrb- .
the image flickers for a second when adjusting the overscan but nothing is changed after that .
does anyone else have this problem or knows how to disable the overscan on this lcd ?
