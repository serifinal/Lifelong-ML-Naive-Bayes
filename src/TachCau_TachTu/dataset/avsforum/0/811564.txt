yet another gta iv thread , but this time it 's relevant ! .
is it me or when you go to audio options on the screen it ask you how your surround is setup .
looking at the text there is 2 options available , side or rear on how you setup rear channels .
but looking at the diagram it appears to have a unused 2 channel on the rear not available in the options possible 7.1 .
i tried applying pro logic iix or neo : 6 but no option came out for that unused option .
is it possible that rockstar games going to release a patch for ps3 ?
i also think that the audio output is a little weak .
i have to boost the volume too high to hear the dialouge yet the sfx is blasting .
also they did n't manage to have the same contrast of sfx and music which annoys me because i ca n't focus on the music anymore ... unless i ride a taxi cab the whole way .
