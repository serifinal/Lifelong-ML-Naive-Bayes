acoustic effects of ceiling fans in home theater .
i wonder how the ceiling fans will affect the sound system especially those on not - too - high ceilings .
the wave from low frequency surely will push the blades and those blades will viberate .
i have a 52 " ceiling fan on 8 ' ceilings just a few feet in front of the main speakers .
