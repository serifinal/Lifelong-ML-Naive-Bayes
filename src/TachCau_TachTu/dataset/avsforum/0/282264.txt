samsung dlp whole screen red .
color wheel ??? .
i 've got a hln5065w that just recently the screen went entirely red .
for instance when the tv is on and there is no source , the screen use to be bright blue .
now it is dark red .
when watching television all the colors appear to be working but everything is drenched in red tint .
i replaced the color wheel on this tv about a year ago because a loud bearing and it has worked fine until a week ago while watching tv everything went red .
is it possible this is a color wheel problem ?
not aligned correctly ?
not spinning fast enough ?
dmd board ?
thanks
