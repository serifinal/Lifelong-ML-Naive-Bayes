problem with dvd audio on pioneer dv - 47ai .
i 'm having a problem with my pioneer dv - 47ai .
it plays dvds and regular cds fine , but there is an issue with dvd audio cds .
( have n't tried sacds lately . )
on several different dvd - as , it seems to be missing a " track " from the audio .
not sure if that is the correct term , so let me describe what happens .
let 's use queen 's night at the opera , bohemian rhapsody .
most of the audio is fine , but some of the higher voices are very faint .
they sound like they are a long way away from the mic , which is why i said it sounded like a track was missing .
all these dvd - as worked great until recently so there must be a new problem of some kind .
anyone else had a similar problem ?
wondering if this is a fixable problem , or if its a buy a new player problem .
