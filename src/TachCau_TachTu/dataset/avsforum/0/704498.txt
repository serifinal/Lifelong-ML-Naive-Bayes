.
my old pc just died so i think i want to move to vista and dual connect it to my monitor and home theater .
problem is i did n't run -lrb- and ca n't easily or cheaply -rrb- hdmi so i 'd like to use component to my projector .
will blueray with vista work over component .
even if it does n't i can still view dvds over it .
i 've found links and post about general budget htpc but i do n't see much about using them with component outputs .
if i use component could i dual connect it to my monitor -lrb- vga -rrb- when i do n't need/want to fire up the projector ?
also if anyone wants to list their shopping list for a good budget system , i 'm listening .
most of the post i 've found are a few months old and we all know how much prices change .
hoping to spend around ~ 700 thanks , jb
