xbox 360 display settings with 800u .
i need help !
i have my panansonic th50pz800u connected to my xbox 360 elite via 1.3 hdmi cables .
under the 360 's display settings there is an item called reference levels .
you can set the reference levels to standard , intermediate , & advanced .
there is a caution though that if you set the reference levels higher than what you tv supports that the picture may become degraded .
can anyone confirm if i should be using standard , intermediate , or advanced ?
i tried all three and could n't tell if there was any difference .
