.
hi everyone !
i 've been doing research on a low-cost 720p pj to act as a 2nd tv in my home .
will only be throwing less than 15feet onto a wall , so . .
i 've come down to these three : -lrb- in order of preference -rrb- epson hc720 panny ax200u optoma hd65 hoping to find one on sale during boxing day for like $ 799 ?
that would be fantastic !
-lrb- just got married , not much $ $ floating around -rrb- however , i can not find anywhere in the toronto area that sells any of them .
mind you , i 've only searched the futureshop , bestbuy , costco.ca , some computer online stores ... really blind as to where else to look . .
could someone give me some pointers , please ?
even online retailers that will ship to toronto ?
or anywhere around that gta that might have them in store , but does n't have a online store , i wo n't mind driving over and taking a peek .
oh , and of course , any comments as to my 3 choices above is greatly appreciated also !
thank you in advance for your time .
