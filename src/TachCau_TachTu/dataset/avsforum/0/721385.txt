why plasma has so high brightness spec 's ? .
several plasmas ( samsung , lg , panny ) claim to have brigthness sepcifications of 1000 cd / m2 to 1500 cd / m2 .
any high - end lcd ( xbr4 , lnxx81f ) has brightness specs of 500 cd / m2 or less .
1 ) has anyone known technical reasons why plasmas can reach so big score , compared with lcd 's ?
2 ) and why plasma pictures ca n't get that bright in real life ?
( p.s. - i know brightness is not an important factor in pq evaluation )
