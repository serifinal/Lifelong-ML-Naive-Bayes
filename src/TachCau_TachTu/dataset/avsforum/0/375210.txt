yass - yet another speaker selection question .
i 'm in the final design stages of my new dedicated ht .
the room is about 12 ' x14 ' x8 ' .
for now , i will install a 5.1 system and perhaps expand later .
my amplifier will probably be an emotive xpa - 5 for space and aesthetics i plan in - wall l / c / r and on - wall surrounds .
the l / c / r will be behind an at screen ( sheerweave 4500 type ) question : my current design is polk lc265i 's for the l / c / r and polk lsifx for the surrounds .
any thoughts on this design ?
in - walls mean a big ' commitment ' as i ca n't audition them in my walls .... .
they are within my budget .
i tend to be very critical in purchases ; purchase in the mid-to-upper range ; and keep my h / w a long time ... .
fwiw , the screen wall is 2x4 construction just inside of a concrete block wall .
speaker procurement and installation are early in the build - out of the room ( due to the in - wall design ..... ) .
am i headed in the right direction ?
