samsung hl61a750 with panasonic dmp-bd35 / 55 .
i decided to create this thread for owners who have the dmp-bd35 / 55 connected to their hl61a750 .
my goal of this thread is to figure out the best picture settings while using these two devices connected .
i followed what are supposedly the `` best '' settings for the hl61a750 but i do not believe they are actually the best for use with this player .
please provide both your hl61a750 settings and your dmp bd-35 settings .
* i would prefer to have experts post what they consider are the best settings , since i am in pursuit of the absolute best picture possible -lrb- blackest blacks , truest colors , etc. -rrb- .
thank you !
my current settings are those posted by mike_pro for the tv .
not sure what to use for the panny .
