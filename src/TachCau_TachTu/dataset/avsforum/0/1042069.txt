samsung ln52a650 setup / calibration ??? .
i just got this tv and i ca n't seem to find a thread on how to properly set it up or calibrate .
is there anything i should do before i hook up it and turn it on ?
or can i just start watching tv right now ( btw i already have hi - def and have had it for several years w / my old dlp ) .
i know the first 100 hrs are crucial for plasma tvs , is it similar for lcds ?
