stations whose digital coverage area will be less than their old analog 's at 2/17/09 .
we 're familiar with the wect wilmington issue , where the digital coverage was less than its old analog .
and , i thought i read somewhere that this situation may be possible with 15 % ( ? )
of stations .
how about a list of notable examples ?
here 's one for starters : ktvo ch 3 kirksville mo ( abc ) 100 kw at about 1100 ' analog ch 3 ; 87 kw about 1000 ' digital on uhf ch 33 .
coverage radius shrinks from about 65 mi to about 45 miles .
