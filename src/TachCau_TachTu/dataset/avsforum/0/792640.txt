.
hello , i noticed today on the best buy website that the elite 's were on sale for 5 % off -lrb- $ 325 -rrb- .
i was under the impression elite were never on sale and the warranty would only apply if you purchased the tv at a retail store ?
i called another local store -lrb- star power -rrb- who said they were having a pioneer sponsored event where you get a 50 '' samsung for free if you purchase an elite plasma .
i called best buy to ask if the event was happening their and they said no .
they would give me $ 1,000 credit toward a 2nd tv if i wanted or they would take $ 1,000 off the elite .
is this too good of a deal to pass up ?
a 60 '' elite pro-151fd for $ 5,500 ?
or is pioneer going to drop the price again due to the economy and poor sales and i should wait until christmas or the super bowl for a better deal ?
bestbuy wanted me to buy a 4 year warranty for $ 780 !
does anyone know of a 3rd party insurance that would be just as good ?
is it better to buy the warranty from the place you bought the tv ?
thanks !
