dyslexic 's build .
ok ... after snowkarvers build .... i 'm in .
mine has a twist .
i have set aside a 13ft by 16ft space for the main theatre .... since i had to compromise with the wife and the ' kids space ' . .
i threw in an 11ft by 16ft space for a " wii wall " ... i just picked up my sharp lc46d82u flat panel for that ... i just hung that this afternoon in a temporary spot over the fireplace upstairs ... let the build begin ... pictures to follow .
i may be a bit slower than some of you faster guys as this also includes a bathroom and separate bedroom / gym .
