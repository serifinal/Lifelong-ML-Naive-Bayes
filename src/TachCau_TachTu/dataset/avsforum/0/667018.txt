improve quality of standard def on vista media center ? .
i 'm sure this has been brought up before , but i could n't find it in half an hour of search , so i thought i 'd start a thread with a to the point name .
my standard def quality in media center is awful .
it comes out most when watching sports .
there is awful ghosting and gross deinterlacing aftifacts ( looks like heat distortion like you see on roads in the summer , plus objects do n't move together when there 's camera shake . )
my tv is n't great for time response , but i know it 's not this bad ( sometimes i 'll see 4 + frames of ghost . )
dvd , hi def and gaming output look fine .
my tuner card is an old hauppauge wintv pvr - 150 .
might that be the problem ?
i 'm perfectly willing to spend the few bucks to get a modern tuner card if that 's the problem .
other pertinent specs are vist home premium 32 , radeon hd4850 ( i 've seen the same performance on x700 and 7600gt as well , ) and a 768p ( 1366x768 ) lcd .
i have the problem using both dvi and vga ( at 720p , the tv does n't support 768p over vga . )
are there any simple fixes for this , or is it something inherent to low - res interlaced tv that is causing the problem ?
