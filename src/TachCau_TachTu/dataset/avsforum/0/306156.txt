the lost boys : the tribe . "
the lost boys : the tribe " ( or ' the lost boys 2 ' ) actually was n't as bad i expected it to be .
i 'm a hugh fan of the original " lost boys " and i expected tlb2 to be a quicky straight to dvd pos .
to my surprise i found myself enjoying this sequel of vamps with it 's occasional over the top gore and typical 80's gratuitous naked breasts ( especially the very hot canadian singer moneca delain - bsg fans may recongize her from her small role as ' blonde woman ' in ' battlestar galactica : the miniseries ' ) !
it was fun seeing the return of two of the original cast members ' corey feldman ' as ' edgar frog ' and " corey haim " , in a small cameo as ' sam emerson ' ; not to mention the " sax player " ( unfortunately jamison newlander 's scenes as alan frog were cut ) .
once tlb2 was over i wanted to pull out my copy of ' the lost boys ' and rewatch it .
worth a rent .
just go into it with low expectations and you may find yourself surprised .
it 's not the best but it 's not the worst i 've ever seen .
if you enjoyed the original and miss the gratuitous naked breasts found in most all 80's movies then you will enjoy ' the lost boys : the tribe " .
available in sd or blu ray from netflix , amazon.com , etc. etc
