sony bravia kdl - 46w4100 red line on right side ? .
hi i just purchased a bravia kdl - 46w4100 about 3 weeks ago .
about a week ago i started to notice when i turn on my tv it will have this red line on the right side it 's about 3 inches wide and runs from top to bottom .
after a few minutes it will fade away .
can someone please tell me if i should contact sony or is this something i can fix with a firmware update currently i have the latest update on sony website .
thank you
