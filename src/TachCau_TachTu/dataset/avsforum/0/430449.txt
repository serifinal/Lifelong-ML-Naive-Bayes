how are you storing your bd/hddvd movies on your media server/htpc ? .
dvds are pretty easy .
you either rip it as an iso or in folders and if you want reconvert it to another codec .
hd is alot more complicated i am just curious how everyone is storing them .
i have found it easiest to break apart the disks and extract the feature .
i usually keep it in a single evo or m2ts depending on the format .
if there are any special features worth keeping on there , i have a seperate folder for those .
the field of dreams doc about the real field is a good one .
same with the chronicles of riddick doc .
i have thought about converting the evos to an mkv , but nothing seems to be easy at this point with hdm -lrb- not that it was with dvd 2-3 years out ... .
i remember having to fiddle with flaskmpeg and a host a little programs until dvdfab came out -rrb- i have thought about just keeping the whole iso , but it can really eat up space quick .
i use nero 8 as you can play these files back individually with truehd support -lrb- dts-ma is still a problem it seems although dts-hd seems to be working -rrb-
