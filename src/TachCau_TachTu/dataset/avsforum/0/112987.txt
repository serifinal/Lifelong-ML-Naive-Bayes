why do people mount fps so high ? .
i swear this drives me insane ... why do you always see fp tvs mounted 5 - 7ft in the air ?
i ca n't tell you how many people put them above fireplaces or just high on the wall . .
what is it , 50 % or more of lcd and plasma owners ?
who wants to stare up at a tv like a security monitor ?
