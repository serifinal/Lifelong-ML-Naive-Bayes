oops ) .
can someone pm me the commandment 's i never got my full copy .
to save time ( read as to lazy to type it all over again ) i am copying what i stated over at the " motivation " thread about my build , if you already read carry on below the blue : " the details , i started my build in jan. 07 thus far i have completed the following : framing , i am not using staggered stud or rsic clips etc. ... just standard framing .
when i purchased my home the framing for 3 of the exterior walls in the basement had already been framed and insulated .
so i had to frame up the theater wall , mechanical room wall the last remaining exterior wall which is side facing the garage .
i also framed a half wall and door underneath the steps coming down for equipment and a seperate closet for electrical panel and water meter .
during this process we had some heavy rains in spring , this led to the discovery of cracks in the foundation wall in two sepeate areas .
my builder being none reponsive had to be taken to small claims for recoup of the repair costs .
electrical , ran all the wiring , receptacles , lighting fixtures .
my room width is eleven and half feet so i 'm not doing sconces .
i have 8 recessed 4 " cans .
hvac a friend helped me complete this , last summer - fall .
seperate cooling unit , additional heating zone on boiler for forced hot air .
sheetrock in theater room done .
single layer 1/2 " densarmor .
no double drywall , green glue or the like .
pleasantly when i had the supebowl party in a still under construction setup with about 20 people in the room and sound blasting , another guest came and said if she did n't know i was completing the basement she would have never known we were down cause is was so quiet .
riser done , then re-did to raise an additional 3.5 inches .
stage done loaded with sand .
both stage and riser decoupled .
dricore in ht room done .
walls primed ceiling painted .
i wanted to prime the walls incase i did n't do fabric panels and simply to seal the walls .
primed with grey tinted kilz2 actually looks pretty good as a color .
i have since obtained dazian cloth ( thanks dave ) and have to fomulate some wall panels .
i 'm doing 4x6 star panel inside of the 8 recessed can area .
panel is done , ceiling frame is done .
need to install and surround with crown and trim .
the rest of the basement is an open area in the process of being sheetrocked .
need to finish : sheetrock - mud & tape prime and paint this same area dricore the rest of the basement install doors on mechanical room , equipment closet , electrical closet finish pocket door ( yes i said pocket door , look at what i would name build thread for reference !! )
and surround for home theater room which is located at the front of the theater room .
i am doing everything i can to help insulate the hollow cavity .
install cabinets for kichenette area and perhaps a concession / bar counter .
install engineered laminate flooring outside of ht and carpeting inside of theather and stairs coming down .
install drop celing in rec room and gym area ( theater room has sheetrock ) along with recessed lighting trim and in ceiling speakers .
setup pool table , and wall mountd lcd .
finish projector shelf / soffit enclosure and setting up equipment false wall , cloth frames , screen frame " end of quoting thyself . .
i 'm gon na post some pics of some of my initial troubles and progress .
soon to follow pics of where im at now .
this loganator stuff really works
