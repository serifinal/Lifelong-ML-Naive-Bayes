cvg : gta iv xbox dlc will be bigger than san andreas .
**** disclaimer ***** -lrb- words from the original link -rrb- future publishing have just released their cvg gta iv special .
the whole magazine is dedicated to the biggest videogame franchise of the 21st century .
what stands out is their blatant lust for the xbox 360 version over the playstation 3 version .
why ?
because of the downloadable content of course .
cvg compares the xbox 360 exclusive dlc to the vice city & san andreas games in space and scope , and claims the dlc will feature a brand new city .
i 've included the whole quote here so the comments can be viewed in their full context .
`` of course , to call games as vastly ambitious as vice city or san andreas mere ` expansion packs ' seems childish , but nevertheless , the downloadable content -lrb- dlc -rrb- coming for the xbox 360 version of iv has repositioned those games in just this way .
dlc so far has meant the odd new car , jumper of bit of horse armour , but gta iv is set to completely redefine the idea with expansions that are to gta iv what vice city or san andreas were gta iii .
yes , rockstar is clearly hinting at new downloadable cities ; and the chances of them being london , vice city or sa again are slim to none .
so that 's new as in brand new .
gta iv 's liberty city is the beginning .
think about that and be excited . ''
what should be noted is that this special edition magazine has been sponsored by microsoft .
there are advertisements for the xbox 360 edition of gta iv -lrb- with dlc -rrb- as well as other 360 games including ninja gaiden ii and lost odyssey .
in this context the comments by cvg sound suspiciously like advertorial - e.g. paid for editorial .
if this is the case than cvg really should follow proper journalistic standards and clearly label the piece as such .
nevertheless a full new gta city coming to xbox 360 in autumn ?
those houser brothers better get their skates on .
