the p - town south wing home theater build .
current status 05/11/09 : 97 % complete .
needs acoustic treatments & equipment room curtain .
projector & blu - ray player purchased and installed .
hello all !
i?m going to join the fray and begin my home theater build thread , adding the hundreds ( ? )
already here .
i really wish i had come across these forums sooner , as i have been neglecting the future ht space for over a year now , due to frustrations with planning .
but , life goes on , and before i knew it , a little girl is on the way .
so this remodel has to get finished really quick ?
as the baby is taking over my office and our current tv area .
daddy is getting the boot out of the house and into the garage , but it is a better space and is a win - win scenario !
once miss junior is here , little time and money will be available to keep working on it for a while .
so ?
let the countdown begin for february 09 !
you comments , advice , complaints , snide remarks , and boxes of donuts are most welcome .
the area is a former two - story garage / workshop that we are converting to additional living space .
my wife and i purchased the house three years ago after specifically looking for this kind of expandability .
one section will be the ht , the other will be my office and studio .
the second story loft above the ht will be used for storage .
after completion , this will add another 520 livable square feet to our home .
for purposes of this forum , i?ll keep focus on the ht area , although i?m remodeling the rest of the garage into a loft and studio space .
take a quick gander at the overhead plans with electrical and low voltage schematics ?
