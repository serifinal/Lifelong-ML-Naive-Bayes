new ht / media rm : 5.1 or 7.1 question as well .
i just bought my first home , and am turning one of the rooms into a media room / ht / living room .
my current hardware consists of : 6.1 jbl northridge system ( not expensive , but works well for me so far - i play a lot of music on it as well ) sanyo z4 720p 16:9 projector 133 " da - lite cosmopolitan electrol matte white screen denon 1804 receiver ( this will be replaced with a denon 3808ci in about two days ) xbox 360 sony ns75h dvd player tivohd the room is 14 ' wide and 18.5 ' long with a couch against the back wall ( which puts the viewing distance about right for the screen size ) .
i do n't have hd dvd or bl - ray , and do n't really have any plans to upgrade .
dvd 's upconverted look great at 720p to me , and the majority of my media is streamed off the computer over the 360 or from the tivohd .
as such , with the new receiver coming in , and the lack of real room behind the couch , i 'm wondering if it makes any sense to move to a 7.1 speaker setup , or if i should just do 5.1 well ( since most of my source material will be 5.1 anyhow ) , and use the the amp to run zone 2 into the kitchen .
if i ever do move to hd dvd / blu - ray , i can always reclaim those outputs .
thoughts ?
