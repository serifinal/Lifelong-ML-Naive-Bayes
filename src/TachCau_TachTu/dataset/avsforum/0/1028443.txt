replacing defective panel - calibration - do i need to worry about it ? .
i have a samsung fp - t5084 1080p plasma which is about 11 months old .
recently , an entire row of pixels lit up .
i called samsung , and after one tech visit , the local tech person is telling me that they will be replacing the actual panel .
when the actual panel is replaced , does n't the set need to be recalibrated or something at the factory ?
are n't the electronics calibrated to the actual screen ?
the tech says not to worry " it will be fine " !
well , i do worry .
what do you guys think ?
should i be asking for an entirely new tv instead from samsung ?
