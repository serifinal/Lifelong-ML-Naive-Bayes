ca n't turn on / off polaroid 4641 - tlxb .
i was having problems with connecting my desktop to the polaroid , using a vga cable .
the computer would boot up , but then , before the " windows is starting up " screen came on , the picture would disappear , and i 'd get the " no signal " message on the screen .
the tv would then turn off , and then turn back on again , and do so repeatedly .
the only way to work it was to start the computer in safe mode , reset the display settings ( it did not seem to matter to what ) , turn off the tv , and restart the computer , at which point the windows connetion would go through .
i did this today , and i got a picture , but no sound .
i tried to change the input to something else ( cable ) , and i got a blank screen , and then was unable to change to any other inputs .
also , i could not turn the tv off , except by disconnecting the power .
when i plug the tv back in , the red power light ( standby ) comes on , and i can turn it to the blue on light using the on / off switch either on the remote or the tv itself .
however , there is no picture or sound , and the only way to turn the tv back off is by disconnecting the power cord .
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated .
