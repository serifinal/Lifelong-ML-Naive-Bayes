need help with pj selection with restrictions ! .
currently designing a new home and will have a theater room in basement .
design is complete and about to break ground .
meet with a local home theater design company to get a bid and suddenly realized i had a restriction that i never counted on .
we have heating and a / c ducting that is going to limit my maximum pj throw to 12.5 feet in a room that is 19 ' long .
i planned to have one row of seating at 14 ' and another back as far as possible on a raise platform .
the local company says the maximum screen size i can get is 103 " for a 16:9 ratio and only a couple of pj will work .
one being the jvc rs1x .
as much as i would love to have the jvc , it think it is going to break the bank , if you will .
are there other options that will work with these restrictions ?
hoping to stay in the $ 3k to $ 3.5 k range .
thanks in advance for any guidance !
