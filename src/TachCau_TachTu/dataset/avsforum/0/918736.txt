any ex-sony owners converting / converted to canon high def camcorders ? .
four years ago , after my daughter was bron , i purchased a canon minidv camcorder afetr what i thought was due research .
although there were cautionary posts / reviews out there about the canon 's lack of low light performance , i bought the canon due to a considerable price difference between it and the comparable sony .
long story short , i sold teh canon after 2 months and purchased a sony trv .
this time around , after using the sony trv minidv for 4 years and being overall happy with the performance , i did not even give canon a chance and have been researching / reading posts / reviews only regarding the sony sr - 11/12 series .
i have lately decided to wait till past thanksgiving to see if there are more price drops due to economy / low consumer spending etc and i now have more time to research .
professional website reviews aside , i am looking for feedback from ex sony camcorder users who have had a chance to try the new canon series .
i am mostly interested in low light performance differences , ease of use , editing software differences between the sony and canon etc. .
thank you all for your feedback .
