anderson cinema construction begins !!!
... slowly . .
well , after few pictures and a hint from bud , " uh !
, hey man , you need to start a thread " ... .
here it is .
of course , the room is a dedicated home theater " man cave " , whichever you prefer .
it is a blank slate .
the hvac guys will be here tomorrow to install all the ductwork and set the 2 - ton unit .
i will complete the rest of the wiring for the reccessed lighting , track lighting , and oter lights i plan install .
seems to take a little bit to install 36 reccessed lights and three track lights , and billards lights ( to go over the pool table ) and fans , light / fan combos in the bathroom and the other other points for power bud reccommended .
so , if i could get away from looking at all the pictures on here and reading about the ways to build a ht i might be able to start on my ht .
also , we have an area within the ht that will house the a / v rack , dvd / cd storage , popcorn machine andconcession stand .
i will put a laundry list of cables together this week and get that stuff ordered .
room size : 12 ' ( w ) x 16 ' 3 " ( l ) so , anything you think i should do or put in the wall before drywall goes up , please chime in .
by the way , the lighted movie poster box with chasing lights came from a hollywood video that closed down here last week ... .
i could not pass it up for $ 65 .
