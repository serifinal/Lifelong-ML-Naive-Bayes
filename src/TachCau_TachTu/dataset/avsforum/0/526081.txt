how to determine throw for zooming .
if you 're considering zooming your projector on a 2.35:1 screen , this might help you out .
as i mentioned in an earlier post , calculating the throw range for zooming is different than if you are using an anamorphic lens .
when you zoom , you have to be able to hit 2 different screen widths from the same lens - to - screen distance .
if you have a sony vpl - vw60 and a 54 " x 127 " 2.35:1 screen , you will need to be able to fill a 96 " width ( 54 " x 96 " ) for 16:9 content , and also a 127 " width for 2.35:1 content .
the vw60 has a throw range of 1.4 x to 2.4 x .
so where should you put the projector ?
first figure the throw for the 127 " ( 2.35:1 ) width : 1.4 x 127 " = 178 " minimum 2.4 x 127 " = 304 " maximum then figure the throw range for the 96 " ( 16:9 ) width : 1.4 x 96 " = 135 " minimum 2.4 x 96 " = 230 " maximum the overlap is where the projector will be at a usable distance for both widths .
as you probably figured , you do n't actually need to do all 4 calculations , just these : multiply your 2.35:1 width by the shortest pj throw to get your minimum lens to screen distance .
multiply your 16:9 width by the longest pj throw to get your maximum lens to screen distance .
so in our case above , the lens to screen distance should be between 14 ' - 10 " and 19 ' - 2 " ( between 178 " and 230 " ) .
and as i 've mentioned in previous posts , it 's a good idea to leave yourself a little bit of a fudge factor .
i would narrow this range by a few inches just to be on the safe side .
