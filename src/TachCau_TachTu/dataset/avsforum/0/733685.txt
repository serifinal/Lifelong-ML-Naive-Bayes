how are you storing your disks after you rip them ? .
i do n't have a massive collection but i do have about 600 movies with cases and it 's over running me .
i have ripped them to the computer and will need to access them occasionally as i find which ones may not have ripped properly , or if i need to play it somewhere else in the house where i do n't have an extender .
i have them in open racks right now and having to dust them is a pita , and now that they are stored on the server , i wo n't need them out in the open .
i would like to have them in drawers or shallow tubs with lids and could possibly build a rack for the tubs and put them in my storage area out of the way .
i do n't know ... .
i 'm wondering what others are doing with their collections and how they are storing them once they have them ripped ?
