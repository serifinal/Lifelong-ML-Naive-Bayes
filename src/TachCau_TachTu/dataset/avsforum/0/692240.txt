design a home theater to beat bose acoustimass ?
10 speaker system .
i heard the bose truelife demo yesterday at cc .
at $ 1799 it is way out of range but for $ 999 acoustimass 10 speaker system sounds ok .
my question is : can i beat this system 's sound quality / clarity / setup / price by going with other brands like polk , klipsch ( onkyo or pioneer ) .
please suggest some setups .
anks
