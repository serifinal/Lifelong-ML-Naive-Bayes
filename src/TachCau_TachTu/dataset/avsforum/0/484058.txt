multiple display issues w / projector .
i have a htpc ( running win xp sp3 ) that i 'm trying to connect to a projector and a small lcd monitor simultaniously .
i have a 7900 gtx to accomplish this , with the projector hooked up through the component output of the card , and the lcd into an dvi to vga adapter .
i just installed a blu ray drive and bought powerdvd ultra and play blu ray disks just fine on the projector .
i have the monitors in dualview mode .
here 's the problem : i can only play dvds on the lcd .
as soon as i move the window to the projector , i get a dvd playback error , claiming my resolution is too high .
i 've humored this and turned it down to 800x600 with no luck .
dvds refuse to play through any software player ( nero showtime , wmp , powerdvd ) on the projector .
i 've updated every driver i can think of , reinstalled every player , and even tried multiple dvd drives .
none play on the projector .
the lcd is fine .
i 've disconnected the lcd at this point fearing copyright issues .
still no dice .
i have watched dvds through the projector before the blu ray install , and even after the install before i got powerdvd , on the projector .
i am out of ideas .
a million thank yous in advance .
