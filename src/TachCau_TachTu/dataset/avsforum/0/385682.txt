need recommendation on receiver for my setup please . . .
i 'm a noob in this home theatre thing .... btw i 'm from kuala lumpur , malaysia and i do nt really trust the salesperson at the shops here ... they do nt seem to know a lot about the stuff they 're selling ... most of the time i hv to resort to expert / user reviews and forums on the net .
nway i just bought q acoustics 1010i speaker package yesterday but i 'm not sure what receiver to get ... i 'll be using it mainly for gaming i.e. ps3 ( hdmi ) and xbox360 ( hdmi ) .
occasionally i 'll be using it for dvd or blu - ray via ps3 .
after searching n reseaching on the net i 'm torn between denon avr1909 , onkyo tx - sr605 / 6 and yamaha rx - v663 .
my room is around 12 ' x 8 ' just for information .
nway would really appreciate your help on this ... if there 's any other receivers suitable for my usage please recommend one n if possible the reasons as well yeah ??
thanks guys .
