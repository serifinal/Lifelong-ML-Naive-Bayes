toshiba 52hm84 ballast issue ? .
i have a toshiba 52hm84 , i bought used .
of course it does n't work .
the seller did test the bulb in another 52hm84 and it works .
when i turn it on , the tv powers on , have audio for about 10-15secs , then pwrs off .
then it cycles about 10 times , i can hear the color wheel spin up each time .
and there are a series of clicks coming from what sounds like the tuner board , and eventually halts .
the red led stays on , green flashes .
according to the service manual it says a lamp failure or light engine .
i 've also been reading that a faulty balast can cause this .
seems the common price is about $ 100 for this part .
i 've searched the web , and found what seems to be two different ballast .
23122468 is listed for my tv model , but i 've read on other forums that someone has used a 23122468p in the same model .
can anyone tell me the differenced between these two balast 's ?
23122468 vs. 23122468p i 've found them listed at ecompassparts , but they do n't describe the compatible models .
i also have found both at tigerdirect .
but this is where i 'm confused , according to tigerdirect , the 23122468 is a direct replacement for 23122468p and vice versa .
if you click on the actual product link 23122468 works for 46hm84 , 46hm94 , 46hm94p , 52hm84 , 52hmx84 , 52hm94 , 52hmx94 , 62hm14 , 62hm15 , 62hm84 , 62hmx84 , 62hm94 , 62hmx94 , but 23122468p works for only two models listed , 46hm84 & 62hm94 can anyone tell me , are these the same two parts ?
one 's just refurbished and the other is factory new ?
only reason i 'm so concerned is i 'm flat broke most of the time , and one is half the price .
thanks edit : i just found out the difference .
there is none .
apparently 23122468 is a toshiba factory part , i guess made during that dlp model 's production run .
and the 23122468p is a direct replacement , made after the dlp model is discontinued , contracted by another company , but stamped with a toshiba logo .
so all in all , same part , two different manufactuers , two different prices .
