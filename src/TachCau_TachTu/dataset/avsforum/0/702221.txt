klipsch synergy sub-12 any good ? .
here 's the dilemna ... i work part time and in college -lrb- read as i 'm broke ! -rrb- .
i just rounded out my 5 channel system .
i am running : onkyo 605 receiver infinity beta 50 l/r infiinity c250 center infinity beta 20 l/r back .
i heard the beta 's are some of the best for the price .
so it seems , they sound awesome !
however , my room is shaped like a backward `` l '' and i need a sub for the low notes .
a background .
the room is hardwood floors and including the side office room -lrb- completely open -rrb- , it runs about 2500 cubic feet .
-lrb- 310sq/ft floorspace with 8 foot ceilings -rrb- .
i can get , through work , a klipsch synergy sub-12 for about 180 shipped .
i was wondering if anyone thinks this would be a good or bad investment ?
i do n't want to spend more than i have to , but i also do n't want to cheap out and not have it work as planned .
i was thinking ed for a sub -lrb- i use all their car products and had them well before they even got into home audio -rrb- , but for half the price , would this suffice for my room specs for a 1.5 to 2 years until i move out and make a enough to buy a more expensive sub ?
should i wait another 3 months and buy an ed ?
i just want to know if i should just save the 200 and put it toward a ed or if this will satisfy me for two years and thus be a good investment .
will it work with a room with that airspace , etc ?
i do n't know what size/wattage/tuning / etc. is recommended based or airspace or whatever ... i know nothing about doing that .
