sony dilemma - w4100 or xbr6 .
hi everyone -- i hope you guys can help me out .
i 'm rather new to a more technical analysis of lcd 's and i 'm at a loss .
i want a high - end 52 " lcd tv .
because i have a lot of ambient light in my living room , i have decided to go with sony , not samsung .
i went to the local howards and saw the w4100 .
it looked fine .
the recent cnet review about the fluctuating blacks , however , worries me .
that 's probably my only concern .
now i 've seen the news that xbr6 will come out in 52 " .
my understanding is that xbr6 is similar to the z4100 from a tech standpoint , in that it has an lcd backlight .
here are my 2 questions : 1 ) what advantage does an lcd backlight provide ?
i could not find images online but does anyone have a description or an image comparison ?
2 ) of course the xbr6 is better than the w4100 , but how much better is it ?
will the images produced be so noticeably different that i would hands down pick an xbr6 , or are they marginal ?
i would be watching hdtv 60 % of the time , dvd 's 30 % of the time and videogames 10 % of a time on an xbox .
hope this was n't a repost .
pardon the ignorance and thanks !
