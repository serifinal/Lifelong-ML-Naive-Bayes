photo journal ( construction & ht build progress ) .
welcome to cedar peaks cinema stop !!!
click here to check out the final cedar peaks cinema photos ( updated december 2010 ) first of all , i want to thank everyone in the avs construction community who have helped me in the past few months and offered their input and shared their expertise which really helped point me in the right direction .
i have started with knowing virtually nothing about home theater construction when i first started thinking about doing this project .
so i honestly can not thank all of you enough for inspiring me to start my own ht construction .
this project officially started in june 2008 and main construction was finished 60 days later ( framing / wiring / electrical / insulation / drywall ) .
my goal is to finish the entire project no later than november 13th ( this year ) , which is the time when my parents and my brother?s family will come to visit us in colorado .
i had framed the basement , ran av wiring through smurf / resigard conduit and attached insulation with the help of my wife , brother - in - law , and a couple of friends over the past 2 months .
due to the time crunch , we opted to hire a drywall crew to hang drywall , tape and mud at a very low cost which saved us a lot of time and extra work and cost very little .
we also hired a master electrician to do the electrical based on the plan i provided him with .
we had already paid for a structural engineer and a general contractor prior to construction to perform a structure post move which allowed us to open up the basement into one big room instead of two divided smaller rooms .
( all photos posted on 2nd post ) ( details on construction on 3rd post ) ( details on av and misc equipment on 4th post ) ( contractor / dealer info posted on 5th post ) what?s left to be do - as of september 15h 2008 : get with electrician to discuss final trim for lighting and electrical , including the addition of mud - rings needed on all electrical outlets , av outlets , and sconces affected by the addition of 1 ?
