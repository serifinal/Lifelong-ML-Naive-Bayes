the scrapwood theater build .... .
well &#8230; almost done .
i thought i would share my &#8220; mom . .
where &#8217; s dad &#8221; project .
my theater is 15 &#8217; x 12 &#8217; 9 &#8221; with 8 foot ceilings .
its part of a complete basement overhaul project that was started 3 years ago .
my main goal for the theater room was to create a beautiful room for as little money as possible .
i consider myself an expert wood worker , and also being part dutch ( penny pincher ) i thought i could pull it off for well under $ 10,000 , including seating .
it was more of a personal contest than anything else .
the screen is 110 " .
painted wall , behr silver screen .
looking at buying 5 berkline 88 seats ; two rows of seats .
2 seats in the front row and 3 seats on the riser .
with that being said , over the last two years i &#8217; ve become very creative at finding ways to reduce the cost of the room .
this is the results so far &#8230; .
i &#8217; ll post more pictures soon .
but for the time being , i hope you enjoy them !
