started construction today !
help with projector please . .
finally started construction today .
i 'm taking the lessons learned from the great members of this site and incorporating as many of the tips as possible into our ht .
now , i need to finally settle on a sub $ 3,000 projector .
help !
here are the room specs : 18 ' x 15 ' .
ceiling will be 7 ' 8 '' .
the room will be dark as it is in our basement .
i am building diy screen using the highly recommended goo .
i 'm thinking the screen should be in the 90-100 inch range .
what do you guys suggest for the projector ?
i 'm leaning toward the epson 1080ub or the benq w5000 .
however , i am basically clueless .
any suggestions ?
thanks in advance .
