is it possible to do correct color calibration with just the rgb filters ? .
i have an old 20 " sony crt with which i 'd like to " experiment " as it was only $ 424 in 1998 so even if it got messed up , it would n't be a huge deal .
is it possible to have proper color using just the red , green , and blue filters , avia1 and using these items in the service menu ?
