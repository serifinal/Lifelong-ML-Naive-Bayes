xbox 360 display " reference levels " ( question for amir ) .
i want to make sure i 'm getting the best display for computer graphics from my xbox360 , as i use it mostly for gaming rather than video playback .
as far as i can tell , the xbox 360 only outputs rgb over hdmi , even when playing dvd ( unlike a dvd player that will output ypbpr ) .
the problem is there is two standards for rgb - pc levels where 0 is black and 255 is white , and video levels where 16 is black and 235 is white ( 0 - 16 is below black , 235 - 255 is above white ) .
dvd uses ycbcr video levels , computer graphics are generally rgb at pc levels .
the xbox 360 has 3 options under " reference levels " in display , that seem to have the following effect : standard - produces video levels ( 16 - 235 ) intermediate - something in between ( ? )
expanded - produces pc levels ( 0 - 255 ) now what i 'm asking is does the xbox 360 natively produce computer graphics at video levels , complete with below black and above white like dvds , or is it converting computer graphics to video levels by default ?
which option should i use if i want to avoid conversion / least banding in video games ?
my samsung tv has two options for rgb over hdmi - normal and low so it can cope with either .
