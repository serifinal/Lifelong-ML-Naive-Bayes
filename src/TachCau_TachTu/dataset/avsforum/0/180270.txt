intel g35 chipset overscans on 720p & 1080i with lg 42px5d 42 " plasma tv .
dear readers , i purchased a asus p5e - wv hdmi motherboard with the intel g35 chipset and have connected it to a lg 42px5d 42 " plasma tv .
however , when setting it to the 720p and 1080i resolutions it overscans .
i can find no config options to change this .
i have skyhd and a dvd upscaler which both work fine at 720p and 1080i so i can only believe that it is the intel g35 chipset drivers .
in a previous thread ( http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1024233 ) , archibal and woozy helped me to add the resolutions 1366x768 & 1360x768 using dtd calc and some modelines they found .
however , i have noticed that my tv works best with 720p and 1080i so now want to solve the problem of the overscan .
any advice on how to correct this overscan would be greatly appreciated .
thanks for your help .
