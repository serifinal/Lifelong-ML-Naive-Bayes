samsung ln32a450 32 - inch 720p lcd hdtv .
i 've built a linux - based mythtv htb / pvr and am using a samsung ln32a450 as the display .
i 'm using the latest proprietary nvidia drivers with a 9600 gso based card .
i had originally connected to the tv using a dvi ~ > hdmi cable .
this worked , but the only resolution the tv seemed to accept was 1280x720 ( native for this tv is 1360x768 ) .
colors were wonderful but you could tell the resolution was non-native by the blockyness of fine details like text .
annoying .
i then connected via the vga port ( dvi ~ > vga adapter and vga cable ) .
this time i got the native resolution ( very nice and crisp ) but the colors are very washed out .
does anyone know of a way to get native resolution * and * vibrant colors on this set with a pc for input ?
this is really starting to get on my nerves tia ... james
