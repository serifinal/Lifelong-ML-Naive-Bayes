popcorn & coke , etc. : a smattering of new movie snack slides now , you 're asking ... .
what is this bonus video content you mentioned ?
well , i 've created some short ( 15 to 30 seconds each ) " bumpers " that you can use to introduce themed trivia segments .
i 'm including these for the indiana jones , disney and harry potter trivia that i 've made for volume 5 .
but i 've also gone back to previous volumes and made video bits for the star wars and james bond trivia sets .
( for a hypothetical volume 6 , i may do star trek , superman , alien , austin powers or die hard , dirty harry , or jason bourne bits . )
they 're not award - winning or anything , but are a fun thing that i tried ... just to see what my meager computer / video skills could do .
i 'm sure those of you with the dvd sets of these movie series will recognize some of the backgrounds , etc. .
i scavenged desktop wallpaper pix , dvd menu screenshot grabs , etc. .
whatever i thought could be usable ... vol. 4 ( 200 + slides ) specs : refreshing movie moments : 35 slides ( new template layout ) james bond trivia 2007 edition : 40 slides ( 20q & 20a ) template updated to daniel craig .

another year , and the price of everything continues to increase : blank discs -- with over 1,000 slides -- plus video clips now -- the collection has grown in size and will not fit onto a cd - r. i now use dvd - r. with the inclusion of the video clips , it is nearly 4 gb .
petroleum prices have ended the days of a spool of blank discs nearly free after mail - in rebates ... disc cases -- if it 's made of plastic ... as discs and cases are , chances are the price of them has increased .
padded bubble mailing envelopes -- trying to track down deals ; i 'm getting relatively good bulk prices from ebay sellers sometimes ... postage -- what ?
the post office increased their rates ?
i 'm shocked !
media and 1st class rates have both increased again .
gas -- to make the trips to the post office -- the less said about this the better ... ugh !
paypal -- the % they get for their service now , prices on all the above things have n't increased obscenely ( except for gas ) but taken as a whole , they do add up .
with this in mind , i 'll have to increase the minimum paypal to $ 7.00 .
that is sufficient to cover the disc , case , mailing padded envelope , postage and paypal 's % cut of the payment .
if interested , paypal to : sgood3 ( at ) comcast ( dot ) net < -- i think you can figure out how to make this a valid email address .
as always , tips are certainly appreciated , but by no means necessary .
the above amount will work for u.s. and canada .
for anyone across a large body of water , pm me and we 'll figure out what it will cost to get a disc to you .
i 'm still only sharing these by snail mail on a disc .
no downloading option .
( my son 's a ga tech computer science major and thinks this is quaint . )
and once you 've received a disc , please do n't upload them for redistribution elsewhere .
i 'd like to keep them here in the avs community .
pm with questions and please continue using this thread to post with suggestions on programs to use for making and using these slides , etc. .
the previous threads are also a wealth of information on how to make great pre-show intros .
the tips and tricks you share with fellow members are what makes this forum a terrific community to participate in , and why i enjoy being here .
thanks for your continued interest !
steven p.s. .
this is not designed to be a playable disc .
it is a data disc with raw jpeg picture files on it .
volume 5 has short avi and vob video files , too .
you are supposed to use your computer and video editing or slideshow creation software to create and author a pre-show slide presentation .
then you burn you completed project to dvd and play that in your dvd player .
there are dvd players that can display jpeg photos and video files from a data disc .
however , the files as burned on the disc i provide are not arranged in a manner that is very entertaining to watch .
again , this is just a data disc , not a finsihed pre-show presentation .
if you are unsure what steps to take , please read through this thread , as well as the previous threads regarding vol. 2 , 3 and 4 ( links for which are posted above ) .
those threads are a wealth of information regarding what programs avs members have used to create slideshows , what background music they 've included , programs they use to burn the finished project to dvd , etc. .
