decision help - sharp , toshiba , samsung lcds vs pana plasma .
i work for a company with a rewards program and have enough points for my first flat panel .
i view from about 8.5 - 10 feet away , and have enough points for a 42 " set .
my choices are toshiba lcd 42xv540u sharp lcd cd42d65u pana plasma th42px80u hitachi plasma p42a202 my input sources are standard dvd player , and hd cable ( rcn ) .
i tend to watch movies on cable and dvd .
i suppose at somepoint i will upgrade to bly ray .
i have read a lot of threads , and seem to have narrowed down to the pana or toshiba .
i have also read the 720p vs 1080p thread .
if " money " was not object and these were your choices which would you get .
if the pana " cost " 1/3 less than the toshiba which would you get ?
i like the sound of the toshiba as it has all the latest and greatest features ( 120hz , etc ) .
but many people on this forum really love the pana even though it is 720p .
thanks for input .
