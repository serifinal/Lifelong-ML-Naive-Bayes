what 's the best way to put fabric up on to the ceiling ? .
i 'm finding that light reflection from the white ceiling is becoming more detracting .
although i would love to paint my ceiling black , that is not an option due to waf .
i 've thought about putting up black ceiling tiles or foam , but then someone on the forum wrote that they had good results by putting up black fabric .
that sounds like a great idea , since it should be very light absorbing and reversible .
now , what is the best way to put some light to medium weight fabric up on to simple dry wall ceiling ?
i 've thought about using black thumb tacks , but it may not be strong enough .
small brads or nails into ceiling studs at regular intervals would likely do the job .
anyone have any other ideas on what might work and look good ?
