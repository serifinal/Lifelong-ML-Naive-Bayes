connecting dvd recorder to lcd tv .
forgive me if this comes off as a " dumb question " , but i just recently purchased a samsung lcd tv .
i have a directv hd dvr box and a ps3 plugged into 2 of the hdmi ports .
i have my samsung dvd - vr330 plugged into the component inputs .
now obviously with this setup i cant record from live tv to a dvd as my dvd recorder and satellite are not on the same input .
is there a splitter that i can use for this situation like the old rf splitters ?
or is there any other way to do this ?
thanks for any help !
