do i really have to double-drywall and greenglue the ceiling ?
is insulation enough ? .
ok so i am at the final phase of my framing -lrb- only soffits left -rrb- .
i dont have such a huge problem with my side walls , since they are concrete and with blanketed insulation all the way around , and my whole basement is less than 650 sqft so it will serve as my entire home theater area .
so i wont be using rsic or dd/gg-ing my side walls since i wont have to worry about adjacent rooms , only the floor above -lrb- which is the first floor with kitchen/dining/living areas - bedrooms are on second floor -rrb- now my dilema lies in whether i should double-drywall the entire ceiling surface wall to wall with green glue .
it will cost me about $ 450 to get 3 cases of 12 tubes to properly cover about 600 sqft or more of ceiling area , plus another $ 100 in additional drywall .
my only reservation is how much of an immediate and noticable benefit am i getting my spending another $ 550 on green glue and additional drywall , over just doing a single 5/8 '' layer of drywall and overstuffing the joists with insulation ?
the other issue that comes into place is that many people spend 100 's of dollars on dd/gg-ing their ceiling but then they end up with 10-20 open areas from recessed lights and supply/return air vents where the sound still escapes through the dd/gg insulated ceiling , and we 're back to square one after spend close to $ 600 to prevent this from happening .
can someone please advise ?
its not just about the extra money , its also about the extra time and effort needed to dd/gg the ceiling , and the fact the dd/gg layer will be extremely heavy and will just be a pain in the neck and back to install onto ceiling , even with a drywall lift .
