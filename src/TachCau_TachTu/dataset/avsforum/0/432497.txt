new sub from danley sound labs .
i am re-doing my ht and was looking for a new uber sub that would give the same or greater output as i had with quad subs -lrb- jl audio fathoms -rrb- , but in a single sub solution .
after a demo receintly at another forum members house -lrb- fugueness -rrb- the danley dts-20 was one of the subs i was considering .
in speaking with them , they mentioned a new ht sub that was about to be introduced .
i asked for and received more details and now have the danley couch sub on its way .
it is another tapped horn design -lrb- the dual 8 '' drivers -rrb- in the same price range as the dts-20 but is smaller with even more output .
the dimensions are 48 `` x45 `` x11 '' -lrb- hwd -rrb- hence the couch sub .
not sure there are any/many couches that could conceal this large box but it 's dimensions work beautifully for me .
i will be placing it vertically along a wall in my ht and pairing it with my new jtr t12lf lcr 's .
this was a blind purchase so i am hoping the sub lives up to the praise given it by the danley folks .
they are known for their engineering prowess so hopes are high .
here is a cad drawing of the sub .
