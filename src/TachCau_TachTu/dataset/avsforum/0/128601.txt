speaker placement for my home theater/bedroom .
hello everyone !
since i 'm in college and still live with my parents my bedroom doubles as my home theater room .
i absolutely love everything about home theaters , but the rest of the fam does n't really care .
so this is what i have to work with ... my room http://www.gliffy.com/pubdoc/1536870/l.jpg ok i have 5.1 ch and i 'm looking for some input on where i should put the front left and right speakers and the two surround speakers .
the center channel sits ontop of my tv stand .
moving the stuff in my room around is n't an option because of windows and other stuff i did n't include in the diagram .
just incase anyone is wondering the black square next to the sub is a pilar that goes all the way up my wall .
look forward to your suggestions !
