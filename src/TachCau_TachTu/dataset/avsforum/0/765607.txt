how should i set this up ? .
i need advice . .
i have a 20x14 foot room , 10 foot ceiling that has a wedding cake design that slopes up to 13 feet .
txsr605 , 3 front speakers , 1 sub , and 4 surround anyways . .
i have a couch at the back of the room . .
how should i set my back surround speakers ( the 2 speakers that are behind you ) ?
should i put them on the back edge of the ceiling and have them point straight down ?
advice would be great !
also , is it ok if i install non-rated inwall speaker cables in an attic full of insulation ?
i have monsterxp 50 feet speaker cables for my surround .
thanks !
