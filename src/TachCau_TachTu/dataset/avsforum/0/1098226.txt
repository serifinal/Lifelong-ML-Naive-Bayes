discrete power on vs power off -- not a toggle ( urc - r50 ) .
hi , i have a sony xbr , tivo series 3 hd , and a toshiba vcr / dvd combo .
i have everything working well to control the devices with the urc - r50 , but when i try to make macros to set up activities like watch a dvd , or watch tv , i am having problems with the power .
what i really need is a discrete power on / power off as opposed to a toggle .
since the power command just toggles the device on or off , it can easily be in the wrong mode when the macro is started and mess everything up .
i tried testing the remote with all the factory codes for my devices and even though there is a hard button for on and off , both the on and off buttons can turn the device either on or off .
is there a way to fix this so the off button will only turn off the device , etc ?
thanks !
