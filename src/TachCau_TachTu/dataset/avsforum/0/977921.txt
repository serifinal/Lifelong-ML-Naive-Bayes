ideal ht / game room in my new house ?? .
ok , i?m putting my student hat on and also my flame suit just in case ?
i tried the search function and didn?t find the results that i need or looking for ?
just bought a new house and need advise on which room i should use for a ht / game room ?
here are the extra areas that i have available ?
1 ?
10 ?
x10 ?
room ( 1st floor ) 1 ?
11.5 ?
x10 .5 ?
bedroom ( 2nd floor ) 1 ?
13.5 ?
x 14.5 ?
open loft area ( 2nd floor ) all areas has 8 - ft ceilings .
are the rooms too small ?
should i even consider the open area for the loft ?
or should i suck it up and accept that i?m never going to have an ht with my home layout ?
i am also adding a link to the floor plan of the home just in case someone wants to see the layout .
