eliminating interference - where to start ? .
i 'm at a bit of a loss as to where to start in order to eliminate interference i 'm getting .
i have all my equipment sitting in central cabinet under my plasma tv .
it looks something like this in terms of the individual shelves / cabinets : pvr | cable box | dvd | htpc dual receiver | for russound | cd | vcr | | ht receiver | | russound | i have rca 's from pvr , vcr , dvd , cd to ht rec .
i have rca 's from dual rec , cable box , dvd , ht rec and 2x htpc to russound i have rca 's from htpc to tv for video hdmi from pvr to tv ( rec is too old for hdmi ) for video my sub-woofer cable runs behind the unit and exits to the left i 've noticed a really bad rumble through my left speaker that sits above the pvr cabinet .
it is particularly bad when watching tv through the pvr with bassier shows ie .
lost .
i 've had the speaker checked and it has a clean bill of health .
i 've switched the right and left speakers and it 's isolated to the signal going to the left side .
no problems noted with surround speakers or the center channel btw .
when watching dvd 's no problem , when listening to audio sources through the ht rec no problem .
therefore , i 'm reasonably sure it 's a problem with the audio source for the tv being the pvr and it seems to be tied to bass signals being sent to the sub but i ca n't be sure ( uneducated guess ) .
there is a couple of splitters in this same cabinet as i 've split the cable to feed the dual receivers as well as split it to the cable box for the russound feed .
i was going to start by replacing the rca 's from the pvr to the ht rec but that 's basically a guess on my part .
any suggestions on this would be most appreciated .
thanks !
