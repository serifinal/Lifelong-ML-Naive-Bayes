dave 's " finally getting around to posting some photos " thread .
my theater is ( mostly ) done !
this was not exactly a diy project .
i 'm not handy at all with tools , but even more importantly , i simply do n't have the time to devote to this size of a project .
i work a full - time job , i 'm a divorced single dad ( who has a fiance ) , i 'm a published writer with another novel to deliver on a tight deadline , and ... well , that leaves no time for building out a theater .
so ... .
i was a crt front projection guy from 1999 ( bought my nec 9pg from alan here at avs ) until 2006 , when i moved out of my old house and bought a new townhouse nearby .
i got rid of the crt but kept most of the other equipment , though it went into storage since i had no place to set it up .
i designed a theater / bar area for my townhouse 's basement about a year ago , but was n't really ready to do anything about it at the time ( mostly because of cost ) .
fast forward a year , and i need some additional space downstairs for my fiance 's son ( he 's five ) and my son ( he 's nine ) to play so i do n't strangle them when they 're running around upstairs .
while i 'm doing that , i 'm also going to build my theater .
here 's the original layout i made : it was modified during construction , but not by much .
and i lost the bar , which because the boys ' playroom .
there was never enough room for a riser in the back , or really enough headroom , so from the start i was planning to make do with a large sofa of some kind .
