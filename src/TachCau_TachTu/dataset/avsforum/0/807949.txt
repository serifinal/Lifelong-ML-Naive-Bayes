samsung pn42a450 vs olevia 242t .
242t from olevia from target with 1080p lcd or pn42a450 from samsung costco 720p plasma ( two year warranty included ) basically the same price i have never owned an olevia , and thought it was not a very good brand , until i saw the reviews .
i have also never owned a samsung .
i have owned vizio and it is great , but i want to go from 32 " to 42 " does anyone own either of these tv 's , or have any recommendations ?
also , i have only owned an lcd , never plasma .
i have read quite a bit about the newer tv 's not having to worry about burn - in , but is that the case with all of them ?
i watch alot of tv , and i do n't want to ruin it .
i am playing xbox 360 , ps3 , watching blu - ray on the ps3 , and have a hd - dvr .
