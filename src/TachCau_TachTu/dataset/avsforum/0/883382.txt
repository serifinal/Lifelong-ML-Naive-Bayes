anyone know what sharp is up to ? .
i have a dt-500 , and i love it , but i 'd also like to get into 1080p .
my problem is that i have a very short throw -lrb- 9 ' 6 '' -rrb- to my 92 '' screen .
so many of the `` low '' cost 1080p projectors wo n't work .
i 'm partial to dlp , though i would consider the epson ub if they can sort out some of their quality issues .
what i 'd really like to know though , is if sharp is planning a low cost 1080p similar to the dt-500 or xvz-3000 .
