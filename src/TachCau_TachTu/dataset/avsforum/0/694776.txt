hdtheater 2.0 build thread .
hey guys , my build thread was a casualty of the data loss .
i will try to recap where i started to where i am in the next post .
fortunately , mine just got started and will not be too hard to get it caught up .
but for starters here is what my room will be .
room size : 15x25 will have 8 ' soffits running the length of the room with 9.5 ' ceiling in the center .
seating : berkline 088 's in a 3x3 configuration .
seats chosen will also give me the option of doing 4x2 if the needs arises .
