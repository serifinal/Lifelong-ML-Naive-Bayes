screen wall : .
i have visited this site numerous times over the last year .
i have approximately 98 % of the basement framed .
( except for soffits ) i need help / input on my dedicated ht and game rooms .
the theater is approximately 13 ' x 16 ' 9 " .
i have a riser built in place that is 13 ' x 62 " x 7 " .
this equals out to the seating being 16.5 feet from the screen on the rear row .
the front row would be 10.5 - 11 ' from the screen .
i plan on putting in a 110 " screen .
i am wondering if these dimensions are good or is the front row to close ??? i will be purchasing berkline 090 's or 091 's .
my seating setup would be 3 seats in each row .
this works well considering i would have space on each side of the rear row to put an audio cabinet on each side .
i 'll give some other thoughts on my next post and some pics to help out .
i need to finalize this because the more i look at it , the more i think i need to make changes .
if you guys could help on ideas and different posts , i would appreciate it .
like i always say , it is , what it is !!
: also , i 've attached some pics but does anyone know how to place them directly into the text post ??
