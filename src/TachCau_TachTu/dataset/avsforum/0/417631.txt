.
hello folks , i am not sure if this is the right folder but i did not see a dedicated installation folder ... if it needs to be moved please let me know and i will do so .
i bought a sony bravia kdl - 40v2500 lcd tv and a monoprice wallmount for 32 - 60 " tvs and i am having some questions about installing it .
i am planning on installing on a wall cut out that is 36 1/4 " wide .
the tv itself is 38 7/8 " wide .
by cutout i mean something like below , and the tv will be on the wall marked a. | | b | | --- a ---- | | | | c | the first question is this television too wide for the wall ?
i am planning on swiveling it at about a 34 degree angle so i believe it should fit within the cutout .
the second question is ... i believe that there is only one stud in this cutout which is scaring me , and the stud seems to be in the middle of the wall ( 19 1/2 " from c wall ) .
is this an issue or would i simply apply an anchor to the center and then add screws on the outside as well ?
is this a difficult install and should i get this done professionally ?
any help would be appreciated ... thanks guys !
