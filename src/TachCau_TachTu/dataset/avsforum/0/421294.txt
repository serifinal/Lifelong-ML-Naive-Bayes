panasonic pz80 / pz85 screenshots thread .
as people seem to benefit from seeing screen shots i thought i 'd start a thread for those of us with these sets .
lets see your screenshots !
my first attempts , not the best , but ... : my second batch , making some progress .
i 've since changed from warm to normal color temp so these are a bit warm and consequently red , the actual picture is much more subtle .
i should have worked on my white balance more when i processed these : and some sd material just to show off not only the 85u but the upconverting of the ps3 .
again , the photography could be a bit better .
