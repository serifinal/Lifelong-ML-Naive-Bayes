what are your top 5 most anticipated ps3 titles ? .
i know i got these marked on my calendar : 1 .
metal gear solid 4 - video games are video games , but video games made by hideo kojima are works of art. 2 .
grand theft auto 4 - san andreas got me hooked onto this series .
this is a no - brainer .
3 .
littlebigplanet - one of the most original ideas we 've seen this generation 4 .
street fighter 4 - i used to play street fighter non-stop .
hopefully this will bring it all back .
no idea when this is gon na come out though .
5 .
haze - i 'm really skeptic about this game , but i really hope this game turns out really well .
i 've held back on cod4 and ut3 because of haze .
final fantasy xiii and god of war 3 would be up there , but the release date isnt for a long while .
resistance 2 looks great too .
gran turismo 5 looks promising , but i 'm not a big fan of the genre .
was just wondering what everyone else is drooling over and absolutely ca n't wait for .
