lnxxa650 owners : do you have clouding / flashlighting ? .
lnxxa650 owners , thank you for being brave and helping all of us decide on this tv from the front lines .
if you would , please vote on the poll if you have clouding or flashlighting in your panel and reply here what size you own .
that way we can build some info on what sizes and how many people get problems .
that will help some of us ( me ) possibly roll the dice with a big river buy .
thanks guys !
