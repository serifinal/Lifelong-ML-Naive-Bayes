.
i recently obtained one of these amazing units for free form a man on craig 's list who wanted more room in his townhouse .
however , there is a problem .
when i turn it on , the screen is green with bright green horizontal lines that are a little wavy and unstable .
it remains lit for about 5 seconds and shuts itsself down .
i have stopped trying to turn it on in fear of making it even worse .
is this a power supply issue ?
is it the green crt that 's malfunctioning ?
i also hear kind of a squeeking noise after the pop and power down ... kind of an eep , eep , eep , eep ... weird .
the man who gave it to me said that he 's had this same problem fixed before , and it only costed him $ 150 and took the repairer about 15 minutes to finish .
so i 'm thinking that if it 's as simple as it sounds , maybe i can fix it myself .
i 'm no expert , but if it 's simple enough , i can do it ... any help would be greatly appreciated !!!
