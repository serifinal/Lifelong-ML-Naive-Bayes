mirage 550 speaker stopped working .
no lows and barely any highs .
greetings all .
i bought a pair of mirage 550 's -lrb- not the omni 's , the older set -rrb- from ebay last year .
great set of speakers ... but ... .
last night i noticed that the left speaker was n't working barely at all .
there is the tiniest bit of sound coming from the tweeter but barely .
i switched out the speakers and when attached to the right side speaker wire produced the same results .
i even switched out my vintage harmon kardon 730 for my surround sound sony amp .
i took out the tweeter and inspected all of the wiring , everything looks good ... anyone know what this could be ?
there is absolutely no sound coming from the sub ...
