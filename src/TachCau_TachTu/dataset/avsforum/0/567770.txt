c1663 theater .
c1663 is the lovely name i gave the house i designed and am currently building .
here is my story .
my wife and i have been house - sitting for the past year or so .
our house is in the process of being built , as we have to move out by the end of july .
we will live in the new house for 2 - 3 years , then build another and rent out the other one .
follow ?
being that it will be a rental later on down the road , i didn &#8217; t plan for a dedicated theater / listening room .
the floor plan is relatively open , with the kitchen , living room and dining room all being together .
the living room is where the tv / movie watching and music listening will go on .
this will be my first front - project setup .
my equipment list is the result of combining a paradigm 2 - channel listening setup with the klipsch speakers i had for movies .
mix and match .
that is why i don &#8217; t list a center channel or surround speakers .
at the present , we are using the tv that came with the house .
we sold ours and when we move , we won &#8217; t have one at all .
( i keep saying &#8220; we &#8221; because my wife is into this almost as much as me . )
here is what i am left with : harman / kardon avr 135 yamaha dvd - s1800 paradigm studio 20 ( left and right ) no center channel no surround speakers velodyne f - 1500 r 15 &#8221; sealed servo subwoofer ( oldie but goodie ) .
appletv no tv here is the kicker .
i work in the low - voltage home - integration as the bidding manager for lighting control , background audio , home automation and best of all : home theaters .
this isn &#8217; t new to me ; i just wanted to get opinions from all of the great minds here on avs .
i am open to suggestions and criticism .
first , here are some renderings i made of the rooms .
here is a birds - eye view of the room .
this shows hallways and a stairwell at the upper right , with a coffee table and area rug in the middle .
my work computer is slow and i don &#8217; t see a need for them to be picture - perfect , so no textures for you .
this is a perspective view showing the kitchen area at the lower left and dining room table on the right wall by the garage entrance .
you may have noticed the 2:35:1 screen .
i will use the zoom method .
i haven &#8217; t picked a projector yet .
i haven &#8217; t set a budget yet .
there are a lot of things i haven &#8217; t done yet .
i did , however , do the pre-wire myself .
the projector location is at 14 feet from the front wall .
i ran a conduit to the equipment location at the front of the room .
i had the electrician run a romex from the projector location to the equipment location also .
this allows me to use the romex as an &#8220; extension cord &#8221; of sorts that way i can plug the projector into a battery backup located at the equipment location .
here is a view of the front wall when seated .
i &#8217; m going to use a simple flat panel tv cabinet to hold the equipment .
i saw no reason to run the speaker wires to a wall box , so i will just run them on the floor .
here is a view from the kitchen .
i moved the cabinets out of view .
the subwoofer will be located near field with an option for a second sub on the front wall .
one inaccuracy of this drawing is the ceiling .
it is really vaulted with the low part on the left wall and high part on the right wall .
my wife and i are both musical and want to have a &#8220; live &#8221; room so all floors will be wood .
the piano and her harp will be in this room .
thoughts ?
comments ?
suggestions ?
there are a lot of things i would like to do , but money will be tight because we have to buy furniture and such .
unless i find a way to integrate a matching studio 20 center channel , i will likely be buying the studio cc - 690 center channel .
we watch very little tv .
it is mostly standard - def movies and tv shows .
i don &#8217; t have plans for blu - ray yet , but you never know .
the s - 1800 dvd player upscales to 1080p .
the house has been underway for the past 8 weeks , and they will be done mudding the sheetrock by the middle of next week , so i don &#8217; t have a lot of time .
