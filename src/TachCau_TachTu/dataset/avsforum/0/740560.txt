.
most of us know sony cancelled all future sxrd for rear projection ... so it appears now the only screen they are producing that is larger than 52 " costs over $ 30,000.00 .
it seems completely insane to me that they would cancel one technology if they did n't have something better coming to replace it .
does anyone know what this might be ?
or did sony actually deceided to completely get out of the > 52 " market ?
