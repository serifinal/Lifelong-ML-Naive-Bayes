confused about one thing ( audio related ) .
i use my ps3 for a bluray player , pretty common stuff , i have a samsung a750 120hz 1080p tv with no other audio system other than the one in the tv .
when watching movies i can perfectly hear truehd and dts - hd material .
and i 've confirmed i 'm playing those specific audio tracks on the ps3 .
i was told that only certain receivers can even use those formats , does the ps3 decode those internally ?
if i got a 5.1 receiver that does n't specifically say it decodes truehd and dts - hd ma , will i still be able to hear them because the ps3 ?
