th - 50pz85u blinking power light .
after doing some research i 've found some good info on the panny plasma blinking light syndrome , but just wanted to see if the same info applied to the 85u .
i bought a th - 50pz85u on august 2nd and just recently i 've gotten the " blinking light of death " twice .
both times i was getting 10 blinks .
the first time ( thursday night ) , i pulled the plug and the tv powered right back up .
the second time ( just now ) i had to unplug the hdmi cable , then the power cable .
after plugging the tv back in with hdmi disconnected , it fired right up and everything is working fine right now .
i called the concierge service and they would n't send anybody out unless the tv was not working when they showed up .
so i need to call back when it happens again .
this also did not happen until i started using hdmi cables this past monday .
all of my other viewing was with component cables .
i found this thread which outlines the blinking lights for the pz700u , but do these codes apply to the 85u also ?
also , could somebody explain in english what the 10 blinks means ?
thanks .
