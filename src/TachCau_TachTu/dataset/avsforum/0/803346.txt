force mpc hc avc ( dxva ) internal codec to not render l5 .1 .
hello , i 'm having an issue regarding playback of some older l5 .1 encoded 1080p mkv files .
apparently mpc hc now forces its avc codec to render l5 .1 encoded content since nvidia hardware can now decode it .
my system is 780g based and this is no good .
the video gets a lil sluggish and the audio goes out of sync .
to get around this i need to set coreavc as the preferred external filter , and then set it back after viewing .
ideally i 'd like to have the internal codec render all l4 .1 compliant material and ignore l5 .1 , leaving the next codec in priority to take over ( coreavc ) .
is this possible ?
does anyone know any other way around this issue ?
thanks
