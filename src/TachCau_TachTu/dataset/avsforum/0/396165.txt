what is the difference between the sony sr10 and the sr12 ? .
all i know is that the s10 is slightly smaller , has only 40 gb hdd and a 4megapixel still shots in comparison to the sr12 which is slightly larger , comes with 120 gb hdd and a 10megapixel still shots .
is there any other difference ?
anything in terms of picture quality ?
is the sr10 full 1920x1080 ?
or is it 1440x1080 ?
if they 're the same , i wish i went for the sr10 since it 's smaller , and 40 gb is more than enough for me , but none the less , my sr12 produced jaw dropping picture quality and sound on my 52 " bravia , which runs at 1080p since i run my videos using my ps3 .
thought on the differences ?
thanks !
edit : are there any sony cams that record in 1080p native ?
i remember somewhere on some tech blog that sony has one in the works ( if not released yet ) , thanks again !
