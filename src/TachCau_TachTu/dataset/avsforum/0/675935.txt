.
i recently bought a sony bdp - s300 blu - ray player .
i want to connect it to my yamaha htr - 5990 receiver and my pioneer pdp - 506pu plasma hdtv .
i currently am running an hdmi cable out from the blu ray hdmi out into the hdmi input on the back of the yamaha .
i then run an hdmi cable out from the yamaha hdmi out to the pioneer media reciever hdmi in ( it is one of the external ones vice being integrated into the back of the plasma screen ) .
with this set up i can hear the sound from the blu - ray fine but i get no picture .
the only way i can get a picture is to connect the component out video from the blu - ray to the pioneer media receiver .
when the best buy installer tried to connect the hdmi cables on a previous attempt he said there was some interface issue with the yamaha and the pioneer .
calling back to headquarters for each , the both of course said the other manufacturer was at fault and their components work fine .
any ideas as to how i can get all these devices to play along nicely ?
i would have the best buy guy come out but i am stationed in japan and it is a little tough .
thanks paul
