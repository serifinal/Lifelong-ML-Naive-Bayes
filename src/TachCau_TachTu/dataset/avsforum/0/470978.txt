.
i just replaced the color wheel on my samsung 46 " dlp .
i appear to be having the famous color shadowing issue that has become synonymous with this replacement .
i updated the cca values ( x , y ) based on the sticker that came with the new wheel , but there were also lv values that i was unable to locate in the service menu .
as a result the color and shadowing still looks bad .
attached is the sticker that i received .
