.
hey gang , this is my problem .
i have a yamaha rx - v661 receiver and it has two hdmi in ports in the back ( one marked dvd and the other dtv / cable ) .
i have my toshiba hdxa2 connected to the dvd port on the receiver .
i have been switching the cord back and forth between my ps3 to the hd player when watching movies because i can not get the ps3 to play when hooked into the dtv / cable port .
how can i set the receiver up to recognize the ps3 when connected to the dtv / cbl port ?
is it something on the tv i have to do ?
when i watch the hd player ( in the dvd port on receiver ) i have to press the source button on my tv remote to hdmi 1 to watch the dvd .
hdmi2 source is the cable / tv .
the third option when pressing the source button on my tv comes up as dtv / air .
i 'm not sure what i 'm missing here .
my tv is a samsung 56 " hd dlp t5676s if that helps .
i 'm just trying to avoid having to keep from moving the hdmi cord back and forth between the two players .
thanks guys !
i appreciate any assistance you can give .
