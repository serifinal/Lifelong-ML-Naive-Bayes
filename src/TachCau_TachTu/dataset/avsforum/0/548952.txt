ideas to consider -lrb- or steal -rrb- .
dear new readers - this thread is a mess .
the first hundred posts or so reflect my thought process after selling my old house w/ht and planning a ht in the new one .
i eventually scrapped these plans .
a bunch of ideas were kicked around , and an off topic landscaping project is being documented starting around post # 78 -lrb- plans -rrb- , then picking up again around post # 93 .
eventually , there will be a multipurpose room set up , but life has a few other cards that are first .
when the multi-purpose room starts i will re-write this post , and several others .
in the meantime , you can read my thought process and experiments , but not too much will be realized .
sorry for the mess .
regards , the management .
