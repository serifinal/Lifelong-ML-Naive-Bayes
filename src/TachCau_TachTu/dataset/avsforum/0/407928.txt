screen for mitsubishi 5500 .
either screen would have to be ordered , both are from screen innovations .
maybe there is something better for the money also ... 92 inch reference with lunar gray material ( .85 gain ) for $ 1200 or 110 inch zen with matte white material ( 1.0 gain ) for $ 400 .
could the quality of the reference be that much better to justify the $ 800 ?
i 'm sorry to say that i ca n't test either screen and that my knowledge on this stuff is limited .
i do appreciate any input !
