theater / game room build .
any comments / advice ? .
building a theater / game and wanted some advice etc. .
the room is approximately 23 ' wide x 28 ' long .
what do you guys think of these specs : screen : 119 " fixed da - lite cinema countour da - mat 16:9 1.3 gain projector : epson powerlite pro cinema 1080p ub 1600 lumens receiver : denon 3808 speakers : b&w in wall ( forgot the model numbers ) / 7.1 subwoofer : jl fathom 112 12 " all equipment will be on shelves in the back right ( facing the screen ) closet .
i am fairly new to this so i do n't know much .
am i in the right direction here in terms of the equipment compared to the size of the room ?
i was told the projector needs to be around 15.11 ' from the screen .
below are some plans .
there are no windows and the room is dedicated for game / theater .
any advice / comments would be appreciated .
thanks !
