th - 50px80u vs th - 50px80ua - does it matter ? .
i purchased two of these this month , from 2 different locations .
boxes look identical in every way except one has an " a " tacked onto the end of the sticker on the side , making it th - 50px80ua .
i assume there 's no difference or reason to choose one set over the other ?
or am i missing something ?
is there anything else i should look for as far as which to keep ( is a more recent manufacture date / serial number better or worse , etc ) ?
i know this is a popular set , was hoping someone may be in the know .
thanks .
