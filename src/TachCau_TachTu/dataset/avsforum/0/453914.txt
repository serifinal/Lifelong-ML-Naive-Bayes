the fun stuff ! .
introduction ... after a year and a half in my house , i 've finally started in my home theater and finally found the perfect name ... the dark knight theater it started out with just as just a cool name , but has slowly morphed into the theater 's theme .
i 'm putting the theater in my walkout basement , which has already been framed with 2x6 's .
the existing raw dimensions of the room are approximately 13 ' 6 " wide by 22 ' 6 " long by 10 ' high .
here is the basic floor plan : this is an ongoing project .

generally , you should avoid having the drivers point directly into the seating locations .
if you do , an 1 " of fiberglass board ( like oc703 ) can be placed in front of the sub 's driver .
these drivers create hf artifacts as a result of their operation .
these artifacts can lead to subwoofer localization ... something you want to avoid .
comb filtering : the audible impact of comb filtering is very unequal frequency response within critical frequency ranges .
the same sound from two different speakers will cross paths , and , when they do , you 'll have some frequencies cancelled ( 180 degrees out of phase ) and other frequencies augmented ( in phase ) plus all the variations in between .
these cancellations / augmentations will be inconsistent throughout the room .
isolation : reducing noise entering a space and reducing noise leaving that space to adjoining rooms is not mutually exclusive , nor did i say that .
my point is the real reason sound isolation should be employed in dedicated rooms is to reduce the noise floor in the room .
the fact those efforts assist in reducing noise levels outside the room should be considered a bonus .
there are some differences between the two efforts .
first , a significant cause of high noise floors in a room are a result of the noise brought into the room by the a / v installer or home owner ... the equipment .
other in room sources of noise include hvac noise .
the remainder is noise entering the room from the outside which needs to be eliminated .
second , if the sound track is at 75db in the room , and ambient noise levels outside the room are at 35db , you have a 40db problem to solve .
if the ambient noise in the room ( from outside sources ) is 35db , you have a 13db problem to solve .
do n't get excited ... that sounds easi er than it is and when we say ' noise floor ' the metric is either nc or nr which are weighted curves across a broad spectrum of frequencies .
the desired standard for noise transmission from inside a room to the adjoining spaces is the theater should not increase the ambient noise level outside the room by more than 3 db spl show me your ... : http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=978755 sound isolation : basic principles : http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showpost.php?p=4440751&postcount=5 http://www.greengluecompany.com/a-soundproofingtopic.php http://www.soundproofingcompany.com/index.php?/library/articles/elements_of_room_construction nc20 discussion : http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=14615232#post14615232 double 5/8 " drywall with green glue , stagger seams quasi staggered - stud construction for walls solid doors with weatherstripping and automatic thresholdshttp : / / www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1063385 http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=668073 http://www.greengluecompany.com/soundproofingdoors.php http://store.soundproofingcompany.com/product_p/automtic_door_bottom.htm http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=14988647 http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1096280 http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1050814 homemade plugs for windows rsic v clips for ceiling - http://www.soundproofingcompany.com/index.php?/products/clips/clips_installationwith 25 gauge resilient channel .

start with 1 layer on ceiling , then 1 layer on wall .

screws on first layer can be shorter than second layer .
generally most people seem to get a screw that will sink 1 " into stud .
that 's more than plenty . "
( 1-1/2 " for first layer , 2 " for second layer ) you only need screws that are 1/2 " longer than the thickness of the drywall if you are attaching it to 25 - gauge resilient channel .
( 1-1/4 " for first layer , 1-3/4 " for second layer ) .
do n't go too long or the screw may hit the wood , which would lower the efficiency of the clips and track .
