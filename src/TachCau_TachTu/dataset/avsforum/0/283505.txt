first impressions : can notice blacker blacks over 5010 .
it 's hard to tell were the bezel ends with the black bars .
initial start up is set to performance mode .
while in the menu .
very slight buzz when you put your head behind the set .
ca n't hear it in front at all .
have n't try tv or video yet but i will before i start break-in .
update regarding buzz : while running the break-in disc , i do hear a buzz which does change pitch from dark to light screens , light screens higher pitch , but i have to be 2 to 3 feet from the front to hear it and it 's the same as my 5010 .
my dvr box is louder then the buzz .
not the brightest backlite remote i 've seen .
it 's a little hard to see if the room is very dark .
i like the menus better then the 5010 .
i did n't care for the windows xp-ish menus in the 5010 .
it has a great tool menu that comes up from the bottom during viewing which you can change settings like picture mode and screen size .
here 's the post of the picture .
