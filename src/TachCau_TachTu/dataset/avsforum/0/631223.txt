problem with sewer cleanout - aka the devil pipe ! .
so i have have a problem i have been avoiding for a year or so . .
i have a sewer cleanout pipe in the middle of my concrete floor that is raised over .5 '' + and it is driving me nuts .
i call it a sewer cleanout , but i also have a normal looking one that y 's off the main pipe coming down the basement wall , so i am not 100 % sure what the correct term is for this pos pipe .
the cap is in there so tight , i can not get it off , and as you can see the cross in the top makes it hard to get anything in there to turn it .
i have spent hours scraping out hardened plumbers putty with a dental pick tool , but now all of it is gone , and it still will not budge !
i want some advice before i just start breaking concrete or trying to cut the lid out with a dremel because i imagine the stench that can result will probably give my wifes morning breath a run for her money ... top view : side view : the options i am thinking of so far are : - get a cross shaped key/tool made out of steel that will fit in there .
- cut the top off and try to find a rubber sealed cap i can slide in , then tighten to push out the rubber seal -lrb- if this exists -rrb- - get a hammer and a punch and break out the concrete enough to cut the pipe and try to glue on another that is slightly below grade -lrb- caps always stick up higher -rrb- .
- double layer of padding during the carpet phase and trim around the cap ?
anything else i am missing ?
