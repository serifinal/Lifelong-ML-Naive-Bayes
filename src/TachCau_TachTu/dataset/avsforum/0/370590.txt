samsung hl67a750 pc problem ... .
yesterday , i had my pc setup perfectly ... no " black " space around the top / bottom or left / right ... a perfect fit .
now i go to wake up this morning and now there 's at least 2 - 3 inches of black space around all sides .
no amount of resizing or settings on my graphics card and tv has been able to fix this yet .
i 've tried every suggestion i 've found on this forum , even setting the source name to pc and setting to wide pc ( which makes it worse ) has helped .
why was it fine last night ?
( perfect down to the mm ) and today it 's completely screwed up ?
any help would be greatly appreciated .
thanks !
