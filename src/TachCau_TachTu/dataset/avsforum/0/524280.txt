$ 40 diy yardstick frame masking system for pull - down screens .
it seems that masking solutions are primarily for fixed screens , but i have a 92 " , 16:9 pull - down screen , and gray bars on the 2.35:1 movies have always bothered me .
here 's an inexpensive , quick , lightweight solution for pulldown screens that i built yesterday .
it can easily be attached and removed by a single person using common office binder clips .
here 's what i used to build two 82 " x6 " masks : * ( 11 ) yardsticks - 1 1/16 " wide x 1/4 " thick .
i would recommend 3/8 " for larger screens .
* ( 1 ) bag of craft ( popsicle ) sticks * bottle of wood glue * velvet cut 6 " longer than the length of the mask * stapler * ( 4 ) large office binder clips * saw to cut the yardsticks and scissors to cut the velvet .
the yardsticks were $ 1.00 each , the velvet was $ 20.00 , and i already had the wood glue , craft sticks , and stapler .
cut the yardsticks as follows : * ( 8 ) full yardsticks plus ( 4 ) 10 " pieces to be used for the top and bottom rail of each mask .
* ( 8 ) 3 7/8 " pieces to be used as vertical supports .
glue the frames together using two craft sticks per joint .
trim craft sticks as necessary for best coverage for the vertical pieces .
glue extra craft sticks around the perimeter to attach the staples for the velvet .
the staples will poke through the front if attached directly to a 1/4 " thick yardstick .
after the glue has dried ( i waited about an hour , although overnight is better ) attach the velvet with the stapler .
the masks are attached with a single binder clip on each end and can be adjusted up or down to accommodate variances in image height .
