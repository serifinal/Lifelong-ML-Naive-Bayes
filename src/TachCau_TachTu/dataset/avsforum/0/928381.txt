" the bachelor pad " ... ht build .
i was trying to come up with a clever name for my thread and thought since i am single and live alone , i may as well just call it the bachelor pad for the sake of this thread anyway .
my room will double as a ht and a screening room to view music videos and other project i produce and shoot .
now i am turning an already existing room into a dedicated theater so its not going to be as elaborate as many of your great theater rooms i see on here .
i should have started this thread a while back but oh well .
i will post some pics and info to catch everyone up .
first 3 pics are before anything was done in the room .
the stand used to hold the 42 " flat screen .
hired an electrician to come out and install 4 sconces , whole house surge protector and run my panamax power pro outlets and run romex in between both outlets below you can see the panamax outlet for the projector .
i have built a shelf on the back wall because i have small " i " beams in the ceiling that was n't big enough to attach a mount to .
i do have the chief rpa - universal though .
the other plate on the wall is a single gang cable outlet where i will run my cables from the pj through the wall .
i covered the sconces so i could do the patchwork to the 12 holes the electrician put in my walls and ceiling .
yesterday i painted the ceiling a bluish gray color called " skipper " from behr .
flat of course and 2 coats .
oh yea the whole room was primed white before any painted began .
that is where i am as of today .
i plan to paint the screen wall tomorrow followed by the other 3 walls this weekend .
