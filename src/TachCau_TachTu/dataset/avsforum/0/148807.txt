.
my parents currently have a sharp lc37d64u out at their cottage .
they purchased a wall mount with it which the sales person assured them that it would fit .
the mount did n't fit .
so my parents have a couple options .
1 -rrb- keep their current tv and get the right moun for an extra $ 400 .
-lrb- they are n't a fan of this one -rrb- 2 -rrb- the store is willing to exchange their tv for a samsung ln40a550 -lrb- which will fit the mount they bought -rrb- .
3 -rrb- return their tv and get the sharp lc37d44u -lrb- 720p instead of 1080p -rrb- and get some money back .
they asked me what i thought , and i 'm not up to snuff about which models are better than others .
is the samsung tv a step up or down other than the obvious 3 inches of increased size ?
what would you do if you were me ?
what advice should i give ?
thanks !
