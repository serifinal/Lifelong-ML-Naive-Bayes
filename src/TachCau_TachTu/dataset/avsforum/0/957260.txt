samsung ln52a650 w / marantz sr5002 .
hello .
i posted this question in the hdtv technical forum , and someone replied saying i should post the question in this forum rather than hdtv technical ... so here goes ( sorry for the re-posting of the same question , i could n't figure out how to delete the other thread ) : i recently purchased the samsung ln52a650 and a marantz sr5002 av receiver .
i 've hooked everything up , running an hdmi from my xbox to the receiver and the cable box to the receiver .
everything is hdmi .
i get video on both the tv and the xbox , but no audio .
the marantz controls are pretty different from other receivers i 've owned in the past , and i ca n't seem to find why my audio is n't working from the tv or the receiver when i have it running that setup .
if anyone can tell me what i 've done wrong .
perhaps there 's a setting that i need to enable , or maybe this receiver just wo n't work for my setup ?
thanks in advance for any help !
