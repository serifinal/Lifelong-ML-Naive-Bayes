has anyone ever decoupled soffits ? .
hi , i 've been lurking on these boards for 1.5 years now .
i appreciate everyone 's input and and documentation of their theaters .
it 's time for me to get involved now ( both asking questions and helping others out with any insight i can provide from my experiences ) .
now for my question ( after some backgorund ) .
due to existing hvac ducts and plumbing , i will not be able to easily create a sealed box and add soffits within .
would it be better / easier / cheaper to frame the soffits to the existing framework and then decouple the drywall with rsic - v , or somehow try and decouple the soffit framework with rsic hangers , and attach the drywall directly to the soffit framework ?
thanks , matt
