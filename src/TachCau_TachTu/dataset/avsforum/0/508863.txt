help with onkyo 606 audio .
hi all i have recently purchased an onkyo606 - it is my first receiver and i am quite new to this type of thing .
in general , i am happy , but could do with some advice on the different sound settings .
at the moment , i have a htpc , sky + ( nothd ) and standard dvd player .
all are connected using digital audio cables .
at the moment all is set on auto and for dvd?s this is fine as it sets to dd or dts depending on the source .
what i need advice on is the recommended for standard tv .
at the moment , i usually use all ch stereo and occasionally dolby pro logic ii for movies .
both are good , although voice is sometimes a bit quiet - i need to ramp up the volume a bit .
i am also finding that when i view a sky program that is supposed to be in dolby digital , the receiver is not detecting this - all the usual checks have been done , using optical cable & sky box output set to dolby digital .
could also do with some suggestions on the sub set up .
done the audessy thing , but have input , crossover and phase dials on the sub itself , not sure exactly what each of them do .
any advice gratefully received .
many thanks in advance !!
