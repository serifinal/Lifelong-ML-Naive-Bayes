newbie dsp update request for help . .
important : please note , that i no longer have access to the firmware files of the older onkyo avrs .
those download links have expired also , because most of them were not used for more than a month and thus their contents have been deleted .
sorry !
... for the onkyo xx5 / xx6 and / integra x. 8 / x. 9 model series .
ok , here they are ... ... expanded and updated once in a while remember : i found those links on the internet just by doing some ( intelligent ) searching and pure luck ( as always ) .
i am not in any way responsible for the contents those publicly available links point to .
i am just a scout i do not have or host those files myself , so please do n't pm me about it .
unfortunately i wo n't be able to help , if they are no longer available .
note : there is always a risk to be considered and evaluated , that something might ( and eventually will ) go wrong during a software / firmware update .
think twice , if you will take the risk off doing it on your own instead of taking it to an onkyo / integra service point .
by downloading any files listed here you accept and declare explicitly , that you accept the responsibility for your action .
if you have any questions regarding the functionality of your onkyo avr ( xx5 ) there is a very complete listing in the 1st post of this thread ============= > 705 thread faq 1st post although it was originally directed towards the 705 it has a lot more to present now , providing answers in terms of general advice , like help for lip sync issues , audyssey setup and common user mistakes to be avoided .
do n't miss it !

update yourself using a flash writer ( jig ) or dongle : if you are one of the unlucky " early adopters " or a member of the so - calles " sol " club , who have the infamous loader version 1.00 , do n't despair , you will now be able to update yourself using on of those privately made flash writers or dongles for the onkyo 805 / 705/605 and integras .
check the other onkyo / integra firmware thread and add yourself to one of those ( regional ) lists ( even europe and other continents / countries ) .
note about dongle usage : >> " thus , i am reemphasizing about dongle usage in this upgrade .
make sure the marking &#8220; --- > up &#8221; or pin &#8220; 1 &#8221; is in up direction with a magnifier visual inspect the connection between dongle contact and onkyo connector , i realize this is somehow awkward to try , but it makes it more robust .
as i explained this many times , dongle pcb is cut by a scissor and me ; not by a machine , so there are chances that dongle &#8217; s front tip might be smaller or bigger than the actual onkyo connector width .
if bigger it won &#8217; t go in ( do not force it , you may bend the onkyo connector , bad news ) .
just shave it with a nail filer .
if it &#8217; s smaller then try to shift it up or down to make the contact . "

i think it does a better job with 480i input than 480p sources .
the edge enhancement does a really good job , it does not introduce much ringing but if there is ringing present in the input source , it will of course worsen it .
i have found that " picture mode : auto " works best for my sources .
i am including the doc for the video adjustments .
1 - 1 .
monitor out monitor out : use to choose which type of monitor output is being used ( analog / hdmi main / hdmi sub ) .
the following parameters are memorized for each monitor out : resolution : * through output resolution is the same resolution of input signal .
* auto output resolution is the highest resolution that tv corresponds that it can handle .
( " auto " only available for hdmi monitor out . )
* 480p / 720p / 1080i / 1080p output resolution is the specified resolution .
( 1080p is only available for hdmi monitor out . )
* source output resolution is the specified resolution in picture adjust .
( you can specify an individual resolution of each source . )
( the following parameters are added to or subtracted from adjustments made for each input in " 4 - 4 picture adjust " menu . )
example : " 1 - 1 monitor out " brightness is set to ( +5 ) , " 4 - 4 picture adjust " brightness is set to ( - 5 ) , monitor output brightness will be ( 0 ) .
brightness : -50 to +50 ( changes by about 1 [ rgb 0 - 255 ] in 1 step increments . )
contrast : -50 to +50 ( changes by 0.8 % in 1 step increments . )
hue : -50 to +50 ( changes by 1 degree in 1 step increments . )
saturation : -50 to +50 r brightness : -50 to +50 ( changes by about 1 [ rgb 0 - 255 ] in 2 step increments . )
r contrast : -50 to +50 ( changes by 0.4 % in 1 step increments . )
g brightness : -50 to +50 ( changes by about 1 [ rgb 0 - 255 ] in 2 step increments . )
g contrast : -50 to +50 ( changes by 0.4 % in 1 step increments . )
b brightness : -50 to +50 ( changes by about 1 [ rgb 0 - 255 ] in 2 step increments . )
b contrast : -50 to +50 ( changes by 0.4 % in 1 step increments . )
4 - 4 .
picture adjust these parameters are memorized for each source : game mode : on , off ( if set to " on " , video processor latency is lowered .
however , some parameters such as edge enhancement , mosquito nr are not available . )
zoom mode : normal , full , zoom , or wide zoom .
isf mode : custom , day or night .
( default gamma for " day mode " is between 1.8 and 1.9 , default gamma for " night mode " is between 2.2 and 2.4 ) the following parameters are memorized for each isf mode : ( to make changes to the following parameters : push and hold the " display " button on the remote control for 8 seconds .
if you exit the setup menu or return to " 4 .
source setup " the parameters of isf mode " day " or " night " are locked again . )
resolution : through / auto / 480p / 720p / 1080i / 1080p ( when you choose " source " in 1 - 1 .
monitor out - > resolution , this parameter is effective . )
brightness : -50 to +50 ( changes by about 1 [ rgb 0 - 255 ] in 1 step increments . )
contrast : -50 to +50 ( changes by 0.8 % in 1 step increments . )
hue : -50 to +50 ( changes by 1 degree in 1 step increments . )
saturation : -50 to +50 picture mode : auto / video / film ( auto - automatically detect and process accordingly , video - 20 fps , film - 24 fps .
picture mode function will not work if the source component ( dvd player , etc. ) is outputting progressive scan video . )
edge enhancement : off / low / mid / high ( use to make the picture appear sharper .
edge enhancement function has no affect when the video resolution is down - converted , for example from 1080p to 720p . )
mosquito nr : off / low / mid / high ( use to remove shimmering or hazziness that sometimes appears around objects in the picture .
can be issue w / overly compressed mpeg content . )
random nr : off / low / mid / high ( use to remove indescriminate picture noise such as film grain . )
block nr : off / on ( use to remove block distortion that can sometimes appear in the picture .
can be an issue w / overly compressed mpeg content . )
( the nr ( noise reduction ) functions support all video input signals up to 480p / 576p . )
gamma : -3 to +3 example : if gamma of your monitor is 2.2 , -3 : total gamma is 1.6 .
0 : total gamma is 2.2 .
+3 : total gamma is 2.8 .
r brightness : -50 to +50 ( changes by about 1 [ rgb 0 - 255 ] in 2 step increments . )
r contrast : -50 to +50 ( changes by 0.4 % in 1 step increments . )
g brightness : -50 to +50 ( changes by about 1 [ rgb 0 - 255 ] in 2 step increments . )
g contrast : -50 to +50 ( changes by 0.4 % in 1 step increments . )
b brightness : -50 to +50 ( changes by about 1 [ rgb 0 - 255 ] in 2 step increments . )
b contrast : -50 to +50 ( changes by 0.4 % in 1 step increments . )
other blue mode ( blue only filter ) : if blue mode is on , r and g of output signal become 0 .
( to turn blue mode on / off : from the front panel - push and hold " hdmi out " then push " memory " . )
itu conversion ( sd - > hd ) press down " hdmi out " and " rt / pty / tp " button ( dimmer for us model ) to bring up itu conversion ( sd - > hd ) on press " rt / pty / tp " to toggle on / off .
some cautious notes ( and legal stuff ) : do not contact me , if those links do n't work ( anymore ) .
i do n't take responsibility for them or their contents , i am just a scout as always : read the instructions first .
update path : onkyo / integra instructions state , that the 1.08 / 1.07 / 1.09 upgrade / update should only be done , if you got min .
1.05 / 1.04 on your unit preinstalled .
but as has been mentioned by several users , the update worked fine from 1.01 upwards ( beware of 1.00 so ) .
the prerequisite is , that the displayed loader version " main update " must be at least ver .1.01 / 07615l ( xx6 do n't have this anymore , so do n't worry ) just to be on the safe side , check your loader version beforehand by entering main update mode ( leave it without doing anything by switching the unit off , if you want to ) .
905/8 .8 : if below 1.05 goto 1.05 first , then 1.08 / 1.09 .
875/9 .8 / 885 : if below 1.04 goto 1.04 first , then 1.07 / 1.08 .
805/7 .8 : if below 1.04 goto 1.04 first , then 1.08 .
note : the stated versions refer to the * main " firmware version not the " loader " version , which always must be at least 1.01 / 07615l .
do n't mix up those important differences .
there are reports , that direct updates from older versions did work , others reported some problems and reverted back to the recommended procedure .
there is a lot of evidence ( verified by now ) , that older 905 / 875/805 units with firmware / loader < 1.01 ca n't be updated this way .
so beware , or you might " brick " ( make it non-functional ) your unit !
if in doubt , check with your nearest onkyo / integra service point .
check your existing main firmware version : = > turn on your unit , push & hold " display " , press " standby " , release buttons = > to see additional firmware infos ( dsps etc ) press button underneath " tone " repeatedly ( do n't wait to long ) onkyo / integra have told us , that these updates should not be installed if your current firmware to start with for 905 / 8.8 is below 1.05 or 875 / 9.8 / 885 is below 1.04 ( same seems to hold true for the 805/7 .8 ) .
many users have used these updates on older firmware versions too without any problems .
if you got an earlier version to start with , there might be additional steps to be taken ( dsp : hardware modification + hdmi+net : additional firmware ) !
if this is the case , and you need them , contact your nearest onkyo / integra service point for the complete update procedure .
i told you so ... check your existing loader version : note : onkyo xx6 and integra x. 9 units do n't have a visible loader version anymore .
updating the main firmware can be done by anyone by going through the rs232 port provided as long as the installed loader version is 1.01 / 07615l or above .
to check , what loader version your unit has installed please follow this procedure : - disconnect / unplug your unit .
- whilst holding down the enter key re-insert mains plug .
- your unit should switch to main update mode , displaying the current loader version installed .
- release enter key .
or - disconnect / unplug your unit .
- whilst holding down the tuning up key re-insert mains plug .
- your unit should switch to main update mode , displaying the current loader version installed .
- release tuning up key .
only for xx5 and x. 8 units : if your loader version is 1.01 / 07615l or above you may continue with the update procedure .
if not , please exit update mode by pressing standby .
note : if your loader version shows 1.00 please exit without doing anything by pressing standby .
if you do n't you will be sorry if you continue with the update procedure , because your unit will become non-functional while doing this .
so ... beware !
it is suggested , that those updates are universal for the western hemisphere .
i ca n't verify this ... anyway , version ids are identical .
if in doubt , check with your nearest onkyo / integra service point .
note : to verify the installations numerous users have installed and tested them and those updates worked just fine ( to my knowledge ) .
installation procedures : the updates consists of ... a ) dsp firmware update ... b ) main firmware update there are two update paths for these updates : - dsp firmware update : the firmware resides inside a .
wav file ( ! )
, which needs to be burned onto an audio cd and played back through a cd / dvd - player connected by an optical link ( toslink ) to opt1 .
there must be a one - to - one copy of the file and it must be transfered unmodified .
most older cd / dvd player will work just fine .
read the corresponding threads .
- main firmware update : the update routine uses a rs232 connection to the rear of the unit .
the rs232 cable must be of type straight through ( no crossover ) with a male and female connector at the end .
you need a pc with a com1 port ( default ) or a usb = > rs232 converter for this , as described elsewhere .
the update procedure is been initiated through a supplied setup software , which handles everything .
integra : the update instructions differ somewhat for the integras ( excerpt ) ii ) procedure for upgrading main fw on the unit : connect the rs232 port of your pc to the receiver ( unplugged ) rs232 port by using a rs232 straight cable .
keep unit unplugged .
press tuning up button and in this condition you should plug the receiver in the ac outlet .
you will see on the display &#8220; main update mode &#8221; .
after this follow these steps .
a ) open &#8220; app_updater_xxx &#8221; folder and double click on &#8220; update.exe &#8221; .
you will see following gui .
b ) check the com port .
it should be same as the rs232 port of your pc connected to your receiver ( usually com1 ) .
c ) click on &#8220; main update &#8221; button beware : anyone with an " audyssey pro " installation : the original update routine by onkyo / integra of the " dsp " firmware is at fault , not the update firmware itself , deleting all your ( costly ) " audyssey pro " settings .
be prepared therefore , to call in the audyssey installer again afterwards !
i told you so ... this holds true for the " normal " audyssey parameters too .
your personal settings will be erradicated running the update routine of the " dsp " .
... and you will not have the opportunity to save anything .
a hardware reset is recommended strongly in any case to get the new firmware properly initialized .
audyssey should also be rerun after the update , because some things might have changed .
note : audyssey has stated in the meantime , that nothing has changed in this firmware release with respect to the audyssey implementation ( but one never knows ... onkyo might have done something ) hardware reset : the av receiver contains a microcomputer for signal processing and control functions .
in very rare situations , software " bugs " , severe interference , noise from an external source or static electricity may cause it to lockup .
in the unlikely event that this happens , unplug the power cord from the wall outlet , wait at least 5 seconds , and then plug it back in again .
note : this might take care of some strange behavior of your unit , like malfunctioning of the muting .
initialisation ( " clear " ) : to reset the av receiver to its factory defaults , turn it on and , while holding down the [ vcr / dvr ] button , press the [ standby / on ] button .
&#8220; clear &#8221; will appear on the display and the av receiver will enter standby mode .
all personal / individual setting will be cleared and replaced by factory default setting .
note : this will make you lose all your individual settings .
onkyo / integra has indicated , that the following method saves settings " permanently " ( not on the " dsp " update ) .
note : it has been reported , that saving your settings , will not survive the dsp firmware update procedure !
be prepared to redo everything .
so write down your setting before updating the unit !
note : update 1.09 contains a form ( pdf ) just for this .
1 ) to store settings ( must be done first , otherwise the recall will not have anything to recall ) : turn the unit on .
from the front panel - push and hold " setup " , then push " enter " .
the unit will display " setup store ? "
, still holding " setup " push " enter " again and the unit will display " setup storing " , then it will display " complete " and thus the procedure is complete .
i would advice anyone to do this after a successfull setup / audysseys calibration , to preserve this for a later recall .
2 ) to recall settings : turn the unit on .
from the front panel - push and hold " setup " , then push " return " .
the unit will display " setup recall ? "
, still holding " setup " push " return " again and the unit will display " setup recalling " , then it will display " complete " and thus the procedure is complete .
color space switching : note : originally posted by rickardl .
discovered on a 876 .
not sure if this has been mentioned here ... on the front panel , press down " hdmi out " and " rt / pty / tp " button ( dimmer for us model ) to bring up itu conversion ( sd - > hd ) on press " rt / pty / tp " to toggle on / off .
the " infamous " eeprom error : several users , who did n't follow the recommended update path = > 1.05 / 1.04 ( depending on model ) then to the newest , got that infamous eeprom / e2prom error ( others might have , too ) .
different solutions where suggested from user experience for this issue : a ) go back to main firmware 1.05 / 1.04 and then go to the latest 1.09 / 1.08 ( onkyo / integra recommended update sequence ) .
b ) reflash / rewrite ( retry ) with the same firmware version up to three times , before giving up .
c ) do a hardware reset , then a software reset ( " clear " ) as described in the manula , afterwords a ( not in the manual ) " store settings " as described in this post .
if all this did n't help , you probably should see your regional onkyo / integra service point for a cure .
i found an interesting post in another thread here , which might get rid of this problem , which many have experienced : note : others having the same problem had to get one of the chips exchanged due to hardware failure / defective chip .
quote : michael carey how i cured my e2prom error problem hi everybody , i posted this in the integra dtr - 8.8 thread , but i thought i would add it here as well .
i 've spend the last 24 hours testing various firmware update procedures and i think i found a cure for the power failure e2prom error message on my dtr - 8.8 .
i 'm not sure if this will work with other integra / onkyo models , i hope others out there can try this out and report back .
after the main unit firmware update , you get a complete message on the display , then clear appears and then the unit goes into standby .
i found that this does n't completely clear the receiver , i found that network settings & internet radio stations remain intact after a firmware update ... so the next thing to do is a full factory reset by pressing and holding the " vcr / dvr " button on the front panel down and then pressing the " standby / on " button .
this clears everything !
now , before you get too carried away with getting all your settings back to how you like them ... do this .
on the front panel , press and hold the " setup " button and press the " enter " button . "
setup store ? "
will appear on the display .
while still holding down the " setup " button , press the " enter " button again .
you will then see " setup storing " on the display .
i found this was the magical step that made the dreaded e2prom error go away .
until i completed the setup store , virtually every time i pulled the plug on the receiver , i would get an e2prom error message upon restoration of power and my settings would vanish .
i found this only needed to be done once , right after the full factory reset .
even after changing settings on the receiver , it would still remember what i had changed , even if i did n't do the " setup store ? "
procedure afterwards .
my theory is that the " setup store " somehow formats the e2prom memory to the requirements of the newly flashed firmware .
i would be very interested to see if others plagued with the e2prom error message has any luck with the above procedure .
color space bug it has been mentioned ( and measured ) by several users , that there is an issue with the way onlyo / integra have implemented the reon vx hqv - used in the 875 / 905 models - leading in some situations to mapping errors in the color values displayed .
here are two links to the resulting mapping errors to be expected in these cases : color space bug examples 1 color space bug examples 2 remember : if you are unsure , what all those infos or technical details mean or what you are doing ... do n't do it !

<< bump this one up , if you use the downloads or profit from this thread , so others may find it without searching ps. : just added some pictures about a cooling solution for the 905 , which should work on other units as well ( dscfxxxx_800.jpg ) .
this one allows placement of other units on top of the 905 and hides underneath those units ( fans : http://www.buy.com/retail/product.as...48527&ref=lmcd ) !
my favorite fans ( 120 mm ) are the noiseblocker m12 - s1 units .
8dba @ 750 rpm @ 12 vdc .
inaudible even listening closely .
noise level is certified by the german t?v institute . .
