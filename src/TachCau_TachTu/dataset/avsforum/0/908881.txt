i 'm getting ready to hook up a new a / v system and i 've got a few questions about how to get the best signal quality and which type of connectors i should use .
first , generally what is the correct order for the best signal of the following ?
hdmi , optical , component , composite , s video , digital coaxial , & cable connector .
in other words , which should i use primarily , secondarily , etc. .
also , does optical only support sound signals and not video signals ?
