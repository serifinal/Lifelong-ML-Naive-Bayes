xbox 360 no hdmi - does it matter much ! .
i will be installing my home theater with 50 '' pioneer plasma - pioneer elite vsx92 receiver , mythos 8 speakers -lrb- l , r , c -rrb- in ceiling rears , supercube ii sub .
i have the first version xbox 360 with no hdmi .
will the games still look great or will the hdmi version make it that much better .
my options then would be to get rid of the 360 to get a new one .
or get ps3 as a game console as i do not like it for blue ray -lrb- audio wise -rrb- .
any tips suggestions .
thanks ,
