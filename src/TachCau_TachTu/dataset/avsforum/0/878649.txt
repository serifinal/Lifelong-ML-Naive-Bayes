painted faux starry sky ceiling .
i 've read the various posts of the fiber optic starry ceilings , but am quickly running out of budget for my home theatre .
( saving the rest for good speakers ) have any others painted a faux starry night ceiling in their tray ceiling , using glow in dark paint for the stars ?
i know this will not be as good as the fiber optics solution , but trying to find a similar solution with paint for my 10 ft. x 10 ft. ceiling area ... thanks in advance for any other examples , and what color you used to make the night sky ?
( black ?
or dark blue ? )
i will be lighting using a rope light inside of the crown molding ... thanks in advance -
