official samsung lnxxa550 ( series 5 ) owners thread no price talk ! .
these are available now .
samsung series 5 lcd ( 2008 ) hdtvs model numbers : * ln32a550p - 32 - inch * ln37a550p - 37 - inch * ln40a550p - 40 - inch * ln46a550p - 46 - inch * ln52a550p - 52 - inch ( the above links go to samsung 's support pages which includes manuals and quick start guides for each ) .
something i would like to point out is that the 32 " and 37 " models have worse technical specs than the 40 " , 46 " , and 52 " .
a 15,000:1 contrast ratio compared to a 30,000:1 contrast ratio ( and possibly other differences ) .
so even though they are in the same 550 series they are not all the same !
