this will be my second major home theater build .
the first was a dedicated room in our palm springs , ca home .
the outcome was fairly successful for our purposes .
i have included a link to my website that has pictures of the construction process here .
my second home theater was the conversion of the 2nd bedroom in our apartment .
being an apartment , nothing permanent could be done , and this room was also used for other purposes .
the only construction was for the purpose of mounting of small , motorized 84 " diagonal 16:9 projection screen .
although we enjoyed the small bedroom theater immensely , it doesn &#8217; t really qualify as a home theater &#8220; build .
&#8221; this brings us up to present day .
my wife and i just purchased a new townhome with a full , unfinished basement , pictured here .
as you can see , the basement has its challenges with the location of the hvac , plumbing and support beam .
however , thanks to many of the wonderful suggestions of fellow avsers , i have settled in on a design for the new theater .
in designing the theater area , it was important that the basement maintain an &#8220; open &#8221; feel to it for entertaining .
one of the challenges that i still face are the water lines running everywhere .
it is important that the equipment rack and projector not be located right below water / sewer lines that may start to leak some day .
i have not yet determined where the equipment room will be located .
we also would like to add a bar somewhere into the mix .
here is the initial design that i have come up with : i currently already have much of the a / v equipment for the theater .
i may do some swapping out of individual components , but for the most part the equipment listed above is what i will be using .
the following issues are still to be determined and any input is greatly appreciated : where to put the equipment room &#8211; i would ultimately like to have enough room for two racks , in the event that i do a distributed audio / video system throughout the entire home .
storage location for dvds and cds &#8211; one thought was to locate all the software in the equipment room .
bar location the time frame for this project completion no later than december 2009 .
