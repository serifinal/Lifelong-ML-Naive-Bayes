paradigm monitor v5 vs studio v4 only for ht .
hi , i have some questions regarding the difference between paradigm monitor v5 and studio v4 .
i have the following speakers at front : - paradigm monitor 11 v5 - paradigm centrer cc - 390 v5 now , my questions : 1 ) will i see a big difference in sound if i traded them for studio 60 ( v3 or v4 ) and cc - 570v3 ( or cc - 590v4 ) 2 ) if i decide only to change my center for a cc - 570 ( or cc - 590 ) does the timbre matching between speakers will still be good ?
please note that i 'm only using those speakers for home theater , not to listen music .
thanks in advance .
ben ps .
