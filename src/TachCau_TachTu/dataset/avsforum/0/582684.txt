corey lane cinema bar - lswho 's theatre bar .
welcome to the copper pub ... the still ongoing , still transforming , ever changing home pub build thread .
pull up a chair , have a drink and swap stories , ideas , complaints , & designs with us .
well this is way overdue so i am finally starting my first thread after countless years and hours at a time of viewing and sitting behind the scenes .
i first want to thank a few threads that really helped me without really knowing it , some gave me construction ideas , what not to do 's , what products they used and most importantly a place to get ideas and pictures .
a quick shout out to heynow ^ 's , chinadog , big e 's , dinger23 and many i ca n't remember off the top of my head .
thanks to all of you i think i have created a space my family enjoys ( although not 100 % completed yet ) and proud i 've done it all myself .
i plan on adding numerous pic 's in the near future of the build , past - present - future .
any questions do n't hestiate to ask .
