trying to build first htpc , help me please .
hey there , first time htpc guy looking to build an afforable , but beastly , machine .
here 's what i 'm looking to do : - archive my dvds in relatively good quality and be able to playback from hd .
i do n't have a ton right now but want a decent amount of storage to help keep options open .
- eventually be able to archive bluray and playback from hd .
- store music on machine , allow for playback .
- store pictures on machine .
- maybe use as dvr ( i have comcast ) - simple , but excellent user interface .
must be relatively easy for even techno - phobic middle - agers to use .
- i have a samsung lcd hdtv and a 100 " projector screen that drops down in front of it .
would like to be able to display on both screens ( not at once , just have the capability to watch tv or projector ) .
recommendations ?
looking to stay reasonably cheap here .
