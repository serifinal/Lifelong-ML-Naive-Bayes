can sony bdp - s350 support hdmi and component outputs at same time like the s300 ? .
i upgraded from the bdp - s300 ( loaner from dealer ) to bdp - s350 and seem to have lost the ability to get component video and hdmi at the same time .
i 'm using this to feed two different tvs in different zones of an integra receiver .
anyone know if this is something i need to configure or if it 's a function that went away in the new player ?
