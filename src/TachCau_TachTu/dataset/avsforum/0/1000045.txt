dealer offering me a demo rs11 vs marantz vp - 15s1 ... i have 12 hours to decide ! .
i just got an intersting call from the dealr offering me thier demo room runco rs1100 vs the marantz vp - 15s1 i did a lot of home work to decide on the marantz and really did not consider the runco during the process .
since he threw this option into the miz i wanted to ask the experts ( * ar n't we all :-) ) here should i stay with my initial decision or given he is offering a projector which only has a few hours on it and is about 5k more than the marantz , that the runco rs110 ( not ultra ) , is the better deal help as i need to make a decision tonight if i am going to meet the install date i need thanks in advance !
