brodie home theatre - build thread .
hi folks , i 'm in the beginning stages of planning my basement ht .
i have an unfinished basement , with typical basement issues - 8 ' ceilings , ducts to deal with etc. .
the window in the planned ht room is a 2 ' x 4 ' window that will be treated with window coverings - so i expect to be in the " bat cave " scenario .
only the exterior walls , and the wall around the stair case are studded currently .
the interior partition walls are just my design at this point .
the dimensions of the ht section of the room are roughly 15 ' x 15 ' .
the sofa is placed about 12 ' from the screen .
i do n't currently own any components of the setup .
i plan this ht to be more casual than some i see here , but i am picky about image and audio quality .
comments and helpful criticism welcome on the design .
some questions ( i 'm looking for ideas so that when i move to studding the walls , i can place the wiring in right areas ) : - is it ideal to place the center speaker behind the screen ?
it would seem so .
- one sub or two ?
- what is the " correct " height / placement for the side and rear speakers ?
- i plan to have lots of conduit , so i can pull wires latetly , but in the ceiling i plan to make so i can place projector whereever i choose after the room is finished .
hopefully my plan uploads with this post .
thanks looking .
