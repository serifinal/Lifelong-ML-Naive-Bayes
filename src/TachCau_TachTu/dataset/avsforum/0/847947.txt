official samsung lnxxa850 owner 's thread .
i know there was another thread about the a850 , but i did n't see an " official owner 's thread " so i thought i 'd go ahead and start it .
maybe the two threads can be merged .
i just brought home a ln52a850 this evening .
i 've not had a chance to mess with the settings or calibrations , but i thought this would be a good place for owners to start posting settings and tweaks .
i will get some pics up as soon as possible .
i 'll also give my impressions of this tv and try to review it as best as possible .
this tv was replacing an older model sony rpt and i also have a 40xbr2 for comparison sake .
