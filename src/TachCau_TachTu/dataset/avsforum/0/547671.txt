.
available also in hd dvd combo ok before moving on let us forget any comparison in pq against beowulf or ratatouille for the moment .
we have to give this disc a chance i got the disc a week ago and quickly pop it in my pc for a quick pq evaluation .
big mistake watching this about two feet away from my dell2408wfp the first thing that i noticed is the minor aliasing happening in the picture .
not to mention some banding in the background and also in some closeup shots some artifacting and blocking during fast motion ( did i mention this is an action anime ? )
especially when deunan and brialeos are in notre dame .
overall the pq lacks that 3d look and its soft , soft , soft i really want to enjoy this movie so later that day i tried watching this on my 1080p epson pj at 120 " ( btw all my viewing sets are spyder calibrated ) and although the issues are less noticeable its still distracting to me .
maybe using my 720p pj will suffice ?
its still there .
i 'm finally satisfied when i hook it up to my samsung 40 " lcd overall an upgrade in pq over dvd but in some scenes just marginally .
this is a botched transfer .
every cgi based animation i have seen is almost perfect , detailed and sharp .
very 3d looking .
there is no reason that this transfer is not going to look like the others .
the movie file size is 15.60 gb vc - 1 .
overall the files occupy 24 gb of the disc .
even if they raise the bit rate on this most of the pq issues are entirely to be blamed on the transfer .
this will retail low enough to be a blind buy .
the movie itself is satisfactory for anime fans ( imho ) and casual buyers that wants to see cgi animation with lots of action , mechs , babes and sci - fi stuff .
this would have been a demo material in terms of pq .
this initial release is mediocre .
hoping for a remaster in the future .
