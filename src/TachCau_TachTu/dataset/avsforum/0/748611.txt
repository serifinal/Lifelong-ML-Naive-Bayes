do rear and side surround speakers have to be at the same height ? .
i have a 7.2 speaker system in my theater .
i 'm using paradigm adp - 470 's for the side and rear surround speakers .
the rear speakers may be a little low for seat and head clearance .
so , i was wondering if i raise the rear speakers will it cause any issues with the sound in the room ?
currently the four surround speakers ( two sides and two rears ) are all at the same height .
if i can get away with raising just the two rear speakers that would save me some work .
if i have to raise them all to the same height then that 's what i have to do .
let me know what you think .
