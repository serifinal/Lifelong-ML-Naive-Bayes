d300 printing problems .
hi , i have a canon d300 and when printing the photos appear a lot darker than they appear on the laptop/camera screen .
i have put my cf card into a sony camera and took the same picture which printed out fine i then put the sony cf card -lrb- same make -rrb- into my canon and this too printed out fine , so i assume my camera and the cf card are ok .
it 's just they do not seem to work together , is this possible and should i buy another card ?
any tips would be most appreciated thanking you in advance steve
