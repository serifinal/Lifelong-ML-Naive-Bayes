canon powershot sx20is uv filter .
could n't find the uv filter size anywhere in the manual on cd or on the specs on the canon site .
took the camera to camera store to test the size -lrb- looked like it was 58mm -rrb- .
however , there are n't any threads to attach .
what gives ?
anyone else experience this ?
when did not buying and attaching uv filters to new camera lenses fall by the wayside .
this is my first canon digital slr camera ; i 've always had nikons before but liked the reviews on the sx20is and was looking for something more portable and versatile than my full-blown nikon d70 slr .
