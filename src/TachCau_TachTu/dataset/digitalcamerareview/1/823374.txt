warranty for accidental damage ? .
does anyone know of an online store that sells canons with warranties that cover more than basic parts and labor ?
at best buy , they have a warranty that also includes drops and spills and basic accidents .
however , i 'm looking for the canon powershot sd850 is and they are n't selling it anymore .
-lrb- at least that 's what some worker at one location told me . -rrb-
any thoughts ?
