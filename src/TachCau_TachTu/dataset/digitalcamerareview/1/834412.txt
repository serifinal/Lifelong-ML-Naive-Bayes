sx230 .
i ca n't find answers anywhere and i have to know by tomorrow whether to keep this camera .
1 .
why in the world would it say 1080i on any tv i watch my videos on when canon claims this produces 1080p ?
is it one of those stupid technicalities where it 's only 1080p in some vague sense of the word ?
2 .
i was shooting video today while i was away from the camera and ahd it sitting somewhere .
for some reason it stopped recording and closed up after 3 and 1/2 minutes .
i thought maybe the battery died , but it was not quite dead and alloweed me to turn it on and watch that whole video .
surely that setting for having it turn off due to inactivity would not apply when you are recording ?????? that 's not inactivity as it 's recording !
3 .
even those complaining about battery life still claimed to get 200 pics from a charge .
i only took less than twenty pics and maybe 15 or elss minutes of video on one charge before it was totally dead .
that seems insane .
i love the camera other than figuring out these issues and also as i feared i read that 24 fps is bad for anythign moving .
so now it comes down to have superior pictures with this , but worse video ( great , but worse during motions apparently ) or have the inferior ( in my opinion from seeing sampels ) sony hx9v , but 60 fps video .
i would not consider any camera other than those two so one has better iq and one has ( apparently ) better video quality .
video looks amazing on this canon , but it 's 24 fps .
