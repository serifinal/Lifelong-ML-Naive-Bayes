help required in selecting a digital camera .
hi , i am new to this forum and new to digital camera too .
i am planning to but a digital camera whose price range is 150 - 200 $ .
after going through some of the sites and reading the reviews i got an idea that canon and sony are the best in digital cameras .
i have shortlisted a few from canon .
the options are 1 ) canon powershot sd770 2 ) canon powershot sd790 3 ) canon powershot sx110 4 ) canon powershot sd1100 the reviews for all of them are good but out of the 4 the 3 ( sd770 , sd790 and sd1100 ) have an optical zoom of 3x .
i am not sure whether 3x optical zoom is good enough .
my main use would be taking pictures when i go on trips and on occasions .
i am not a photographer in sony i could not find any good model can you kindly suggest some options in sony and which one would you recommend thanks sid
