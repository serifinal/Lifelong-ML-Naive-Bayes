first lens for a 30d ? .
just purchased a 30d body -lrb- my first digital -rrb- and now i need a lens for it .
not sure exactly what type of pictures i will be taking so just looking for a good all around prime or decent zoom .
my budget would be under $ 500 .
would appreciate any suggestions as there are a lot of options out there .
thanks shawn
