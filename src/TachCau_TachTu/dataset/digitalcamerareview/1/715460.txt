i need help ; first time buyer .
all right so im stuck between buying a canon rebel xsi or a nikon d3000 .
the canon comes with a bag , 4 gb memory card , and all the other stuff in the kit along with a 18 - 55 mm lens and a 55 - 250 mm lens all together for $ 759.00 + tax .
the nikon , on the other hand , is only $ 500 but it just comes with the kit and an 18 - 55 mm lens .
this is my first dslr camera , and im torn between these two .
any advice is appreciated .
thanks !
