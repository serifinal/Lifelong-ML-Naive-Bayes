is this a good deal ( eos - 30d ) ? .
hi , i 'm completely new to these forums and i did search a little before posting .
here is my question , here in canada i can get this : eos 30d body + case + canon ef - s 18 - 55 mm lens + protama 58 mm uv filter + 512 mb cf card + card reader usb + extra batteries + 1 year canon warranty for a grand total of 929 $ with free shipping .
so basically , is this a good deal or normal price or a rip - off ?
i can get my hand on a eos 40d but i 'm not sure if the price difference ( + 600 $ ) is worth it .
thanks for any inputs .
