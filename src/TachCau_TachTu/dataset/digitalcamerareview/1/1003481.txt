upgrade from old s500 .
i got a canon s500 back around 4/05 and am trying to decide if i should upgrade soon ... my main complaints are blurry images without flash in indoor lighting .
the image quality when i can get a sharp shot is fine , no complaints with that really , but the frequent blurry images are what gets me .
how do the newer cameras compare ?
