ca n't back up far enough with my 50 mm 1.4 .
hi everyone .
i 'm new here and this is my first post .
i just received my new canon 40d today .
i bought the body and lens separately based on info i read on this site .
i 'm an artist and i paint in both watercolor and oil .
i update my website on a daily basis by taking photos of my paintings in progress .
up til now i used my olympus 2.1 c - 2020 z ( my first digital camera after 25 years of using a pentax spotmatic i bought in the military ) to photo my paintings .
when my oil painting is on it 's easel and very wet , all i had to do with the olympus was to stand 5 feet away and shoot the image .
i just went into my studio and tried to take a photo of a 4 ' x4 ' canvas and i ca n't back up far enough to get the entire canvas in the picture .
ca n't take it outdoors as it is too wet to handle and i do n't want foreign objects sticking to it .
so , i 've got a real nice lens that will work with most of my other needs , but does n't work so well in a confined space .
what other lens should i look at that is in the same quality level as my 50 mm that will allow me to shoot a canvas 4 ' wide from 5 - 6 feet away ?
thanks scott
