which powershot sd is .
.750,800,850 , or 870 ? .
so i did make my decision to try a canon powershot but am now more confused at which one to get !
some are available in stores , some online .
wherever i buy , i want to get it from a store that can take returns , exchanges easily just in in case .
i am looking for ... higher that 6 megapixels decent low light shots with a flash image stabilization face detection compact design decent movie mode i take shots of my friends and i snowboarding , wakeboarding , nightclubs , dogs , indoor and outdoor very bright .
the most ' bang ' for my buck .
thanks for the advice , glad i found this site !
