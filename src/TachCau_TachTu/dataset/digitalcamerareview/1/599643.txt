canon rebel t1i lenses .
i just purchased a dslr and chose the canon rebel t1i .
the kit includes the ef-s 18-55mm is lens , but i am interested in purchasing additional lenses for the camera .
i saw on canon 's website that they offer ef 70-300mm f/4 -5.6 is for around $ 650 but i do n't know if this lens kit will work with the rebel t1i or not .
i also would be interested in a less expensive lens or lenses .
can anyone advise on this ?
