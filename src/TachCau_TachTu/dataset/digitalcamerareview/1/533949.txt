flash on the s95 .
hello everyone , i am looking for a good quality compact for my friend ... .
now he does not want the g11 series because it `` does not look sexy '' so i have been looking around and found the canon s95 i tried it out but the flash seems very weak ... is it possible to adjust the power of the flash on this camera like the g series ?
i could n't really play around in that detail at the time so i could n't see for myself ... thanks
