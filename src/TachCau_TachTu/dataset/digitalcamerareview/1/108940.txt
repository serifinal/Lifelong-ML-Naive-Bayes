sx 100 lens error .
my girlfriend dropped her camera , it hit on the top right of the camera case above the lens .
i am assuming the lens is locked up as it is stuck in the same position , i can hear the motor trying to move it when we power on the camera .
other than sending it in to canon for out of warranty repair , does anyone know what the lens might cost or should i just buy her a new camera ?
thanks , tim
