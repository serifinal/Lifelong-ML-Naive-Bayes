g9 or sx130 .
hi all .
i was using a powershot g9 until recently i lost it / it got stolen .
i 'm looking to replace it .
im currently in japan and i found a used g9 at sofmap for ~ 19800yen , but the sx130 is on sale everywhere for 16800yen .
i know the g9 is fairly dated at this point , and that maybe the sx130 would be a better replacement for it .
please post your comments / thoughts / concerns .
thanks .
