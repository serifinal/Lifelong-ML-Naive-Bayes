new camera recommendation .
hi , earlier i owned a a95 model and loved the features like flip & rotate lcd and quick shooting mode selection .
-lrb- 14 modes by the rotating knob -rrb- .
now i am looking for a simple and small digital camera with above features added to that i prefer to have 2 aa batteries , light weight , easy to use and suitable for both outdoor and indoor shootings .
any suggestion is highly appreciated .
thanks !
