canon vs sony .
my last two digital cameras have been sony 's , and i have n't been very happy with their picture quality , overall .
i heard that canon is basically top of the line when it comes to picture quality , and i wanted to know what you canon - owners think about this !
it 's time for a new camera for me , and i do n't know if i should get the new sony dsc w170 that 's coming out ( it does boast new features that might make the pictures come out better than previous models ) , or just scrap sony altogether and get a canon .
any ideas ?
