reviewing sd1200 photo memory .
hi folks , i guess there is none ?
what does this mean ?
so some type of memory card has to be bought before using this camera ?
how many pics can i hold on any particular size card ?
what type to buy for amatuer type photos ?
as you can tell i am new to this so bear with me .
will this canera allow me to download photos w / o a 2.0 usb port ?
i have an older laptop with windows xp but the older usb port ?
is this an ok camera for vacation type photos ?
thanks paul
