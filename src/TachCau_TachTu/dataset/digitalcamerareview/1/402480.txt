should i upgrade to sd800is .
i 've got a canon a95 that 's slow and a drop bulky for my mobile experience ... i 'm thinking to get the sd800is which is faster , has a wider lens and is definitely more svelte do u guys think the $ 350 is worth it ?
( if it take much better pics it is to me ) what about the sd1000
