sd vs ixus .
hi everyone , i 'm looking at purchasing a camera after christmas , and after looking at online retailers i noticed that the american canon 's models begin with sd xxxx and often they are not the corresponding ixus number available here .
does any one know if there are any variances between sd to corresponding ixus models , what i 'm trying to get at is whether or not there may be certain features available to the sd range not available to the ixus range and vice versa .
the models i 'm interested in are sd850is = > ixus 950 sd870is = > ixus 860 sd950is = > ixus 960 before anyone asks , i 'm purchasing from us because of price differences !
please feel free comment
