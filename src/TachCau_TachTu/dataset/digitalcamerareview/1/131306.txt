satisfied with my digital camera .
few months back i planned to buy a digital camera.sd1000 seems a good choice from a price-performance perspective , but after seeing my friend 's canon sd700 pictures i was totally disappointed with the pictures from sd1000 .
i aslo tested quite a bit comparing pics and the sony was much better , the only issue is the sony does not take great low level lighting pics.now after doing extensive research , i planned to go for sd850 .
it is far far better than sd1000 and i can say it is the real successor of sd700 .
it has all features of sd700 , in addition to that it has many more features which is not available in sd700.i am totally impressed and satisfied with my sd850 .
