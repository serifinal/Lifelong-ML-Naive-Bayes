home - made macro setup for canon s2 .
hi , i plan on buying a macro flash ( not light ) for my canon s2 is .
there digital ones are either really expensive or are leds , which i do n't want .
here 's my plan , tell me if it 'll work : - 35 mm camera ring flash with 52 mm adapter : link - wireless optical slave flash trigger with sync socket : link - canon s2 / s3 / s5 52 mm adapter from lensmate - raynox dcr - 250 super macro filter from lensmate my questions ... 1 ) the macro flash does n't have controllable power and the raynox dcr - 250 is restricted to a working distance of 4 " - 4Â 5/8 " .
how is it possible to take good macro pictures if the flash is n't controllable and i ca n't control the distance ??? 2 ) will this trigger be compatible with the macro flash via the sync socket even if i do n't have anything mounted to the hot shoe of the trigger ?
3 ) will this trigger be compatible with my s2 is ?
in which mode can i disable the pre flash ?
thank you .
regards , yan
