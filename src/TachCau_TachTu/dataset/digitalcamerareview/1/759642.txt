canon powershot sx20 is .
hi , after long search in internet i decided to buy my first camera - canon power shot sx10 is through one of my friend who was in california .
but he has bought sx20is instead of sx10is for me .
i do n't know the differences b / w sx20is and sx10is other than the hd video and 12.1 megapixel improvement on the sx20is version .
i heard from forums that voice tagging and voice recording is not supported in sx20is .
could anyone tell about the difference between sx10is and sx20is and how 's the picture clarity .
which camera is better .
thanks and regards roshan
