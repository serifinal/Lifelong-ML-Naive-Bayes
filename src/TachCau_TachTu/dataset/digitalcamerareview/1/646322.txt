best / cheap " regular " 4 gb sd card for s5 is ? .
i just got my s5 is and i 'm looking for a 4 gb non-sdhc card for it , so that i can put it into my samsung i730 pocket pc phone when i 'm on the go if i want to upload photos to the web or send them to my home computer .
i 'm looking for quality and something that 's inexpensive of course .
http://dcresource.pricegrabber.com/s.../sortby=pricea the topram card on there seems to be the least expensive 150x model , but i need to know user opinions on it first .
i suppose if they have a good warranty policy then that might affect my decision as well , but i want to get this right the first time of course .
i think between $ 30 - $ 40 is about as much as i 'd be willing to spend on an sd card .
also , i want the build quality to be good .
i have an a-data 4 gb 150x regular sd card , but it 's starting to fall apart from ejecting in and out of my i730 .
i do n't know if it 's a design problem with all sd cards or what and the plastic breaks over time if you 're not just " super careful " when inserting and removing the card .
anyway , that 's about all i can think of right now .
let me know , thanks !
