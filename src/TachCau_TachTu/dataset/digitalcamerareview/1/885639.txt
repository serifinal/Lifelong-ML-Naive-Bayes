advice on canon lenses for 40d .
hi i 'm looking to buy a new canon lense for sports photography ( mostly outside moving shots like athletics ) .
i 'd like a zoom capacity for distance and i 'm thinking 70 - 200 mm .
i 'm not sure whether to go image stabilizing or f / 2.8 as both in one lense is a little too expensive for me at the moment .
someone suggested 70 - 200 f / 4 l would be good .
does anyone have any advice ?
i have a 24 - 70 mm f / 2.8 l which i love at the moment .
