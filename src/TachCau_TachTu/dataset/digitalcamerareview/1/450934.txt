which powershot ? .
my old and trusty s2is is nearing the end of its life .
due to many drops and bouncing around inside the jeep as my do everything camera .
so i have been looking to replace it but many of the reviews are saying the sx30 does n't have a great picture due to the 14.1 packing into the small ccd .
so should i grab a used sx20 , a used s5 is or a new sx30 ?
or is there another big optical zoom with video choice that would be better .
picture quality is my main concern .
which of the 3 is going to give the best picture .
really wanted to stay with the canon brand because to my the s2 is was a great camera .
95 % of my shooting is outside daytime events -lrb- jeeps rock crawling -rrb- and double duty as the inside flash camera for holidays with the family .
thanks for any help i can get new camera noob .
