canon a85 v a590is battery life .
while i wait to buy a dslr i 'm getting anxious and considering the a590is as an upgrade from my old a85 .
one key difference is the a85 takes 4 aa batteries and the a590is takes only 2 aa 's .
should i assume then that the a590is will get 1/2 the battery life when compared to the a85 ?
maybe a trivial question but if you do n't know , ask ; right ?
