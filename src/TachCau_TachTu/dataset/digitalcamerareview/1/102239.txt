questions on the a95 .
i 'm considering purchasing this camera because i have read so many wonderful reviews .
i do have a question and was hoping i could get some input from actual owners .
i read in a review ( on another site ) that transferring pictures from the camera to a computer with windows xp is difficult .
i believe they were having a problem with the software and have n't been able to find any help .
so ... .
my question is if any of you know of such a problem and if it has been fixed ?
i would hate to buy the camera and then not be able to transfer photos thanks for any input !!
