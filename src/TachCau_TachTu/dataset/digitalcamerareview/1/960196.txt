cannon power shot sx200is .
i am considering buying a cannon power shot sx200is .
when i look at the various retail listings and prices i can find nothing that tells me what comes with the camera ( if anything ) for the sale price .
i think that it would come with a fairly small memory card and that i probably want to upgrade ; but what about the usb cable and pc install software ?
also , will this camera run off regualr batteries ?
also , does anyone know if this camera has a quick responce once the picture button is hit ?
