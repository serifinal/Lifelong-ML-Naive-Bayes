sx120 availability .
is there any reason to believe the sx120 will be discontinued in the next couple of months ?
i 'm thinking this may be the best camera for me to take on a 2700 mile hike this year .
the big attraction are the batteries since i can find spares anywhere without the hassle or weight of a charger .
i will probably use nimh batteries and a solar charger because my other devices also use aa 's , but it 's nice to know i can always pick up alkalines or lithiums if something happens .
money is tight for this trip , so i want to postpone buying it until the last minute ... hopefully it 's still there .
i 'll probably try contacting canon on monday , but i 'm hoping someone here already knows what 's up .
