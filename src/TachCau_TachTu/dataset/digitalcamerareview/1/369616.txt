canon eos 40 d pricing .... .
alright i am going to get the 40d i think . .
i am new to slr , but i really like this model .
now on the main site it states its $ 1,400 .
i have found package deals off of other various websites having the price around $ 600 - 900 ... do you think those warehouse like places selling cameras and other accessories is / are shady or fake ?
