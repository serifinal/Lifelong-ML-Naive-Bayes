need a new canon point / shoot .
hello !
this is my first post , so i apologize if i 'm doing something wrong ... i 'm need to buy a new camera .
my original camera was a power-shot a95 .
my current one is an sd1000 , purchased in approx 12/07 .
i used to love it , except that i 've always found indoor pictures -lrb- beyond flash range -rrb- very grainy , and when using the flash , it can easily take 5-8 seconds for the picture to take - very embarrassing when we 're lined up for family portraits and everyone has the frozen smile while waiting for the photo to snap .
i recently tried the s95 for a few days , and fell in love with it .
unfortunately , i ca n't afford the $ 400 price tag .
i looked into 2 other canon 's - the 100 hs and the 300 hs , and on paper , they seem very similar .
the difference i see is the focal length , but i 'm not quite sure what i need .
what i 'm looking for is : * small enough to fit in purse / jeans .
* able to take clear fast pictures -lrb- anything better than my current camera will work just fine -rrb- .
* around $ 200 -lrb- i know the 300 hs is $ 250 , but if it 's worth the difference ... -rrb- * has a few easy to use picture settings for indoors / kids / etc -lrb- i know the s95 auto-selects , my current one has a menu -rrb- * shoots decent video * must take fast non-grainy pictures indoors -lrb- or in low-light -rrb- * able to switch from auto and manual flash as necessary i do n't know how aperture with affect me .
i do n't need a beautiful screen .
i do n't plan on turning photos into murals , and do n't have to zoom in on a plane flying 500 ft away .
all i want it something that takes good pictures of family and makes for decent sightseeing memories .
any suggestions -lrb- even if it 's something other than canon -rrb- , would be great .
thanks in advance .
christine
