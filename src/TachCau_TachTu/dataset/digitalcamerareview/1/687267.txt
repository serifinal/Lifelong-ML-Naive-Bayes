new camera help .
thanks in advance for the opinions !
currently i have a 30d , 4 lenses , and have been very happy with it .
i plan on upgrading the body , but want to eliminate the need for a video camera , and a still camera .
which canon should i look for trying to balance still and video ?
i have noticed some of the canons only allow 12 minute clips ?
does this mean that the video card is limited to 4 gb for the camera , hold x amount of clips ?
i guess i just think it will be a pain if every 12 minutes you need to switch cards .
i would like to spend around 1k , but if spending 2k is necessary for me , i can .
i am no pro , but i enjoy photography , and would say i am about a 6 out of 10 when it comes to camera knowledge .
