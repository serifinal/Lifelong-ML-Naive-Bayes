battery dilemma .
for christmas i 'm getting the canon powershot a570is , a nice camera which meets all my requirements .
i especially like that it uses standard aa batteries .
now i need to decide which rechargeable batteries i want to use .
i need to decide before monday , because then my father 's going to our supplier for the last time this year -lrb- our store also sells batteries -rrb- .
i can choose between two pairs of the standard gp nimh 2700 mah or two pairs of the new gp recyko .
the advantage of the standard 2700 mah is that it will last longer , because the recyko 's are only 2050 mah .
on the other hand there are times when i do n't take a lot of photographs and the recyko 's wo n't discharge over time , like the standard nimh .
which means that i will always have a set of full batteries available .
i ca n't choose and keep going backwards and forward between both .
any advice would be welcome .
tia .
