re : recommended cameras .
i have been reading reviews about the canon powershot sd700 , and there seem to be quite a few complaints about the " red eye " condition .
any suggestions ?
i am pretty much of a camera novice , so i want a camera that is easy to use but with some nice features that i can use as i become more knowledgeable .
