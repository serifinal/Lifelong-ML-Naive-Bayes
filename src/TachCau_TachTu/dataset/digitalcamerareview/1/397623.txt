canon sd1000 screen size .
hi guys , i 'm wondering not what the size of the actual lcd screen is ( i know its 2.5 " ) but if there is any extra border around the actual lcd .
could someone who owns a canon sd1000 camera , take out a ruler and give me accurate measurements of the screen .
the reason i ask this , is because i 'm getting this camera for christmas and would like to buy a screen protector a head of time .
and some people were saying that for some camera 's that advertise a 2.5 " lcd you should really buy a 2.6 or 2.7 " screen protector for the camera .
thanks a lot !
