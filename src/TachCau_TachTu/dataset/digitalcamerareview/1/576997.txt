used rebel xt + lenses , or wait for deal on rebel xs ? .
i am debating my digital slr purchase right now ... i have a friend at work who has a fairly immaculate rebel xt ( 350d ) who may be willing to part with that , a uv filter , 4 and 6 point star filter , and polarizing filter for $ 350 .
that would leave me quite a chunk of change to pick up a telephoto and 50 mm fixed if i go that route .
my other choice is to wait on a rebel xs to go on special for a great price / included telephoto / rebates like i have just missed the last few months .
i guess my question is , if i 'm not doing anything with continuous shooting mode , would there be much difference between the two .
so the choices for me ( right now ) are : canon rebel xt ( 350d ) w / kit lens canon normal ef 50 mm f / 1.8 ii autofocus lens tamron zoom telephoto af 75 - 300 mm f / 4.0 - 5.6 ld macro autofocus lens for canon eos circular polarizer 4 point star filter 6 point star filter ==================== $ 555 or : canon rebel xs w / kit lens ==================== $ 499 or wait for a special on the xs , if they 'll have one , to make it more comparable to the xt deal from my friend .
