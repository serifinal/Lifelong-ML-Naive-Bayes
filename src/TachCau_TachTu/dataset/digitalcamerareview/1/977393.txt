35 mm lenses on powershot .
my dad has a lot of lenses for his old 35 mm canon .
not sure what model i think the camera is about 20 - 25 years old is there any way i could get these lenses to work on my powershot s2 ?
i thought i could get an adapter for this but not sure exactly what one i need .
thanks !!
