buying a canon need help choosing !? .
i am planning on buying a new digital camcorder .
i plan on waiting till march when they release the new canon vixia hf s30 .
right now they have the canon vixia hf s21 which is basically the same as the s30 except the s21 has a 64 gb internal memory while the s30 has a 32 gb and the s30 has two sdxc compatible sd memory card slots for faster transfer .
the vixia hf s30 price starts at $ 1,099.99 .
the vixia hf s21 price starts at $ 1,300.00 ( although i found a website selling it for $ 999.00 ) after reviewing these two camera 's i looked at the canon vixia hf s20 also which has the same exact specs as the vixia hf s21 but has a 32 gb internal memory instead of a 64 gb .
vixia hf s20 price starts at 999.99 ( although i found a website selling it for $ 792.95 ) i am a freshman film major in college and i want a camera that will be able to last me for a good amount of years .
i am mainly interested in getting the best picture quality along with zoom .
with your guys impute i was hoping you would be able to help me decide which camera would be best and make the most sense to buy ?
p.s. i plan on waiting till march not only for the vixia hf s30 to be released , but also hoping that once it is released maybe the prices of the other 2 cameras will drop ?
