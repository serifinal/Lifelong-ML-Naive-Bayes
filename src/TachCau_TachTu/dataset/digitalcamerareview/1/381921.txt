repair or replace sd1000 .
i have a 2 year old , out of warranty , canon sd1000 .
it needs to be repaired .
the cost is $ 100 .
in addition , i have lost the battery charger .
that will cost me extra as well to replace .
should i repair the camera or replace it ?
i would be out $ 100 plus the cost of replacing the battery charger .
i looked at the sd1200is .
i assume that is the current generation release of the sd1000 line .
it is available for about $ 165 ( and that includes a battery charger ! ) .
thanks .
