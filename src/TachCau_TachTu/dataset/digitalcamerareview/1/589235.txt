camera help . .
please . .
i 'm a first year student at stafford technical center in digital arts .
i 'm there because i want to be a photographer and it will get me a good base before i get out of high school .
i do n't have a camera of my own so i usually check out the ones from my class but i want my own .
i 'm not on a level where i can use a d - slr . .
yet .
if / when i get accepted back for a second year we learn how to use the canon rebel eos ( i think 5d but i 'm not sure ) .
so i 'm wondering which camera , prefferably of the canon powershot variety , would be good for me to get .
i do n't want a point and shoot " myspace angle " camera but something more along the lines of a semi-professional camera .
something that still takes good quality pictures and has professional settings but that i do n't have to get seperate lenses for .
something with the lens already built in .
i may sound like a noob but i just want a camera that i 'm comfortable using .
so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated .
seriously .
thanks much !!
