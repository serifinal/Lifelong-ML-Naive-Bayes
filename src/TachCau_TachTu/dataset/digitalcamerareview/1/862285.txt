canon e1 plastic ? .
is the canon e1 made of plastic ?
i really want it ( 13 year old ) in blue . .
there is no other camera i want but its a tad expensive but im willing to pay it iv looked everywhere and there is no other camera i want !!
just worried is it plastic because that will make it look more childish than it already is !!
.... yes im a mature 13 year old !!
