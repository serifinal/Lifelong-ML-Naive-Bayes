a710is vs. a570is .
hello , i am looking to purchase my first digital camera , and after doing some research i have decided to buy a camera from canon 's powershot line .
my question is this : given very average needs , which is a better buy : the a710 model at around $ 105 or the a570 model at around $ 145 i am not really sure how much changed between the two cameras , but the a710 seems to be the better deal ?
if you could give me any suggestions i would be grateful .
thank you !
ryan
