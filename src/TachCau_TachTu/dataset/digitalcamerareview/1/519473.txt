canon - sd series strongest flash and/or best coverage . .
hi , i want to buy one of the sd series cameras .
i owned the sd700 and like the camera except the flash coverage at wide angle - with close objects and flash i 'd get a dark corner that was bothersome .
if interested see link below .
anyway , of the remaining sd series cameras which one has the strongest flash power and/or best -lrb- even -rrb- coverage at wide angle and telephoto ?
i want to avoid the issue with dark corners .
issue with sd700 link : http://www.dcresource.com/forums/sho...t=sd700+vig%2a regarding flash coverage i found links below .
it seems that overall flash coverage -lrb- `` even-ness '' -rrb- : - in 700 and 800 are the worst -lrb- wide angle -rrb- - in 750 and 900 have the best balance between coverage and wide angle and telephoto -lrb- a little dim though -rrb- .
note : i thought the 750 and 1000 where the same cameras .
why the clear diff in flash coverage ?
sd900 : http://www.imaging-resource.com/prods/sd900/sd900a5.htm sd800 : http://www.imaging-resource.com/prod.../sd800isa5.htm sd700 : http://www.imaging-resource.com/prods/sd700/sd700a5.htm sd750 : http://www.imaging-resource.com/prods/sd750/sd750a5.htm sd1000 : http://www.imaging-resource.com/prod...0/sd1000a5.htm anyway , after all this .
if i were to try to avoid the dark corners i had seen while i owned the 700 , which camera would you pick among the other sd series ?
thx !
