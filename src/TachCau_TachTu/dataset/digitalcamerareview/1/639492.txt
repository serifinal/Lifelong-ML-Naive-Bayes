powershot sx 10 " version " .
i just was about to order a canon sx10 si when the salesperson asked if i wanted the us or eruopean version .
i asked the difference and he said the instruction book .
he also said the difference in cost is $ 350 + for us and $ 264 for the eruopean .
it sounds fishy to me and ca n't find anything on google .
anyone have information on us vs european versions ??
