unhappy with the sx110 .
i 've owned this camera for a week or so and am half tempted to return it .
at first , it seemed like an awesome camera for the price .
outdoors , it works great !
some of the best photos i 've ever taken .
inside , is another story .
no matter how many lights are on in my house , it insists i use the flash .
it can be bright as can be and the photos still turn out blurry ( without the flash ) .
i took the camera to a wrestling event last week and some of my pictures were great ( using flash , of course ) but the amount of time it took for the flash to recharge was tremendous .
i also got very irritated when the zoom started to ' freeze ' up .
is this common for the sx110 or do i have a bad camera ?
i was taking a lot of photos , but the battery was nowhere near being dead so i could n't even blame it on that .
also , there have been numerous times when the auto - focus green box would not appear on my screen , nor would it allow me to take a photo without it , even with the button being pressed down entirely .
very frustrating !
now , it wo n't allow me to use digital zoom any longer .
i have n't checked the manual yet but when i go into the menu , it skips right over the option for digital zoom . .
does n't make a lot of sense to me .
perhaps i 've screwed up a setting somewhere along the way .
needless to say , i did n't spend $ 220 + to only be able to take outdoor shots .
do you think i have a camera with a glitch or are these problems common with all powershot sx110 's ?
my friend 's brother recently purchased the kodak easyshare zd8612 from wal - mart for under $ 200 , and it has a higher optical zoom as well as megapixels .
i 'm half tempted to purchase that in place of the canon sx110 .
any thoughts ?
opinions ?
i 'm at my wits end . .
