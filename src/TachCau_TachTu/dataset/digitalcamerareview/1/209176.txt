canon sd1000 battery and charger needed . .
hi , i have a canon sd1000 and i recently lost my battery and charger .
i was looking to replace them both with factory canon products , however i was curious if anyone has purchased the " no - name " products and are pleased with them .
i do n't mind buying the canon brand however i am looking to save as much money as possible .
if there are some recommendations of where to buy from it would be greatly appreciated .
thank you .
mike
