sd4000 or sx210is ? .
i am currently looking to replace my ( very ) old digital camera and narrowed it down to 2 choices : the canon sd4000 or sx210is i like the better zoom on the sx but overall the sd4000 seems to have the upper hand feature wise .
any recommendations for either or ?
( i wish the full review of the sd4000 would be up already )
