canon 1000/450 stock lens ( es ) .
hi , i 'm an slr newbie and am a debating which camera to get .
so far i 've probably narrowed it down to the olympus e520 or canon 1000d / 450d .
i 'm unlikely to purchase many lenses beyond the range that usually come in the " twin packs " with the possible exception of an ultrawide angle , or a prime 50 mm for low light .
olympus 's offering is very attractive as the kit lenses appear to be consistently praised .
not as good as pro lenses , but better than other manufacturers in terms of vignetting , resolution etc. .
the story for canon seems mixed .
some get good results , but generally the quality does n't seem as good ( but better than sony which seems to get totally slated for the kit lenses on the axxx range ? ) .
however the " ecosystem " around canon is much greater making for a far broader range of affordable after - market options .
so my question is whether it 's worth just going for a body , or body +1 lens and filling out the telephoto option with a standalone purchase .
thing is there 's a bewildering array of options .
i 'd really be looking for something in the 70 - 200 range , and feel i would benefit from is .
i can see ef - s 55 - 250 mm f4 - 5.6 is - ~ 200 ukp canon ef - s 18 - 55 mm f3.5 - 5.6 is ~ 120 ukp but i 'm really looking to spend around the 450 - 600 mark all - in .
with the 1000d around 300 this barely squeezes in -- but are these lenses any better than the kit lenses ( are they the same ) .
if so is there a letter lens option ?
am i overly concerned about the stock lens ?
