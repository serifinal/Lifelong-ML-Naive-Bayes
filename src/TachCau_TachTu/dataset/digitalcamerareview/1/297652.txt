canon sx110is .
hello , i just rec 'd my sx110is , but i have some concerns : - 1 ) the camera gets hitted up just after some 15 or 20 mins of usage .
is it in order ?
2 ) i ca n't get the digital zoom on !
under whatever shooting modes the menu does n't allow me to put on the function , the selector totally skips that function .
