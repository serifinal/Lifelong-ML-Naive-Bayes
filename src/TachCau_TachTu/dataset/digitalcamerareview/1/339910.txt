?
about canon powershot sx10 is power adapter .
recently got this great camera but was told it did n't have another power source other than batteries .
just read in the manual that there is a power adapter ca-ps700 .
since i take many of my wildlife pics from inside through a window , a plug in would be great - if it 's long enough or can handle an extension cord .
i read reviews and it seems like this is what i need , although some reviewers -lrb- and one description referred to it as a charger . -rrb-
anyone have one and/or know about how long it is ?
thanks !!
