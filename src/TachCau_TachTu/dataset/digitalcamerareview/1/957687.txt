new canon .
i am looking at getting a canon after reading many positive reviews .
i currently have a kodak v610 which i bought for the 10x zoom , however , the photo quality is not great on it .
i love using my zoom , but i also carry my camera with me at all times .
i am looking at the sx 100 - is and the sd 1100 .
the sx100 obviously has more zoom , but it is also larger in size .
i also looked at the olympus stylus 1010 but have heard better review on canon so i am hesitant to try that .
zoom is important to me , but i do n't know how much of a difference i will be able to tell in these two cameras .
any advice would be appreciated !
