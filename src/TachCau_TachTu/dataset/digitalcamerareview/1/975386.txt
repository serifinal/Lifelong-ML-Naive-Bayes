what lens do need ? .
hi !
: 0 ) i have been playing around with the cam after reading understanding exposure , after troubleshooting everything recc , i think i may need a new lens ?
i have a canon s5 is .
i love taking close up pics of my babies .
you know , pics where their sweet chubby face fills the entire frame ?
i usually try to do this when they are about 1 - 2 feet from me .
i am getting blur .
i am pretty sure i am too close to them , but if i back up , the pic is not as close as i want it .
is there a lens that i can order that will help me with this ?
second , i love taking pics of my boys playing .
i am usually pretty far away , and i zoom in .
when i try to zoom in to get a closer pic , their faces are soft .
can a diff lens help me with this ?
or ... maybe can someone give me a rundown of what each of the diff lenses do ?
