canon sx30 - power button question .
i 'm thinking of buying a canon sx30 .
does the power button click when you press it and does it stay pressed in until you press it again to turn the camera off ?
i 'm used to the switches that you rotate to turn on and off the camera , not press .
just wondering .
thanks .
