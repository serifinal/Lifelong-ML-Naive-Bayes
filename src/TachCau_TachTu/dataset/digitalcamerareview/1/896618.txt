yup , it 's the a570 vs a720 question again ! .
ok , basically the difference in features is 8mp vs 7mp , and 6x vs 4x .
i would like to know ( from someone who has had experience with both cameras ) : comparatively , which has 1 - better overall ( indoor / outdoor ) picture quality 2 - better battery performance 3 - faster ( shutter lag / shot to shot / flash recycle ) operation 4 - less red - eye problems thank you !
