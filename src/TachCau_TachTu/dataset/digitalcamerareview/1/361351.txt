good deal ?
camera , printer , paper deal .
i 'm in the market for a camera and i have my eyes set on a a570 is .
and while shopping around i came across this deal at walmart .
is it a good deal ?
i really do need a new printer , i have both a separate printer / scanner taking up space on my desk , so i 'm considering getting this to replace the two .
the photo paper is icing on the cake too .
