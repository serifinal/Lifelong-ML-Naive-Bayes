canon xsi & lens choice .
david wrote a review on the entry level dslr canon xsi back in may 2008 and was the ' editors choice for may ' 08 .
and he said there were better lens choices then the ' kit ' lens .
i am curious which lenses would anyone recommend for this camera to bring out it 's ' true potential ?
