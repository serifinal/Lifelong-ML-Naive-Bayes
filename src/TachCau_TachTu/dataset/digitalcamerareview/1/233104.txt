canon eos 1000d with ef lens .
hi all i have an old canon eos500n film slr camera with ef 28 - 80 mm usm lens .
i am now interested in buying a dslr and was looking at canon eos1000d or canon eos450d .
i understand that both eos1000d and eos450d can take ef and ef - s lenses .
however , what i wanted to know was that by using the ef 28 - 80 mm usm lens , will i lose any functionality ?
also , is it important / better to get an is lens ?
many thanks for your answers .
