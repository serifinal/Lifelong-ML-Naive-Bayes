sd870is - which sd card .
a review of the sd870is from dpreview notes : " the sd870 takes around 1.1 seconds to process and save a ~ 4.0 mb 8mp / super fine jpeg ( exact size depends on the complexity of the image being shot ) ; which is by no means tardy .
given this relatively fast performance , it makes sense to use a fast card to prevent adding a bottleneck to the process . "
sandisk 's ultra 2 ( a class 4 card ) writes 9mb / sec while the extreme 3 ( class 6 ) writes at 20mb / sec it seems like either way both these cards can outpace the camera .
what will i be missing if i buy the cheaper ultra 2 ?
how will the movie mode be affected ?
