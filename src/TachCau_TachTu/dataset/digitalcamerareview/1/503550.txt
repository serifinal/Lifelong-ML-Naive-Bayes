40d is over my budget $ $ $ options ? .
am planning on buying my first digital slr soon .
i have been shooting film slr 's for years but my only digital experience is with a point and shoot .
i was looking at the xt/xti / d40 's but when i went to the store to try them did not like the small size of them and the way they felt in my hands .
the camera shop guy let me try a canon 40d and that felt much more comfortable .
problem is the 40d is a little out of my price range .
i 'm wondering about a 30d .
are they similar in size ?
and are they a decent camera ?
i know this is a canon forum but also what about the nikon d80 is it equal to the 30d ?
thanks shawn
