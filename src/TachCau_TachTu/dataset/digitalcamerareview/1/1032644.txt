a590 is vs. sd750 .
http://www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/prodde...74&catid=20220 + aa batteries + 4x zoom + 8 mp + cheaper + image stabilization http://www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/prodde...12&catid=22474 + 3 " lcd screen + faster in shooting pics + better movie mode + ultra-compact i know it 's weird to compare , especially since sd750 is an ultracompact .
but i 'm torn between these two .
this is gon na be mainly for family events and stuff .
i think the dealbreaker will be which one takes better pictures .
i ca n't find any comparison on the net , so tips ?
