looking for a canon zoom lens .
i am looking for a reasonably priced ( under $ 300 ) zoom lens for a canon rebel xt eos 350d .
i need something in the range of 70 - 300mm that can shoot clear actions shots at distance .
an example would be rodeo action in daylight .
i want to shoot in continuous shot mode without a tripod .
please advise .
