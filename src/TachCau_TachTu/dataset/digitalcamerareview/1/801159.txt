ixus 980 are colors too vivid ? .
hello i am considering buying a ixus 980 because of the great reviews it gets when it comes to image quality .
but when i look at sample pictures i think the colors are way too vivid .
like the red is too red and green is too gren and so on .
does anyone agree with me and is there an easy way to correct this setting ?
does the panasonic zs3 produce better images , ( sharper and more accurate colors ) ?
