a710is vs a570is and digic ii vs digic iii .
ok , so i was very much set on getting that a710is .
it 's just that i was waiting for my creditcard 's award points to rack up enough ( i just need to wait for it to be updated as i finally do have enough points to order 3x $ 100 gift cards for j&r ) .
and in the meanwhile , this thing called a570is comes out with the new digic iii processor .
currently from j&r a710 goes for $ 264.88 and a570 goes for $ 279.99 ( pre-order ) .
i do n't really need that huge 6x zoom ( it may come in handy like ... once or twice a year ) .
i would think these two would be similar in picture quality .
oh and i also want to know if there may be some difference in the tft screens also ( low temp vs amorphous ? )
finally , though i could be horribly wrong , the newer processor might give a570 a bit more battery , either or both because it just might be more efficient and / or since it processes stuff faster , less time wasted on sucking up the juice .
any suggestions ?
