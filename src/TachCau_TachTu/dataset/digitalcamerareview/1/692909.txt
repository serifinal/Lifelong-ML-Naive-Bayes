sd700 / 800is pricing .
since the sd700 is kind of a rarity to find in stores nowadays , i did find it somewhere for about $ 300 ( reputable dealer , currently on order not in stock ) , tax and shipping included , new .
i do n't know if i should jump on this or wait on it since prices , opposed to what many have said , have actually gone up over the past two months or so on these models .
i also can try to get the sd800 for about $ 340 or so from the current office depot 20 &#37; off all non-dslr canon cameras $ 199 and up if a price match is accepted , but that may be hard since it 's not currently in stock and only goes until 1/27 .
any expert advice on the pricing changes that i should expect ?
or maybe any awesome upcoming dell camera coupons to be expected ?
not sure how often dell does it .
