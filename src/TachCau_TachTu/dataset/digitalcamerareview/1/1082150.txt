sx10 is indoor sports settings ? .
i got the cannon powershot sx10 is and am completely thrilled by it 's results .
but , i am having problems setting it up to shoot my daughter 's basketball games .
it seems the relativly low - light of gymnasiums is giving me all sorts of headaches trying to find the right setting to catch the action at speed .
i 'm trying to aproach this from not using the flash .
i may be a bit over-whelmed by all the different shooting modes and how to mix in f - stop , iso and shutter speed .
i can see the graininess when using 1600 - 3000 iso setting and just do n't know what else to do ... any suggestions would be greatly appreciated !
