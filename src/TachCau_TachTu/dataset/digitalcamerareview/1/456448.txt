canon ef 28 - 135 mm lens ? .
hi everyone !
after a long hiatus , i 've returned from notebookreview , because of course , my interest in serious photography has returned !
this time , i 've inherited my dad 's canon eos 20d ( he jumped to the 5d mark ii ) , so that helps motivate me from my previous point - and - shoot , the sd800 .
so i 'm still using the 17 - 85 mm lens , and i think its a good idea to replace it .
i 've heard mixed opinions about the ef 28 - 135 mm lens , i wonder if any of you guys can give more insight ?
i 'm mainly using it as a general lens , for everyday - usage .
my dad ( and now i , since i inherited the 20d ) has a long - range lens so i have that otherwise .
i want a better lens for everyday photos , indoor photos , and definitely good image stability .
is the 28 - 135 mm the right lens for this ?
if not , any others under $ 400 you guys could recommend me ?
thanks a ton !
sam
