canon australian cameras .
i 'm looking at getting a new camera and came across these two , the canon ixus 860 ( powershot sd870 ) and the ixus 870 ( powershot sd880 ) ( why ca n't they keep the same numbering system ? ) .
when i googled them the following links to the canon australia website came up .
http://www.canon.com.au/products/cam...ixus860is.aspx http://www.canon.com.au/products/cam...ixus870is.aspx the main camera menu on the canon website does n't show these cameras , however , and i ca n't find many places that sell them ( only online stores ) .
are these discontinued models in australia as it appears that they are still being sold overseas .
thanks
