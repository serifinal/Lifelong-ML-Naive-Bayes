next lens for the 40d ? .
so some background , i 've a canon 40d , and one of the things i frequently photograph is city scenes .
not street photography of people , but architecture ( inside and outside ) and such in cities .
for daytime work i 've been happy with my sigma 18 - 50 f2 .8 for wide , and my canon 70 - 200 for long , but neither is quite good for night work or dark interiors .
so that leaves me asking this question , what would you recommend for a night lens for buildings and such ?
in my mind the default answer is the canon 50 mm f1 .8 .
it 's not a perfect lens , it feels like a toy , and has a really loud autofocus motor , but optical quality is very good and it 's cheaper than my current camera bag .
so what out there is better , if more money ( say under $ 400ish ) ?
i have had the following ideas : 1 .
canon 50 mm f1 .4 2 .
sigma 50 mm f1 .4 3 .
sigma 30 mm 1.4 4 .
canon 28 mm 1.8 so i leave it to the assembled masses , thoughts , suggestions , ideas ?
