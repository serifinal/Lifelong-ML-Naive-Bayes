sd1200 real world battery life ? .
i 've been searching for a quality , pocketable camera with great battery life .
i like the size ( and reviews ) of the sd1200 .
its battery life is rated at 260 shots .
how does this compare to your real world experiences ?
most of the ultra-compact canon models that i 've looked at have battery life specs that lag compared to some of the other brands ( like sony ) , but i 'm having a difficult time leaving canon .
i currently have an a710 .
the ability to use rechargeable aa 's is great , and they provide juice for a lot of pics , but again , i 'd like to go pocketable and ditch the belt bag .
i 've considered the new a2100 , but it 's still a bit big ( especially compared to the sd1200 ) , and i 'd still have to carry spare aa 's .
even though i 'd probably carry a spare for the sd1200 , the size and weight would be negligable ( and i still would n't need a bag ) .
comments appreciated .
thanks !
