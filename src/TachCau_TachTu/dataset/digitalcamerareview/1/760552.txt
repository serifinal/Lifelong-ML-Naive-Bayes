any news on 5d mk iii - typical odering time mk ii .
visiting back with a question after a long time ... i 'm on an eos 400d - and at some point will want to make a leap ( direct leap bypassing the xxd series ) - i hope for summer 2010 at the latest ( maybe christmas , spring ?? ) .
so , 2 questions : 1 ) what is the typical time for a 5d mk ii to be delivered if orderd by a camera shop - i have seen comments that canon does not seem to produce them quick enough and they are backordered ?
( just a typical value ) 2 ) any news on a mk iii version of the 5d ?
the internet does n't seem to helpful in this respect at the moment .
( i 'd prefer it to a mk iii as it would have to last a long time - so a newer model would be better in this respect ) thanks for any replies ( and there is still plenty of time )
