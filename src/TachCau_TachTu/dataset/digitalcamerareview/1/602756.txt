flash recycle times in sx110 is .
i need to replace my old fave , the canon a75 , and have checked out the 720 is , 590 is , and sx10 , before getting the sx110 is .
my main purpose is to photograph my toddler son .
because of those fleeting moments when it comes to toddlers , i need a reliable point - and - shoot camera that will allow me to take pictures indoors that require a flash , but be able to do so without missing any shots .
the sx110 is has a really long flash recycle time .
i believe i 've managed to address the shutter lag time by getting a 16 gb 150x - speed sd card .
however , despite using two 2500 mah nimh batteries , i am still quite disappointed with how long the flash recycle times are .
i know i can add an external flash to the sx110 ( and the sx10 for that matter ) , but i do n't think a brighter flash will solve the recycle time issue ( i.e. , the period during which the lcd is blacked - out , before i can take the next shot ) .
the sx110 is only takes two aa batteries .
i 'm wondering if canon cameras with 4 aa batteries would solve my problem .
can anybody out there recommend another canon powershot camera that i should get ?
is my only option getting a dslr ?
thanks in advance for any input !
