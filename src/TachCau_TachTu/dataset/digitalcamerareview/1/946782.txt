30d vs. 400d ( probably for the billionth time ) .
hi all , i work for canon australia , and as a canon employee i am entitled to buy products at staff purchase prices ... ( i.e. even cheaper than wholesale ) i was looking at buying the eos 400d ( rebel xti in the us ) , body only and then buying the ef - s 17 - 85 mm f / 4 - 5.6 is usm lens .
i can get all this for around $ 1300 au .
however , i 've started wondering about getting the 30d instead with the same lens as this is available at the moment as a package called the enthusiast kit , and so is only an extra $ 50 or something compared to the eos 400d which i 'll have to buy the lens and the body separately ( staff ca n't buy the enthusiast kit at the moment ) so i 'm torn between the two for the following reasons ... eos 400d - lighter , smaller , higher megapixels , a little cheaper .
but also made of plastic , and a slightly slower fps of only 3 .
eos 30d - heavier , larger , lower megapixels and little more expensive .
made of magnesium ( more durable ) and a faster frames per second of 5 .
does the 30d deliver in other aspects compared to the 400d that make the extra $ $ , weight and size and the fewer megapixels , worth it ?
thanks in advance ....
