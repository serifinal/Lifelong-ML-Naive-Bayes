canon powershot sx100 .
hey guys !
this is my first post on here .
i 've got a powershot sx100 , its been a great camera so far , i 'm just taking pictures of family members and just random shots .
here lately my camera will take one picture or two and then it will just go blank .
its like it turns off for some reason .
i 've checked different battery and it does it with new ones to .
i 'm scared there is a setting messed up on it and i ca n't seem to figure it out .
i do n't want to buy a new one and that be whats wrong .
do you all have any ideas thanksfor the help in advance .
