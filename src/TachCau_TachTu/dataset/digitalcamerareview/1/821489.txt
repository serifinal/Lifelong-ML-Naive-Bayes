where can i buy a " made in japan " canon powershot g7 ? .
i 've asked a dozen websites that carry the camera , but they all say they are not sure where the camera was made .
i also called canon usa asking them if they know the g7 cameras sold in the us are made in japan , they said they could n't keep track of them .
so can anyone tell me where i can buy a g7 that 's made in japan ?
thanks !
