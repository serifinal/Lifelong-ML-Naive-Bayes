canon xsi for newbie .
hello , i am thinking to get a canon rebel xsi -lrb- aka 450d -rrb- .
is this a good camera for taking fast moving pictures ?
my girl does gymnastic .
when using my regular point and shoot camera , i rarely have a picture that is no blurred .
based on what i have read so far , i think canon might able to meet my requirement .
but i still want to hear your advice .
also , i am looking for the cheapest -lrb- and trustworthy -rrb- place to get one in canada or us .
i am thinking to get the kit with two lens .
your comments are welcome !
