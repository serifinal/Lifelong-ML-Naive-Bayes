sd1400 is or sx200 is ? .
hey guys .
i 'm new here and just looking for some insight .
i 'm really stuck in my decision making .
i 've been looking at cameras , mostly canon and seem to always be going back to it , and thought i 'd get the sd1400 is .
however , after seeing the feature set of the sx200 is , it looks like it 'd be a heck of a camera .
i would like to be able to put whatever i get in a pocket ( i 'm a guy , and do n't wear skinny jeans or anything , so either should be fine ) , and otherwise just want a camera with good clarity , clean / sharp edges , little image compression , and good low - light quality .
it looked to me like the sx200 had better quality pictures , but it may be that the ones i saw from the sd1400 were on normal compression settings instead of normal ?
not sure .
guess my questions end up being : does normal - > fine quality make much difference ?
which one would you get in my situation ?
any suggestions other than what i 'm looking at that you think would be better ?
thanks .
edit : i should note that my price point i 'd like to stay at is around $ 230 .
