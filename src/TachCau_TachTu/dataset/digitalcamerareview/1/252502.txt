which canon cameras have no built - in memory ? .
i just bought my first digital camera , a canon power shot sd 600 .
i needed a model with an optical viewfinder as i am unable to see the lcd screen , especially in bright sunshine .
i think thatthe canon has no internal memory as when no sd card is inserted , no photos are stored .
is it common for digital cameras to have no internal memory or is this unique to canon ?
i notice that sony digital cameras have some built - in memory .
i avoided purchasing a sony as it appears that their memory stick is unique to sony and more costly than an sd card .
do any other manufacturers , beside sony , use a memory stick ?
