nikon p80 vs canon s5 is . .
which one is better to buy ? .
hi , i am a lover of nikon lense quality .
i wan na buy nikon p80 -lrb- release 3 days before into market -rrb- bcoz , i needed 10 mp resolution & > 5x optical zoom with manual controls like shutter speed , focus , aperture priority .
in the nikon forums , they suggested me to buy s5is , that is very close to my requirement , the dpreviews were also good .
1 -rrb- i wanted to know is s5is is good enough in quality of lenses 2 -rrb- is g9 more better than s5is 3 -rrb- has anyone used nikon p80 and can i buy that ?
-lrb- this is my first preference -rrb-
