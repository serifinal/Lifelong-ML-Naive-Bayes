best powershot for underwater photo 's ? .
i 'm a dive master that likes to take pictures while diving .
i have been using my sd600 for the past few years and have finally decided to upgrade .
i love the powershots and use a canon wp housing .
i was thinking about the sd990is as i saw some positive personal reviews of the camera on amazon.com though i found this site which was not very pleased with the camera it seems . "
too high a price for what you get . "
i 'm looking for something that i can shoot lots of macro pics with and get nice sharp results .
i also use the camera on land when traveling so it needs to be good there as well .
i 'm confused looking through the site trying to figure out which i should be looking at buying .
oh yes , last thing .
i was hoping to spend around 500 in total .
camera and housing .
the housings usually run around 180 to 200 from canon so around a 300 dollar max camera .
thanks !
help ??
