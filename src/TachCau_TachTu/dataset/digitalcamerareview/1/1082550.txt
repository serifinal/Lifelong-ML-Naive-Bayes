canon camera case .
i have an eos500d with a 75 - 300 zoom .
while i have a backpack to carry my kit , i need a case so that i can tromp around with my gear easily accessible .
i have searched all the sites , and there is a bewildering array of cases available .
i do nt want to get one that is too big , so that i can revert to fitting my 18 - 55 on other occassions .
any suggestions ?
thanks
