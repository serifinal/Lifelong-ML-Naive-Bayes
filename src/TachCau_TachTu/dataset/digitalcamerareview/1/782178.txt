what 's a good all around lens to replace the >> .
kit lens that comes with the canon xsi ( 18 - 55 mm is ) .
im looking for greater zoom and better overall build quality without breaking the bank .
also , what do you folks think about purchasing second hand lenses ?
would that be an alternative to higher priced new lenses and if so , what would you recommend there ?
thanks , gerard
