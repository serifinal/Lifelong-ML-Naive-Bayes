canon powershot g9 vs s5 is .
ladies and gentlemen i am sort of a `` neanderthal '' of digital photography and would like to purchase a top of the line digital camera without venturing into the slr world .
i currently own a minolta dimage which is dawning away .
my choice narrows down to the canon powershot g9 and the s5 is .
both have qualities i like and others i dislike .
i like the g9 but dislike the use of non aa type batteries .
i like the s5 is but it does not have raw -lrb- not fundamental -rrb- .
are they bulky cameras ?
with three kids i do not want slr type material , i have enough to carry around as things stand .
any helps , tips , suggestions ... are more than welcome .
thank you and regards bert
