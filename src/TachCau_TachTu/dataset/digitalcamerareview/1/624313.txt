canon 50d w / wide angle and tele converters .
i have the canon 50d w / 28 - 135 mm lens .
i am interested in enhancing the camera without spending a fortune .
does a decent 2x teleconverter actually double my telephoto to 270 mm ??
and as for wide angle converters , which of these gives you the widest field of view , the .43 x , the .50 x , or the .70 x ??
my reasoning tells me that the .43 x converter would give me 43 % of the low end of my lens , which would be 12 mm and the widest possible field of view .
am i correct ?
i 'm confident that several of you will be familiar with these details .
thanks , virgil
