should i get a 50 mm f / 1.4 ? .
hi guys , a few weeks back i posted about possibly replacing my 17 - 85 mm canon lens , but i 've decided to keep it after all .
i 've really been looking closely at the canon 50 mm f / 1.4 lens , which seems to have very positive reviews .
anyone have first - hand experiences or comments about this lens ?
it is about $ 399 where i get it here in vancouver , canada !
