opinion needed for canon 55mm f1 .8 lens .
i have heard them refered to as ` plastic fantastic ' version , as they are made with plastic bodies .
i do n't know if it is just an iteration play on words , and a sarcasm .
meaning it is really a piece of junk , but as fantastic rymes with plastic , it 's used .
i am heading off to england in about 4 months time , and am planning on going on a photo spree of the sate homes and castles in the area .
as most of these are pretty big and on the dark side , i know i will need a wide angle lense with a pretty low f value .
as i have no experiance with shooting in these conditions , i am not sure if getting the 50mm f1 .8 will be a good enough lens to get the shots that i want .
the price for the lens is pretty cheep , but i do n't know if that is reflective on the quality .
moving up to an f1 .4 costs about 4x more , and i do n't know if it is better to get a tripod and the cheeper lens .
right now i have a canon 40d , but as i just got it i may be returning it and moving up to the 50d as it cost just another $ 150 over what i paid for the 40d .
any advise is appreciated .
matt
