what can i do to improve recharge flash time .
hi : i bought a canon sx110 is a month ago .
i noticed that when using the flash , the camera blinks an orange light ( for a few seconds ) until is it ready for the next picture .
i read that this is the flash recharging .
the question is : what can i do to improve this time ( usually takes 5 - 7 secs ) .
i read that other batteries would not make a significant difference ( 1 - 2 secs less ) what about buying a external speedlight , would that help ?
can i buy an external flash for this camera ?
i have an upcoming event and i need better time that 5 - 7 secs waiting for the flash to recharge .
please advise , thanks ,
