sd850 vs a590 .
any idea how the pictures from these two camera compare specially indoors using flash ?
both of them have 4x zoom and same 35 mm range .
i know that they are of different size and price range and both are among the best in their categories but i want to know if 590 will take better pictures than 850 under the same conditions .
