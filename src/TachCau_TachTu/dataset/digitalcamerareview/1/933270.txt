powershot g11 filter .
my daughter has a powershot g11 and we were thinking of getting her a protective cover for it , perhaps a filter or two .
it bothers my husband that the lens is so exposed .
( our daughter is n't the most conscientious , even with expensive items .
sigh . )
i was looking at an opteka on amazon ( 3 for $ 25 ) .
would this work as indicated or would i need extra equipment .
( i am not sure i would need to get an adapter tube , for instance . )
feedback anyone .
thanks
