canon s5is microphone specs ? .
hey everybody .
my wife and i recently bought the s5is .
it is a great little camera , and being an audio engineer , i like the feature that lets you record 44.1 khz .
wav files with the stereo microphone on the front .
i 'm wondering though if anybody has the specs for that microphone however .
signal - noise ratio , response graph , even what kind of mic it is ( i 'm guessing it 's an electret cardioid , but hey , ca n't hurt to know for sure ! ) .
any info would be greatly appreciated !
