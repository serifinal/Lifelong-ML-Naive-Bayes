help choosing a canon model .
hi there !
my powershot a630 was just dropped by my 4 year old and i 've spent about 30 hours over the last 3 days researching for a replacement .
between subjective user reviews and technical pro reviews , i have a major headache tonight and was hoping you or someone could help me out a little .
i loved my a630 , and would find it helpful to use that as a comparison model with the new models .
i 'll start by sharing what i 'm looking for , then the models i 've considered .
first , it would be awesome to know what cameras would do best under the following conditions .
# 1 ... christmas morning , three kids frantically tearing through presents , hardly any natural light and poor lamp lighting .
my a630 took decent pictures , but i 'd get some blurring .
it would be nice to find a model that improved on the lower light and child movements , but i do n't need something to shoot moving hockey pucks .
# 2 ... bright outdoors .
loved that my a630 had a viewfinder and tilt screen .
no such thing now .
i hate when you ca n't see what you 're shooting .
what model will allow me to see the lcd screen well ?
# 3 ... zoom .
i do n't need to see miles across wyoming .
but i do want to see my kids across the playground .
# 4 ... is there such a thing as a p&s camera that can capture my kids on a stage from half way back a dark auditorium ?
a tall order i know , but the a630 was n't great on that , so will one of the following models improve on that ?
good video would be nice , but not worth a huge price increase ( maybe $ 50 more ) .
extra features would not likely be used .
i 'm not technical and would likely stay in auto mode most of the time , with the exception of experimenting on night shots of kids watching fireworks or toasting smores , etc. .
picture quality is much more important to me than panoramic , fish eye , and all that stuff i 'll never use .
battery life ... my a630 took aa batteries and i felt i got acceptable use , so anything that would be equivalent would be great .
it seems to me that these new models are worse in battery life .
do some have less expensive replacement batteries to use as back ups ?
so here 's the models that caught my eye .
the a95 seems awesome , but pricey .
i 'd rather stay $ 200 - $ 300 unless nothing else will do .
the elph 300 and 500 look good .
i do n't see where the 500 would add much more for my purposes , am i wrong ?
the 4000 or 4500is look good , ca n't tell if the newer version offers me more than what i need .
the sx210 looks good , but seems that a lot of reviewers do n't like some aspects .
which of these , or will another model or brand , suit my purposes without giving me stuff i do n't need ?
i would be so grateful if you could tell me how their picture quality compares with each other , and which would suit my above needs the best .
thanks so much .
