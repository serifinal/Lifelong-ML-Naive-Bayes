a590is or sx100is .
i 'm in need of a good general purpose camera and these two caught my eye .
the 10x zoom on the sx100 is very interesting to me , however the lack of automatic redeye reduction after taking a picture and multi-point autofocus -lrb- aiaf -rrb- is a concern , is the lack of the multi-point autofocus that big a deal ?
the a590 is cheaper of course and has the multi-point autofocus as well as automatic red-eye reduction , but the movie mode has been reduced compared to previous models .
which camera would be more satisfactory to me ?
does picture quality differ greatly betweek the two ?
bear in mind , i do intend to use all the features that either of these camera have -lrb- movies , zoom , etc. -rrb- i 've read numerous reviews on both and am still undecided .
which is the better overall camera ?
thanks for your help !
