canon sd850is vs sd870is .
hello , i am planning to get a canon dc this christmas .
i currently own another brand camera and i 'm unimpressed with the photos taken during night times .
i 've read pretty good reviews for both sd850 is and sd870 is .
more leaning toward sd850 is since 870is does n't have an optical viewer .
any other input from other users about why 870is might be better than 850is aside from the wider angle ?
are either of these cameras good for taking night scenes ?
thank you .
