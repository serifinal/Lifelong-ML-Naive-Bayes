sd870 compact case .
what are you using for your sd870 case ( pouch ) ?
i am looking for a minimalist case .
something to offer a little protection from the elements and handling but not too restrictive for quick access and without too much bulk .
i ran a couple of searches on the forum but did n't turn up much .
as i search i will try to update this post with options i find .
in terms of dimensions the canon site tech sheet lists them as : dimensions ( w x h x d ) 3.65 x 2.32 x 1.02 in .
/ 92.6 x 58.8 x 25.9 mm straight from canon the psc - 55 : the amazon reviews for using it on the 870 are not inspiring but you 'd think canon 's own case would work .
