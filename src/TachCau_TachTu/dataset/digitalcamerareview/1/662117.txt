880 vs 970 ... last 2 choices .
well i 'm going to pick up my camera this weekend , i really ca n't decide between these 2 cameras ... is the 970 really worth the extra money ?
which of the 2 has the wider lens ?
i read both reviews , but i 'm not sure how to tell .
... well any input anyone can provide on these 2 cameras ( most likely andy ) is greatly appreciated .
