question about canon powershot g10 .
i was looking at the powershot g10 in best buy today , and i had never heard of it before until i saw it in the store .
i 've been looking for a ' prosumer ' type compact ( something in between a point - and - shoot and a dslr ) , and i was leaning towards the panasonic dmc - lx2 ( except for the fact that you ca n't find them anywhere ) .
anyway , in the reviews of the g10 online , they said that the ring around the lens can be removed , allowing you to add an adapter for use with filters and other lenses .
so , i was just curious if any g10 owners had done this , and have any opinions on it .
thanks for any help !
p.s. also , feel free to suggest any other prosumer compact cameras .
p.p.s. alright , one more question - what 's the largest print size ( with high quality ) that can be obtained with the g10 's 15 megapixels ?
