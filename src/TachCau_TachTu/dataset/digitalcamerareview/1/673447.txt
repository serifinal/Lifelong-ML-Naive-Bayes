which canon to buy ? .
i 'm having a hard time deciding which canon is right for me .
i would love an slr but simply can not afford it but would like the next best thing .
i have kids so i would like a movie mode camera and something that takes fast , clear pictures .
i have it narrowed between 3 models : the canon sx210is , canon g11 , and canon sx20 is .
i really like the flip lcd screens and the hd movie mode but i do n't want that to outweigh the fact i want clean crisp pictures !
any suggestions ?
