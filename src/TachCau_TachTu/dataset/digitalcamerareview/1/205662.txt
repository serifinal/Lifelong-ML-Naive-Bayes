[ suggestions ? ]
accessories for sd500 .
hi all , my new sd500 is on the way and i am looking for suggestions about accessories .
i bought a 2g sd card already .
anything else ?
ps : i want to buy a high capacity battery , because the review on canon battery life is not good .
could you recommend some for me ?
shall i buy the an extra one that is exactly the same as the original one ?
is there any better choice ?
( i already spent too much on this camera , so really need something with good price value ) .
thanks .
