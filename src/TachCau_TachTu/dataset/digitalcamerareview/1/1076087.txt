how prominant is this e18 lense error issue now ? .
hello i have an old digital we rc ' vd as a incentive gift from work its a kodak easy share 4mp !
i need to upgrade but cant get what i want which would be a dslr since i used to amatuer photography with my old nikon 6006 slr 35 mm .
anyway ... im using a gift card to put toward a digital camera and decided on either the canon powershot sd 790is or the 1100is .
but ... i found so many things googling about the e18 error thing im thinking maybe not ?
im disapointed as a canon is what id wanted because my scanner and printer are awesome i just thought hey why not the canon cameras .
how prevalent is this issue now ?
thanks for info ... ps : any comparable cameras in that price range ( 200 or less ) of other makes then ?
i want macro and optical zoom , and stablization .
video camera feature would be nice too not to fancy tho ' .
thanks
