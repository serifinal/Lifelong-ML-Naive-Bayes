canon rebel xt .
i have a canon rebel xt for about a year now .
i love using it , but for some reason the lighting on the pictures is n't as good as it used to be .
i use it on automatic settings most of the time , but the lighting sucks indoor during the day and night .
does anyone have the same problem ?
or did i change something on the camera accidentally ?
any input would be helpful !!!
thanks
