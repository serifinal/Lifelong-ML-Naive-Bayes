canon sx10 grainy photos .
i am having problems with grainy photos .
i have the camera in shutter priority mode so i can take pictures of my son , who is very active .
the pictures are not blurry any longer but now they are grainy .
how do i get crisp pictures ?
this only happens when taken inside with the flash .
thanks
