sx230 high speed burst only gives the first photo .
when i use " high speed burst " and shoot a half - dozen photos , then look at the pictures , only the first picture is shown .
i switched " group images " to " off . "
i downloaded the photos to iphoto and only the first photo of each burst downloads .
i read the manual and followed the steps but i ca n't get this feature to work .
any suggestions ?
