anti-glare coating coming - off lcd screen .
i have been using a canon sd 500 elph since march .
suddenly , the anti-glare coating that gives the lcd screen a purplish tint , is coming off .
i am very gentle with the screen and it was never scratched .
i keep it in a soft case at all times .
it is coming - off in thin areas rather than in large areas .
canon wants me to send it in for repairs but i have no back - up camera in the meantime so i can not return it .
i do n't know why they spray a coating on it anyway .
my eyeglasses likewise were sprayed with an anti-glare coating and also came off but that took 5 years !
