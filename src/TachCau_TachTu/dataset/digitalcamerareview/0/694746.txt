canon s5 is .
hi , not sure if this is the right place for ??? my canon s5 is is about 3 yrs old and is very frequently showing " lens error " and says shut off .
most of the time it will not correct itself .
a day later it works fine for a few shots then message pops in at bottom and screen goes gray .
this happens most often when i am zooming in .
is this fixable .... for a reasonable amount or should i give up on camera ??? thanks , any advice would be appreciated .
