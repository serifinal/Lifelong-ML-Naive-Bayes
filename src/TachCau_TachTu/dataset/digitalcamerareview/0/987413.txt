problem with canon powershot sd 1100 , help !!! .
i bought canon powershot sd 1100 is in the u.s. a week ago .
i brought the camera to europe and after getting the battery charged and then taking a few pictures and movies out of the blue the camera stops working .
i mean i took picture of a building and i do nt really remember did i turn if off my self or it turned of by its self , but i do know when wanted to turn it on again it did not want to turn on .
i kept pressing the turn on button and even holding it for periods of time but it did nt turn on .
now i checked if the problem was with the batter or the memory card but both of them work fine in my other digital camera .
i even recharged the battery but nothing again .
then i cleaned the battery ports on the battery and in the camera but nothing .
i was wondering if the camera its self has a reset button to press it and all my worries go away please if anyone knows what should i do with this problem , help me ?
i am kind of pissed of cuz its a brand new camera .
i was thinking of taking it to service center but here in serbia i do nt think they would fix it for free ?
so yet again if anyone can help , please ?
thanks and can i get the answer asap .
