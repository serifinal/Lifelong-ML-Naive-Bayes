zoom button really hard to push back & forth .
i have a canon sd960is .
the zoom is in the same location as the shutter button but you push it left or right to zoom in or out .
i 'm thinking that i must have gotten something on in when i went out a few weeks ago .
it 's never been hard to press back and forth but now it 's very difficult .
i 'm wondering if it would be safe to get a wet q - tip or something and try to clean it ... also there 's a lot of times when i go to take a picture and i hold the shutter button down and the red light comes on like it 's going to take the picture but it wo n't .
sometimes i even have to do this two or three times before it will finally take the picture .
it 's very annoying , especially for the price i paid for this .
i have a cheaper digital elf i bought a few years ago that takes pictures way faster .
