canonsd750 picture lag question .
hello , i have had my first digital camera -lrb- sd750 -rrb- for about two weeks now and have read the manuals cover to cover numerous times and done lots of experimenting .
i figured out that i do n't have a lag taking the shot if i hold down my shutter to focus ... then compose & shoot .
but it still takes what seems like forever to take my next shot because the picture i have just take displays on the lcd screen forever !
what setting have i overlooked that can be changed to shorten and/or eliminate the display of the photo just taken ?
thank in advance .
