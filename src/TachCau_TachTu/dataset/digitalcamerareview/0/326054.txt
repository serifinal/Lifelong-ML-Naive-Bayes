what 's the problem with my s2 is ? .
hi , after one year i decided to use my canon s2 is , but i noticed every time i took picture , it was completely black , so i thought maybe it 's a stuck shutter problem.i took many pictures ( and also hit the camera several times with my hand ) and suddenly the problem went away .
but this time when i take pictures it acts in a strange way.i do n't know if there 's a problem with it 's lens or sensor or it 's dirty or something else ?!
i put some pictures here , so you may be able to help me with this .
can i repair it myself ?
i 'm in a hurry and should get it fixed in 2 or 3 days and no camera repair shop or anything else is around here .
thank you for your help note : all pictures are directly from camera and they are cropped to reduce size indoor - fluorescent lamp - automatic : you see horizental lines http://forum.digitalcamerareview.com...1&d=1313997777 indoor - fluorescent lamp - aperture priority ( same as above but with aperture more than 5.0 ) : green tint and those lines http://forum.digitalcamerareview.com...1&d=1313997842 outdoor - sunny day - automatic : it 's like camera ca n't recognize the amount of light : overexposure and maybe the lines http://forum.digitalcamerareview.com...1&d=1313997816 but sometimes in ideal conditions ( light ) it can take good pictures !?
