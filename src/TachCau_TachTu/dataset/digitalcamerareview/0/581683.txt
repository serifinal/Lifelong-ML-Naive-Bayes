conversion lens adapter @regular lenses .
i just bought the la-dc 58g lens adapter and a conversion ring -lrb- 58-55mm -rrb- to go with my canon a710is camera .
i have a set of vivitar 55mm close-up lenses -lrb- 4-2-1 -rrb- which i have used on my older minota xd-11 , but i would like to see how they work on my new camera .
if i use these regular lenses in the ` manual ' mode , what kind of problems will i encounter ?
will i be able to get any satisfactory results ?
i would like to try these lenses before spending money on the canon macro lens 250d .
john
