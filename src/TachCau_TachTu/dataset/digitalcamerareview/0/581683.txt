conversion lens adapter @regular lenses .
i just bought the la - dc 58g lens adapter and a conversion ring ( 58 - 55 mm ) to go with my canon a710is camera .
i have a set of vivitar 55 mm close - up lenses ( 4 -2-1 ) which i have used on my older minota xd - 11 , but i would like to see how they work on my new camera .
if i use these regular lenses in the ' manual ' mode , what kind of problems will i encounter ?
will i be able to get any satisfactory results ?
i would like to try these lenses before spending money on the canon macro lens 250d .
