powershot sd4000 is / general question , " shutter mode problem " .
hi , this is more of a general question for those with powershot and shutter mode experience .
i 'm using shutter mode and i set it to 1/1250 which is the highest speed possible on my sd4000 is / 300 hs .
i tried with auto iso and iso 3200 .
no flash were used .
in both cases , the camera does its own ( auto ) shutter speed and goes much slower such as 1/60 or 1/4 .
what am i doing wrong , perhaps in the settings ?
when i use aperture mode , it does exactly as i say with the aperture set but for some reason in shutter mode , it keeps doing its own auto speed . .
