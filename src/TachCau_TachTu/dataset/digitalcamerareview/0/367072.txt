canon sx100 is power issues .
hello .
i bought a canon powershot sx100 is about 6 months ago and literally used it for maybe 200 pictures , a few weeks .
one day i 'm snapping then the batteries seem to die .
when i go to change them -lrb- the batteries were n't dead btw -rrb- , the camera only turns on for a split second then turns off .
i changed the cell battery ; still nothing .
i do some research and find out that there may be internal problems with power distribution on the camera .
here 's the problem , since it was brand new i was on warranty , however i can not find the receipt nor will the retailer take it back as it came from the now defunct circuit city .
contacting canon has seemed to be next to impossible .
does anyone have any suggestions on either contacting canon regarding the issue or with help in fixing it ?
