fixing my old sd1000 ? .
about a year and a half ago i bought a sd1000 on sale .
due to moving and other considerations , its been sitting in a closet for about a year .
i decided to dust if off and use it as a solid / cheap point and shoot .
problem is that all of the pictures are fuzzy and out of focus .
i though it might just be a smudge so i wiped the lens off with my lcd cleaner and microfiber cloth ( before realizing that may not be the proper way to go ) .
it did n't really change anything .
so my question is if i can somehow fix this cheaply / at home or if i need to start looking into some black friday deals .
was n't sure where to ask this so any help would be appreciated .
