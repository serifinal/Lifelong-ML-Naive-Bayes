help with focusing .
i 'm enjoying my new sx110 but i 'm having a hard time getting crisp clear focusing in two situations .
1 .
up-close objects .
sometimes they come out clear but often they are blurry .
i 've tried the auto as well as portrait and a couple other settings both with and w/o flash but i havent been able to figure the most optimal way to use the camera for taking pictures of close objects .
2 .
pictures of my baby who is never quite perfectly still .
i tried the `` kids and pets '' setting but that doesnt seem to do the trick .
any guidance would be greatly appreciated !
