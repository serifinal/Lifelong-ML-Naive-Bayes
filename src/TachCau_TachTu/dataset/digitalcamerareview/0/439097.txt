d10 aperture / shutter shooting waves .
hello i 've been using my d10 to take shots of breaking waves http://www.flickr.com/photos/dumbat/4239403524/ http://www.flickr.com/photos/dumbat/4238629473/ http://www.flickr.com/photos/dumbat/4279442703/ ideally i would like a fast shutter speed , and preferrably a small aperture .
so far i have been using p mode and pushing the iso up so that the camera will compensate by tending towards the settings i want .
but of course that results in lots of nasty noise ( i also use exposure compensation to stop it down because in the lag between light metering and shutter opening the breaking wave usually gets a lot whiter ) i would be interested to hear if anyone else has other tips .
for example do any of the auto scene modes work well ?
cheers noop
