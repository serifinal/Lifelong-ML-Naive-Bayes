lighting for eos 5d ? .
i intend to shoot portrait photos with a canon eos 5d , could any one recommend a ideal strobe lighting set for this .
a link for showing what is it the set , list what they think is best .
something like that .
the more detailed the better .
better yet , any one with a canon eos 5d that shoots portrait photography .
if they would be so kind to list their lighting equipment .
the more detailed the better also is their a 10 second delay feature for taking a picture with that camera ?
i am also using a chromakey green screen for the background , does this affect the lighting ?
many thanks to all those that participate !
