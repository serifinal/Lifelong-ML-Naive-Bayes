i understand that the new canon xs is now available .
i was browsing some camera sites looking for the new canon xs and noticed that the camera is apparently available online .
i called best - buy and circuit city to see if they had any in the stores to check out personally and none had any .
any word on when they would be available in stores ?
thanks ,
