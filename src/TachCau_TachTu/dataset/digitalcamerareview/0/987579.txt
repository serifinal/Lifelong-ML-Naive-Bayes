difficulty getting good depth - of - field pictures .
i am using a canon early rebel with a ef 17 - 40 mm lens and am having trouble getting pictures with a good range of " in - focus " for subjects where lighting is good , but even with extreme manual settings , i can not keep a subject from 6ft to 20 feet in focus throughout .
can anyone help me with recommending a lens , that has excellend depth - of - field , or technique ?
my movie camera has a small lens that does a much better job of depth - of - field than i can do with my canon .
thanks .
