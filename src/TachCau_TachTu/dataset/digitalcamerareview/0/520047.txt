canon 1000d good news : .
apparently it clearly beats the a200 , d60 & e420 on high - iso iq ; actually even in the lower isos .
and this is on both luminance * and * chrominance noise .
what more if the 1000d 's in - camera high iso chroma nr is turned on .
http://www.infoborder.com/digital_ca.../eos_1000d.php the 1000d also appears to have better per - pixel sharpness than the other 3 cameras in both jpeg & raw .
http://www.infoborder.com/digital_ca...1000d.php#feat the above could be evidence that the 1000d has a tweaked 10mp sensor compared to the one used on the 400d ( or at least the in - cam image processing has gotten better with respect to nr ) and that it has a weaker aa filter .
the review also confirms that the a200 & d60 's ( same 10mp sony ccd sensor ) iso3200 firmware - boost is nothing more than a marketing gimmick that is hardly usable =p .
