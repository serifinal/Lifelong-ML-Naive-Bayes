canon sx10 is macro help .
i 've shot some wonderful macro shots .
most of which are in the direct sunlight .
some though do come out in shade and low light .
it seems as though its a hit and miss kind of thing .
seems it has to do with the lighting .
my question is what is the best way to shoot low light macros either indoors or out without a bunch of noise ?
the pictures generally look good when shooting them or reviewing them on the camera .
once i go and review them on 100 % they are pretty noisy .
also , my dof is sometimes a little off .
i am an newbie , and still experimenting .
thanks .
