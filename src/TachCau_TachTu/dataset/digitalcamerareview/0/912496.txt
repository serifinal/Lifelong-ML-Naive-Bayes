interesting display phenomenon .
wearing a good pair of polarized sunglasses while playing around with our new sx200is at the local dog park , i thought i had a problem with the display .
viewed in the " landscape " orientation , the display was great .
viewed in the " portrait " orientation , my display went dark .
once i took off the polarizing glasses , everything was fine .
obviously .
the problem was the glasses ... i wonder if the display is polarized itself ?
