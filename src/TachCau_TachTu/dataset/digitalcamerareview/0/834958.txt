during daytime , the hypercrystal lcd remains bright and clear , even in direct sunlight , due to an additional layer in the screen that reflects light away from any external light source .

the bright capture technology allows easier framing of low light scenes since the lcd preview remains bright enough to see the subject .
the bright capture technology also minimizes blur as the increased sensitivity can allow faster shutter speeds .
