t - adapter for g12 ? .
i sold all my slr stuff a couple of decades ago .
too much stuff .
have been using various canon elf cameras since .
bought myself a canon g12 for christmas .
i like it .
it seems to be a good step between an elf and a full dslr .
now , i 'm playing with it .
fun .
question : i 'd like to adapt my celestron c8 .
is it possible ?
is there a t - adapter mount ?
thanks in advance .
