re : canon powershot sx130 is review discussion .
i am loving my canon powershot sx130is !
i upgraded from the a590 , which i wish still worked , because it was perfect in it 's own way ... but this sx130is is so fun .
i hear you guys on the battery issues .
if you plan on doing hd video , you 'd better have like 8 nimh 's that you think are fully charged , cause that 's the main drain .
even if you think you have fully charged batteries , you might go dead and have to swap out right away .
interestingly , it does n't drain power so fast when recording in the miniature mode .
it does n't take nearly as much space on your memory card either .
probably cause theres no audio and less visual information , frames ... i have n't seen anyone show an example of the tilt - shift mini mode , so i 'll link a video at the end of this post .
i think it 's one of the coolest features on the camera .
also , color accent is great !
it 's an eyedropper tool !
easy to learn to use it .
you just zoom in on your desired color and select it .
you can get super creative .
the color swapping is cool to , but i have n't used it much beyond turning the sky red once .
might be just me , but auto mode always seems washed out so i keep it in super vivid most of the time .
we can post photos in these forums , right ?
i 'd love to see what others are doing with their sx130is 's .
i hear it 's becoming a very popular camera world wide .
i see a lot of japanese people have it , from the videos they post on youtube .
here is my example of mini mode .
