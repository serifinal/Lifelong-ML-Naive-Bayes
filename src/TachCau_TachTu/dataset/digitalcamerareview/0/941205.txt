s5 is help ?? .
hey guys , i just bought the s5 is .
i had the original s1 , and it got stolen , after which i bought the s2 , which also got stolen ( talk about bad freakin luck ! )
anyways , i liked both of them so much that i got the s5 .
mainly , i like this camera because of it 's capability to record video .
now , with the s1 and s2 , i had no problems dragging the video files right off the camera or card onto my desktop and viewing them .
however , with the s5 , i do so , and the videos can not be viewed .
all the photos are fine , but i ca n't open videos .
the closest i 've gotten has been to open the video in vlc ( which can repair them on a one - time basis ) , and the software that comes with the camera . .
but i want to put them into an editing program and be able to work with them ( makes sense , right ? )
... so now i 'm screwed .
is there something i 'm screwing up ?
i do n't know why they 'd change the system since the last cameras .
if it helps , my friend has the same issue , with the same model .
it 's not just mine .
i 'm running windows vista home on a intel core2duo 2.0 ghz processor , and i 've tried it on my laptop which is similar but with 2.5 ghz .
anyone else running into this ?
let me know , thanks !
