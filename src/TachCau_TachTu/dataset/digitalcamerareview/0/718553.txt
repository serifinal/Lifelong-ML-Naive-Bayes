battery life sd800 is .
just purchased this camera .
do you think the battery will last a day or shooting pictures , say on vacation ?
will i need to recharge every day ?
i had a nikon a few years ago that ate batteries , it was horrible .
i 'm hoping this new canon will be better .
this may be a simple question , but not very camera savy here
