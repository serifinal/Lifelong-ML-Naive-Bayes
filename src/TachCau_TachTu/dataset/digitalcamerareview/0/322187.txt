putting date on photos .
hi , i just recently bought a cannon sd1100is ( thanks andy for the help ! )
and i would like to know how to put the dates on the photos .
i know there is a date stamp option , but i would like to put the dates on photos i already took and have to option to put on / take off .
is there any way i can put dates on the photos i already took ?
thanks !
oh does anyone know how common the e18 lens error is ?
does every camera have this possibility or just a few bad batch cannon cameras ?
due to reading " if you are unlucky " i take it as if you get a bad batch .
oh and any way to take the reflection of glasses in photos ?
sorry for the many questions .
happy holidays everyone !
