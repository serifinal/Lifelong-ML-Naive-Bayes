replace canon powershot ds900 ? .
a few years ago i was given a canon sd 900 .
it cost about $ 500 at the time .
i love this camera .
about 6 months ago a bottle of water spilled into my purse and drained into my camera cover .
i have been sick over the loss of this camera .
there is not a local place that repairs cameras .
when i called canon the rep i spoke with sounded like it would not be worth having it repaired but that i could send it in and have the option of upgrading to a different camera ... at a cost of course .
what do you think i should do ?
send to canon ?
try to find an independent repairman ?
forget about it ?
-lrb- i make a little over minimum wage so purchasing a new camera is out of the question . -rrb-
thanks for any advice/help you can offer !
