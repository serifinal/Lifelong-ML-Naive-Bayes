no ixus ? .
im a little bit confused cause here in sweden there is a camera called " canon ixus 70 " witch i am interested in .
but when i went to this site to read about it , there wasnt any ixus 70 . .
later i clicked on a random camera on this site and came to a camera witch look very similar to the ixus 70 .
it was called canon powershot sd1000 .
my question is , is it the same camera ?
why havnt you got an ixus here on this site ?
