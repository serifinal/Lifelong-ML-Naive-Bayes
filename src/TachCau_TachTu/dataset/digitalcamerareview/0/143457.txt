canon powershot sd1300 video quality .
i purchased a canon powershot sd1300 digital camera a couple of days ago .
i 've taken some lovely pictures with it , and i 'm enjoying it very much .
a strange thing happens with the video though .
the picture is nice and clear ( though a wee bit jerky ) and the sound is very good , but the two things do n't match up : the picture lags a little behind the sound .
is this something i can fix , or is it just the way this particular camera shoots video ?
please advise .
thanks , vitaluna
