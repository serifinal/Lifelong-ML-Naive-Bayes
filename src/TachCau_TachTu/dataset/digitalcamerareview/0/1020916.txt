canon camera phone hoax .
as i keep a pretty close eye on camera news , i keep seeing the " coverage " of a canon digital slr / phone rumor on other camera sites .
the best part about it is that , as far as i can tell , the " news " started at bbspot - a known satire site .
in fact , their html title includes : " satire for smart people ; the truth for you " .
the irony is amazing .
