my thoughts on the s5 is .
i decided to get this camera as a replacement for my s1 is .
overall , i 'd say it is an improvement over my former camera , but it still has the same focusing issues that my old camera has .
perhaps i 'm missing something , so i wo n't say that i 'm unhappy with this camera .
i get some really great pictures with it .
i mostly use it for taking pictures of my baby daughter and when it focuses correctly i get some amazing pictures .
i can usually tell when it 's not going to focus correctly , but i miss a lot of pictures when i try to grab the camera and then it takes a while to get focused .
once i have it going , i can usually get a decent picture , but sometimes it takes a while before i can figure out the focusing .
i thought the color accent feature was a great idea , but i 've had some trouble getting it to work the way i wanted .
i do n't use the video feature of the camera , because i recently bought a camcorder for longer movies of her firsts , so i ca n't say anything about that .
i would say this is a good camera , and i 'm glad they added the macro feature , because my s1 is did n't have that .
it does n't do everything the way i would prefer , but it is a good camera , if you have some patience to get the focusing correct and have time to set it up without missing your shot .
