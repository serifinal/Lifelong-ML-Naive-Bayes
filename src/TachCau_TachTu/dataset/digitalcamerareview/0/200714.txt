canon sd500 initial thoughts .
now that the camera has seen some vacation time and travel i have comments .
the software is great compared to what i 've had come with other cameras .
my prints have come out great ( up to 8x10 prints ) and i love its compact size and battery life saving features ( turn off lcd , viewfinder , turn off camera automatically after certain amount of time ) build quality seems excellent as well .
i like the usb 2.0 and direct print features ( all new to me ) complaints : shots with flash have a rather long refresh rate ( between shots ) the lcd while big enough could have a better resolution its pretty fuzzy .
