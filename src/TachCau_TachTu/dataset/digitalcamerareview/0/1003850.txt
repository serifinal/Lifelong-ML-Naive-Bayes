sx100 is my colors mode - where is color accent ? .
if someone can point me to where this is in the camera , i would be most grateful .
i ca n't find it for the life of me .
the canon website says the sx100 is has this as part of my colors mode , but i do n't see it anywhere .
i bought this camera with the expectation that i could take a photo and turn it all black and white except for one portion with this feature .
here 's the link from the canon website .
