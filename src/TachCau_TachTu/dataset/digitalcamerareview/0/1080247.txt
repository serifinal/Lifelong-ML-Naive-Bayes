smoke gets in my eyes .
hi , i currently own a 1 year old canonsd880 , which performs nicely.a few days ago while taking pictures in full daylight , i 've noticed a small plume of white smoke rising from the area of the flash ( which " fired " as should ) .
this persisted for the next couple of shots and reappeared at another session later that night.upon examining the camera at the lab , no smoke was reproduced and so far no evidence of any fault can be produced .
have anyone heared of this phenomena?and how it 's been dealt with ?
thanks micha
