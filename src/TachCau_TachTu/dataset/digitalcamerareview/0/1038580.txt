sx20is fullresolution .
first time on this site and i have a question i have been able to answer .
bought a sx20 .
can anyone answer why i can not achieve a higher resolution than 3 mp ?
i am not an avid photographer and this is my first camera but would like to know if i can achieve a resolution that is closer to the the rating of the camera .
any help would be appreciated .
