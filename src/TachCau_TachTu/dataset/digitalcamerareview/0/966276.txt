lightroom / canon rebel xs download problem .
i have a canon rebel xs , and lightroom 2 on a macbook os x 10.4 .
i would like to plug the camera in ( usb ) to download my pictures .
lightroom is unable to recognize the raw files when i download direct from the camera .
if i put the card in my card reader , they import fine .
i have installed the canon cd of drivers , etc. .
does anyone else have this problem ?
is there some setting i 'm missing ?
please help .
thanks , evan
