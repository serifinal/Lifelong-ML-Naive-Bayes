photostitch copy / replacement ? .
hi , i 've lost my canon installation cd ( do n't know where , do n't know when , but i no longer have it ) .
i do n't need any of the cr_p on the cd except the photostitch to make panoramic pictures .
could anyone provide me ( in a legal fashion ) with a copy of the software / iso of the powershot a95 installation cd ?
since i own the camera i am entitled to a copy of photostitch ... on the support website only updates are available , not the installation kits themselves .
alternatively , can anyone point me to a good replacement software ?
( freeware preferably ) .
thanks , e.b.e. edit : oh by the way powershot a95 is a fine machine had one in a car accident once , the lcd backcover is bent and the zoom mechanism clicks sometimes , but it 's still working nevertheless .
4 bad pixels on the ccd but that 's to be expected after 1.5 years i presume .
