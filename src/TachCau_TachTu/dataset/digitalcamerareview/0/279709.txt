canon g12 and the la - dc58k .
i purchased a lens adapter for my new g12 with the thought that it might be a way to protect the lens and be a bit of a lens hood .
i know , the filter adapter fa - dc58b would be a better choice - it is on order .
using the la i interestingly found that at the g12 widest lens setting , the hood clipped the image .
also i found the la comes in two parts - anyone know why that is ?
i have n't found anything about that in the sparse document canon sent with the la .
thanks , tom
