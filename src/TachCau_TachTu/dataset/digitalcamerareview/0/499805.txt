canon eos 40d passes the test .
after going through multiple user evaluations , the canon eos 40d dslr passed with flying colors .
here is the low down on the canon eos 40d : the good : generally superior shooting speed among dslrs ; first - rate photo quality .
the bad : large spot size for spot meter ; relatively sluggish low - light focus .
the bottom line : great photo quality and excellent continuous - shooting performance are just two of the canon eos 40d 's many attractive features .
this would be a good choice for professional photographers to consider .
hope this helps !
