overexposed pictures ... .
i bought my canon powershot sd1200is in may ' 09 .
i purchased an ativa 4 gb memory card that was on sale at the same time to use with the camera .
my pictures have always looked overexposed ( even when i am not pointing the camera at a light source ) .
i often have to use photoshop to adjust the contrast and color , so that the pictures look decent .
is there a function that i need to adjust on the camera to correct this problem ?
could the cheap memory card be the problem ?
did i just get a faulty camera ?
any advice would be greatly appreciated .
