formatting memory cards ? .
i just got my first digital camera , canon sd 600 .
i was using it when suddenly a message appeared saying that the memory card was full .
do any digital cameras advise when the card is nearly full ?
i know my camcorders all give a 5-minute warning when the tape supply is low .
also , is it necessary to format -lrb- customize -rrb- memory cards before use ?
what is the purpose and what happens if i forget to format a new card ?
if a memory card is ejected , then re-inserted , wo n't formatting erase everything ?
the manual gives little information about formatting .
