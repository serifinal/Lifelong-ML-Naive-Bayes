scene modes / macro function ixus 800is .
have just bought an ixus 800is and been playing around .
just wondering if anyone can point me to a detailed guide on the use of the various scene modes , as well as the macro function .
i understand the basics but wanted more in depth review , eg if taking a picture of someone 's face , do i use portrait alone or do i use portrait as well as the macro function .
thanks in advance
