fujifilm finepix s100fs unveiled at midnight .
fujifilm disclosed a new addition to its s series with the top - of - the - line finepix s100fs ( film simulation ) .
touted as fuji 's most advanced digital camera to date , the s100fs is an slr - like shooting tool that brings manual controls and other advanced features to users looking for more functionality and flexibility .
a thoroughly impressive 14.3 x fujinon zoom lens and an 11 megapixel super ccd sensor are the cornerstone on which the rest of the camera builds .
fuji 's advanced rpiii processor works in conjunction with the ccd to control noise , and we 're anticipating that this combination should yield some of the best noise performance results we 've seen.on the subject of iso , the s100fs is able to shoot at iso 6400 at 6 megapixels , or all the way up to iso 10,000 at 3 megapixels .
this is simply a staggering number , and if the results look anything like a discernible image , we 'll be very impressed with the fuji 's performance.borrowing many of its tech specs from the famed fuji s5 pro , the s100fs has three dynamic range settings , allegedly extending capture by up to 400 percent at the maximum selection .
given fuji 's strong history in film , it 's not surprising that one of their flagship device would sport the company 's film simulation technology , which faithfully reproduces the look of several classic films ( like velvia and portra ) according to fuji.dual image stabilization should make the far reaches of the s100fs 's zoom more functional , and a face detection that handles faces shot at off - axis angles more confidently than many systems on the market is also a definitely plus in terms of usability.with a 2.5 - inch tiltable lcd that adjusts to a variety of shooting positions and support for both xd - picture card and the more common sd and sdhc formats , the s100fs looks like a strong contender in the premium ultra-zoom market.look for the camera in stores next month , with a price tag around $ 799 .
