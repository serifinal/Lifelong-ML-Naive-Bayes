canon needs regeneration in optics .
most of canon top models are long in tooth and need to have better specs .
s5is - i think should have a 12x zoom starting from 28 mm eq .
a series powershots need to start from 28 or 30 mm eq .
and i think canon must move all compact digital elph , s to 28 - 140 mm a la w - 150 , w - 170 from sony .
35 mm is just not wide enough wide and 28 mm is almost a must .
lots of canon clients will migrate to panasonic and sony - who have proven themselves more fleet footed !
