canon needs regeneration in optics .
most of canon top models are long in tooth and need to have better specs .
s5is - i think should have a 12x zoom starting from 28mm eq .
a series powershots need to start from 28 or 30mm eq .
and i think canon must move all compact digital elph , s to 28-140mm a la w-150 , w-170 from sony .
35mm is just not wide enough wide and 28mm is almost a must .
lots of canon clients will migrate to panasonic and sony - who have proven themselves more fleet footed !
