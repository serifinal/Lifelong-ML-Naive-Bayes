s3 is problems .
i am having a few potential issues with my camera .
- when i move the camera when its off , i hear a sound as if there is a loose screw rolling around inside .
could it be something else ?
- when the camera is on and i am zooming i hear this flickering sound .
i think it might be the auto focus adjusting .
any ideas ?
bear in mind this is my first digital camera so i am not familiar with the usual sounds of a digital camera .
thanks alot
