re : canon powershot sx20 is .
hi , ive had canon powershot sx20 is for nearly six months .
im quite happy with it .
but today i noticed that some pictures show a notable red dot in the exact same place .
depending on light or sth else , the red dot is more visible .
on other pictures i cant find it .
on some i can .
the place never changes .
so , id like to know if that is the so - called matrix fault ?
a warranty job ?
or its just something that i shouldnt care about ?
