card size .
enjoy shooting with digital , knowing pictures come out verses film , but do n't know much about the technical stuff behind the camera .
does a larger card ( 1gig or 2 gig ) make a camera faster ?
would that help my current camera , a nikon coolpix 4300 which currently i miss my daughters sports ( volleyball and soccer ) action shots because it is sooooooo slow .
i only use a 128 mb card in it .
if so , does it make it faster taking pictures ( with shutter lag ) or just time between shots , going into sleep mode , etc. .
i do notice that the more pictures i have on the card the slower it gets .
thanks !!!!!
