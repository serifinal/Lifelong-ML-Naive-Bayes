a620 help .
hi .
i have had my a620 for just a couple of months and have been primarily using it in auto mode .
i have recently started messing with the other modes ( primarily " p " , as it is the only one that i understand right now and i just wanted to be able to control the focus target ) .
when i take pictures in lowish light in " p " mode , i notice that the shutter is very slow and all pictures come out blurry , even if i use a tripod .
if i use the timer on the tripod , they are ok .
so i guess even my pressing of the button is enough to shake ?
what is odd though is that all of the options ( iso , etc ) are still set on auto .
when i switch back to " auto " mode , the pics are ok .
same subject , same light conditions .
does this make any sense ?
am i misunderstanding " p " mode ?
is there a better manual mode to use when i want everything to be auto except the focus target ?
also , i noticed that the battery level indicator no longer appears on screen .
any idea why ?
lastly , can anyone recommend a " third party " book that explains the options on this camera a little better for beginners than the canon manuals ?
thanks pk
