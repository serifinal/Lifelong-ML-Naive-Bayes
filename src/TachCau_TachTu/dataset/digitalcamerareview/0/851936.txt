suggested settings on canon ef 100 mm f2 .8 usm macro .
hey , i just got my 100 mm macro lens yesterday and i mounted it on my eos 40d .
its an awesome lens .
i have to get adapted to this lens from my ef - s 18 - 55 mm style .
for eg , i was trying to take portraits of my 3 month old .
earlier i had to be close to the bassinet .
now , with this prime lens , the focal length is fixed at 100 mm , i need to move farter to get her entire face in the frame .
i grabbed a couple of shots putting in portrait mode .
i could n't wait to go and some close - up shots of roses in my backyard .
also some ants and snails .
can someone suggest the most generic settings required .
like , for shooting portraits , use this setting on 100 mm lens .
for taking pics of insects / flowers , set this .
i read the user manual of 100 mm lens and it says some thing about setting magnification .
to do this , set the lens in mf instead of af , turn the focus ring and move camera back and forward to take a sharp pic .
but when i put the lens in af , i notice that always it settles down to 3m on the distance scale .
when should i set this scale to infinity ?
what setting should i make if i want to have a landscape with background and also subject in focus ?
my understanding is going for a higher f - numbers like f16 or f32 will give smaller dof .
how about adep ?
if i want to take the full length portrait pic of a person with this lens , and i do n't have enough room to go back away from the subject , what is the alternative ?
these kind of situations i bumped into when i switched my lens from 18 - 55 mm to 100 mm macro .
