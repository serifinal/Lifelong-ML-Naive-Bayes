canon elph 310 hs : best compact camera so far ? .
i noticed the sony wx9 and the canon elph 300 are in the top 10 october digital cameras list , but the new canon elph 310 which is becoming readily available over the last couple of weeks is better than both .
i have the wx9 and elph 300 sitting in my closet , but none have the power this compact camera has .
i bought it last monday and so far it is the best camera i have owned in a long time .
it is getting really good reviews on bestbuy and amazon and i am hoping this site here does an in - depth review since i enjoy reading them .
anyways , it has a brighter screen then its predecessor and has the almighty better optical zoom range while still maintaining a wide angle .
even the tripod socket is metal which not all cameras have , but should .
the controls are simple and quick responding movie button for full hd movie recording .
the menu button is on the side and is easy to touch by moving your index finger from the zoom ring .
the macro mode is up front on the control pad and of course the zoom works while movie making .
canon did n't add more megapixels , but 12 is plenty big for me .
i have been waiting for years for a small camera to have the features altogether that this elph 310 has .
sorry for a long read , but i am truly excited about my this camera !
a must buy .
p.s. i also bought a sandisk extreme class 10 8 gb sdhc card with 30 mb / sec transfer , so that also helps performance .
