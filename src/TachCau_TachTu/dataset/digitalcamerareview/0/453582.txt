hello , i need some help -lrb- rebel xsi -rrb- .
i just recently purchased this camera after a month of researching .
i am very new to the photo world but would like to get into it .
my problem is that when i have my camera -lrb- canon rebel xsi -rrb- in auto focus when i push the shutter button down haft way the flash will go off like 10 times then say busy , so i push it down all the way after it does all that it dosent take the shot thoe , now this it gets weird when i hold the camera upside down in the same mode -lrb- autofocus -rrb- it will take the photo just fine .
now when i hit the af button on the camera itself it has options `` one shot `` ai focus '' and `` ai servo '' when i put it on ai servo it will do it fine but i would like it on one shot please help if yall have any clue
