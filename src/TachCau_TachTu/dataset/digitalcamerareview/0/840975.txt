sd850 is ( eu : ixus 950 is ) blurry corners .
hi , i 've bought this camera for a present .
it arrived yesterday , and as soon as i started downloading pictures , i noticed something was wrong in the corners of the image when the zoom is at 0x ( max zoom out ) ( i think it 's called " wide angle " ) .
here are some examples : --- ( links removed for privacy reasons ) --- i know that , quoting from the review , quote : the canon 4x optical zoom was pretty uniformly sharp across the frame at the telephoto end , but the corners seemed just a bit soft with perhaps just a faint hint of vignetting ( darkening ) at wide angle .
but in my case the effect seems stronger and much more visible .
what do you advise ?
should i ask for a replacement ?
or is this a fault that i can expect with all these cameras ?
if i can expect a fault with high probability , i 'd rather just send the camera to my friend without wasting any more time on this ... he 's not likely to be very much affected by the fault .
if this fault is common with these cameras , i am extremely disappointed .
my 2.5 year old powershot a95 does not have any noticeable blurring in the corners , and also handles the iso noise ( much ) better in night conditions ...
