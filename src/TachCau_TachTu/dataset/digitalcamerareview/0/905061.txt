canon s2 is short battery life .
i 've been trying out the canon s2 is .
being new to using more than a point and shoot camera i 've been playing around with it and trying different things but have gone through batteries -lrb- 4 aa at a time -rrb- rather quickly .
i 've changed them twice already in about two weeks .
i have only been using the trial sd card which only holds about 10 or so pics so have been doing a lot of deleting .
the book says i should average 130 shots per set of regular batteries -lrb- more if i would use rechargable -rrb- but i do n't think i `` ve taken near that many .
does anyone else go through batteries quickly ?
does it eat more juice to delete than take pictures ?
any suggestions or advice ?
thanks !!!!
