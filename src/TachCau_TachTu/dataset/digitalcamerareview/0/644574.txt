issues with canon sx 100 is ? .
hi , i am a novice to digital cameras and have recently purchased a canon sx 100 is .
however , i find the image quality blurring -lrb- lack of focus -rrb- when i zoom a distant object in the auto mode .
the focus has to be set by 1/2 clicking the button before taking a picture .
i tried another such camera on display at circuit city and found this issue was not existing there -lrb- the camera was able to correctly focus on full zoom -rrb- .
is there some setting which i am missing or is there some defect with my camera .
would appreciate an early reply .
