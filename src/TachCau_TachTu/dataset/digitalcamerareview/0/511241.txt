canon s5 is exposure problem .
my canon s5 is experiencing an exposure problem .
when taking pictures bright light , the lcd turns much darker when gently pushing the shutter button , which results in underexposed photos .
at the same time , a soft whirring / clicking noise can be hard from the camera .
pictures taken indoors or in very low light seem to be unaffected by this problem .
has anybody experienced a similar problem ?
any ideas what to do ( apart from smashing the bloody things against the wall - this started when i was visiting the panda zoo in china ) .
