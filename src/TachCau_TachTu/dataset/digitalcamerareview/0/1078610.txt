downloading images to sd card .
i have a canon s3 is camera.i want to download images from the computer back onto the sd card .
i have reformatted the card , and photos are sent to the card , but the camera displays " no image " when trying to view them .
( they can be seen again on the computer , and so are on the card . )
is there a way to resolve this problem ?
david vernon ( scotland ) thanks for anticipated help .
