720p digic 4 processor question .
seeing that most of the new canon camera 's use the digic 4 processor , and most , if not all , have a pretty basic control when shooting 720p ( ie ca n't zoom while recording ) , does that mean that all of them have the exact same quality standard ?
for example ; do the ixus 100 is , the 110 is and ( for example ) the sx200 all output the same quality hd video ?
i 've read somewhere that the ixus 110 is has a newer lens , does that matter too ?
it 's a shame that most sites do n't elaborate more on the hd video option available nowadays , because from the footage i 've seen from the ixus 110 is ( sd960 ) it certainly beats quite a few camcorders .
