advise needed : canon a95 & a590 .
hello currently i have a functioning canon a590 , it does not take good low light pictures at all and some of the normal light pictures come out grainy as well , it supposedly has " image stabilization " but i do not see this happening with this camera .
most of my pictures are garbage ; either blurry or grainy .
it is very disappointing / frustrating to look at birthday pictures , family gathering pictures and 9 out of 10 shots are garbage .
i called canon and they informed me to send it in for examination .
my siblings thought my camera issues were " user error " but last night i was looking at old photos taken with my older camera canon a95 and low and behold ... low light pictures that are not grainy !
kid pictures that are not blurry .
unfortunately this camera is not functioning ( error e18 ? )
i was thinking of trying to have it fixed , i 'm wondering if it is worth having it fixed or look into a camera that is good for low - light ( i 've read through those threads and have noted down some of the recommendations ) i would rather not have to buy a new camera at this time ( budget reasons ) has anyone had issues with the a590 and what is the average ' life span ' of the a95 or has anyone had an a95 repaired .
thanks in advance for any advise you can give !!
