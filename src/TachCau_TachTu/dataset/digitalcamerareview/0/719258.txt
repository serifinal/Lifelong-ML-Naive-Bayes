canon power shot elph 100 hs .
i 've recently purchased my new digital camera , and i 'm still trying to learn all i can about it .
yesterday i set up some lights to try out some portait - style photographs , using 3 point lighting .
after i snapped a few photos of my daughter , i shot some video , and went through each of my iso settings because i wanted to study the results of each iso setting in that particular lighting .
when i was done with all that , i got the idea to shut off my key light and fill light , and leave just the back - light on my daughter , to try out that back - lit look you see on tv when somebody is sharing information but does n't want to be identified ( usually they 'll alter the sound of the person 's voice too ) .
the problem i wound up having , was that the camera was automatically adjusting to the darkness , and i could never quite achieve the look i was going for ( even after multiple changes to the position of the back light , which i did many times trying to get the lighting just right ) ... i only realized that the camera was adjusting this automatically , this morning , when i reviewed the video i had shot yesterday .
everytime i walked around to shut off lights and adjust the back light , the camera adjusted to the lighting levels and by the time i got back to look at the display screen , my daughters face was still clearly visible ... i have been goingthrough my owner 's manual to try to figure out how i can control this function , however ... i do n't know what this problem i 'm having , is called .
i am more than willing to spend my time learning how to fix the problem , if i can just figure out what the issue is called .
