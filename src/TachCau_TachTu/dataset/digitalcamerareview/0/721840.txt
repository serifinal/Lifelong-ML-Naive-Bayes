defective lcd screen ? .
i knew the lcd screen on the canon a720is did n't have good resolution -lrb- 115,000 pixels -rrb- but i 've discovered that it also does n't show decent color .
the colors are incorrect - for example red looks like red/orange .
also , the colors appear washed out .
fortunately , the colors look great on the computer screen .
anyone notice this ?
do i have a defective lcd screen ?
