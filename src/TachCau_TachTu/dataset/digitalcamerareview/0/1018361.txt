re : canon powershot sx20 is review .
re : canon powershor sx 20 vs sx10 dear sir , i have read carefully the very competent reviews regarding the two cameras .
i have seen that the image quality of the sx10 looks a little better ( less noise ) than the sx20 , and probably due to the fact that in the same sensor canon put more pixeles ( from 10 to 12 mp ) .
i have the following question : if i use the sx20 but with a lower resolution ( for example en " m1 " instead that with " l " ) , is it correct that the immage quality will increase ( at least reducing the problem of the noise ) so that the immage quality will be at least equal to the sx10 one ?
or this is impossible ?
thanks for your answer .
