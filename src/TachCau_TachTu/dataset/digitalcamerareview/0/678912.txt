display flicker problem .
i have a 3 year old canon powershot a85 .
it was working fine until recently it 's screen started to flicker .
it only happens while taking a picture , there are lines and the display is not still but keeps flickering .
this happens for 4 - 5 minutes and then it goes away .
the pictures come out fine though .
does anyone know why this might be happening ?
is this camera dying ?
