" locked " sd memory cards .
i have a canon sd 600 .
i can get 100 's of photos on a card but i 'm terrified of accidentally deleting all of them by pressing the wrong switch .
i have not yet purchased a pc so i ca n't download the photos for safekeeping .
after using - up a memory card and moving the lock switch down , are the photos completely safe from deletion ?
i am afraid that i might accidentally format the card , thus deleting all photos .
hopefully , formatting , as well as erasing , are disabled when the card is locked but i 'm unsure .
my question comes down to are all the photos completely protected from deletion when the card is locked ?
