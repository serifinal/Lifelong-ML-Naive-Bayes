please help me to understand how the lens works .
i have been using canon cameras for years , 35 mm and digital .
there is a change in the market , where higher end digital cameras are being made that look like , but are n't ..... dslrs .
in my ignorance , i would like to know on cameras like the g10 or the sd1000 , what the heck does it use to take a photo ????? i see a little , beeny lens on the front of both canon , dslr " look likes " , but are really point and shoot digital cameras and wonder if that is what is uses to actually take the photo .
if you look through the lcd , or the rangefinder , then some sort of estimation is being done , since we are not looking through the actual lens that takes the photo , like a slr or dslr , correct ??
please help me understand the basics of how they work in relation to the automatic settings and the actual lens that is being used to take the photo .
thanks so much .
