a570 is zoom wheel problem . .
hello , you might remember that i made a thread back in may about looking for a new camera and i decided ( with a lot of help ) on the powershot a570 is .
it 's been great , the shots look lovely and it works well in lots of conditions .
basically the camera is only responding some of the time when i try to zoom it in to things and the zoom wheel is not functioning like it was .
the camera has not been dropped or mishandled in any similar fashion , so i ca n't understand why this is occuring .
initially i thought it was doing it because i might have been too close to the subject or too low / high light or something like that .
i ca n't find a cause other than the fact the camera i really just doing it when it feels like it .
as i bought it in may it should still be under a general warranty , i also purchased a 3 year warranty from the store i bought it from , but that is invalidated once you trade it in .
is there any other way i can fix this without having to purchase a new warranty ?
thanks .
