taking photos .
i am trying to taking a shot with my a510 , but am having trouble .
the shot i want is of an object , but i want the background to be clear as well .
anyone got any tips on how to do this ?
yeah i suppose i could look in the manual , but that seems like a lot of work .
any help appreciated .
thanks .
