new to cameras . .
i 'm an electronic junky .
i like to know a lot about every type of electronic and never got to cameras .
is there a quick sum up guide some where to explain what parts of a camera make them better then others and that sort of thing and what other camera terms mean ?
two quick questions ... 1 .
when looking at cameras , what does the image sensor ex ( 1/2 .3 - inch ) mean to me ?
2 .
when it says on the lens , 38 - 114 mm what does this mean ?
what numbers are better ?
