g10 - controlling depth of field .
at one time we had our own color darkroom and did wedddings and senior pictures .
now after years of film cameras i purchased a canon g10 for my wife .
a neighbor wants her to take her daughter 's senior pictures and we are having trouble controlling the depth of field .
in my old pentax k2 dmd i used an 85 mm 1.8 that worked perfect for portraits .
( i do n't remember what i used on the mamiya rb67 it has been so long . )
i used almost exclusively vericolor film .
we have tried the manual settings using the 2.8 aperture in an attempt to shorten the dof ( iso 80 to enhance image quality ) and whatever shutter speed that will give us a proper exposure but we ca n't seem to get any difference .
everything still has far too much depth of field .
also she had tried different zoom values .
is this camera capable of giving what i routinely got with my filmcameras ?
thanks james
