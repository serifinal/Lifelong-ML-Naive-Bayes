sound lens ixus 65 .
hello , i recently bought a canon ixus 65 , powershot sd630 .
as i 'm fairly new to digital photography and i had problems with the lens on a kodak easyshare v530 -lrb- it would n't retract anymore -rrb- i would like to ask if it is normal that the lens on the canon makes a light mechanical or rattling sound when you focus on an object ?
i might be looking for problems that are n't there , but i would really like to be sure that this camera is 100 % ok .
thanks for any help .
kind regards , peter
