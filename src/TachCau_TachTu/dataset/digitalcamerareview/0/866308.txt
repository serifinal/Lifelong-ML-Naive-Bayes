canon 400 eos - rattle .
hi , just purchased the above , and found that there is a rattle , like something loose inside if i rock the camera gently backwards and forwards .
apart from being exceptionally annoying , the camera seems to work ok .
should i be worried , and is this typical ?
just makes the build feel cheap .
