?
about canon powershot sx10 is auto iso shift .
have read the manual about this but still a bit confused about a few things .
one must press both buttons together ?
is there another way to reduce camera shake ?
i take mostly pics of birds outside of my windows and for the most part keep the setting on auto .
thanks for any help !
