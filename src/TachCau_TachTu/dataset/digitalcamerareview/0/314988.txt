the sp-570 's shadow adjustment technology provides on-board dynamic range compensation , bringing out detail and definition in underexposed areas without overexposing highlights , and with a maximum iso of 6400 the sp-570 has the specs , at least , to perform well in low light.the sp-570 uz will be available in march , for a suggested price of around $ 499.99 .
