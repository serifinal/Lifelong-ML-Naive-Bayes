canon sd1200 - program the old auto ? .
i have a question about the canon sd1200 's program mode .
is it really the old auto mode that i had in my previous camera ( canon a710 ) ?
for example , if i were to leave the camera in program mode with the iso and awb set to auto and no particular scene selected , would it essentially be the same as auto mode on my previous camera ?
the sd1200 's auto mode is really a smart auto mode , where in addition the normal automatic settings that i 've been used to , it also selects a scene setting .
the auto mode also operates the image stabelization continuously ( i had it set to shoot only on my previous camera , which i can still do in program mode now ) .
i 've noticed that while in auto mode , the camera makes a lot of adjustments between photos , and i hear a lot of little mechanical sounds .
it does n't seem to do that in program mode until i half way press the shutter button to compose the photo .
so , i 'm thinking that program mode might save battery life too .
any thoughts ?
thanks !
