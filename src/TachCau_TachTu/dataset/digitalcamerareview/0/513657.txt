sx30 is the best for taking photos from 512 - yards away .
for law enforcement purposes , i need to take clear photos of suspects from over 500 - yards away .
and since i hand - off my photos to others in the field , i need to print my photos on a portable printer with no opportunity for computer software enhancements .
for budgetary and practical purposes , the camera also needs to be light in weight , inexpensive and simple to use .
while hunting for the best camera meeting my above criteria , i compared the canon sx10is , fujifilm hs10 , nikon p100 , panasonic fz100 and canon sx30is compact zoom lens cameras .
i compared these cameras by taking photos of students from 512 and 514 - yards .
i measured the distance with a bushnell yardage pro .
i received the best iq of the students from my sx10is set at 20x zoom + 4x digital zoom and mounted with a 1.7 x tcon teleconversion lens .
i mounted the tcon - 17 to the sx10 's and sx30 's 52 mm lens filter threads using a 52 mm to 55 mm step up ring .
someone pointed out to me that these are not actually filter threads , but concentric circles , but they accept my step up ring very nicely .
although i found that the sx30is gives me better iq than the hs10 , p100 and fz100 at distances over 500 - yards , the iq of the sx10is with a tcon - 17 teleconverter attached is still slightly better than the sx30is at these extreme ranges .
too bad the tcon - 17 does not work well on the sx30is .
with today 's technology , we ca n't expect any one camera to be everything to everyone , so if you need a camera to take a closeup photo of a war painted tribal chief eating roasted grasshoppers off a banana leaf under triple canopy in low light for a national magazine , then you probably should be packing a nikon d3x or canon mark iv together with your new canon sx30is or older sx10is mounted with a tcon - 17 .
finaly here is a zoom simulator where you can try sx30 ( you can zoom with + / - or mouse wheel ) : canon powershot sx30 is test - simulator
