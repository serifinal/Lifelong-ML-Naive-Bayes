canon d10 .
i purchased a canon d10 on ebay from hot digital usa .
this camera is rated to 10 meters underwater .
it is endorsed by most diving organizations and diving magazines , internationally .
i purchased this camera brand new and on first use it leaked in one meter of water .
i have been to canon , written emails to customer care , canon sa and canon america .
the response is pathetic as not to be expected from a ' professional global company .
i have invoices and all necessary documentation and see no reason why this camera is not immediately replaced .
i thought i was dealing with a reputable company and am deeply disappointed in their response ( or lack thereof ! ) .
that their camera is not tested and should leak in the first case is wrong , their response to this is criminal .
