focusing problems with my canon rebel xsi .
i have had this camera for about a year now and it worked great for several months .
however , the last 4 months with this camera has been a nightmare because i can no longer focus consistently .
when i first purchased the camera i am almost positive i could focus on an object at any distance .
obviously if an object was far away i could only zoom to a certain point , but the camera would zoom as close as it could and take the picture .
now if i try to zoom in on an object at a distance the camera will not focus enough to take the picture in auto mode .
i can manually take the picture , but the picture is fuzzy .
for instance , if i am across a room and try to zoom in on my son on the other side the camera will not focus and take the picture .
