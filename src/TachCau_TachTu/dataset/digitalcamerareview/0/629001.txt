powershot sx100 is -- dead .
help ! .
i 've got a sx100 , 1 yr 9m old , that simply wo n't go on .
no damage , no liquid , no nothing -- one day it worked , took a photo , next day would n't go on .
only thing that happened in between was i took out the memory card to download the photo i took ; standard procedure , no different than any other time i did it .
batteries have been changed , terminals have been cleaned , nothing seems broken .
any ideas ?
thanks .
