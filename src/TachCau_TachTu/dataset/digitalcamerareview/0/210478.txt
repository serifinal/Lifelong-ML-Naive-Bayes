canon sx30is close ups .
i am pretty new to photography & have a couple questions .
i am using a canon sx30is to take close up shots of rare coins .
i have experimented with the camera 's macro mode and manual focus but i keep getting grainy , washed out pics w/o much detail .
the camera is on a tripod , approximately 6-8 inches from the subject & i am using a light tent for diffusion and two external white lights .
i suspect the problem has to do with camera settings but i know very little about how to set up a camera for those conditions .
can someone suggest how to set up the sx30is for sharp , detailed close ups ?
thanks .
