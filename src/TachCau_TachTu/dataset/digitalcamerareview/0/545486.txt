what i have learned about the canon 50d .
well i have had time to start getting into how the canon 50d works with the 18 - 200 mm lens system .
first off i have found if you are not using a tripod , less zoom is better .
hand shake is your picture taking enemy .
canons anti shake stabilizer system helps but it can do just so much .
getting closer and cutting back on zoom example from 200 to 185 really did wonders to picture sharpness .
also i have found that if you are shooting into a well lighted area and there are over hanging items that the lens picks up as a dark area , the little flash pops up and flash 's when you shoot .
not something i wanted to happen .
i am really getting to like this canon camera it has a lot going for it i feel .
as i progress deeper into the learning process i will report my new to a dslr finding .
anyone wishing to add something i welcome it .
