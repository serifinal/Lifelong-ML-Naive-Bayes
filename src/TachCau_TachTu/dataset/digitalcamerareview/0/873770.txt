canon s3 / kingston 1 gb problems -- help ! .
okay , so i went on a trip to san francisco , took about 300 + pics on my kingston card , then the batteries died .
afterwards it said that the card was full , yet when i tried to review the photos , the buffer light would flash for a while before returning with `` no images '' .
looking through the format option , i found that it recognized 890 mb currently being used .
i did not format .
now that i 'm home , my computer wo n't even read the card .
when i insert it into my computer 's sd slot , the autoplay buffer box comes onto the screen , then nothing .
i try exploring it only to find that it does n't recognize the card to even be present .
anybody have help/suggestions ?
