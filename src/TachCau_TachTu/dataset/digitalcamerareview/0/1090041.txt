canon powershot sd4500 / ixus 1000 hs / ixy 50s owners .
hi i ran across this video on youtube depicting a white line at the bottom of full hd video 's .
i tried it out myself and there it was unfortunately .
it doesnt appear when replaying on the camera itself , but when you download it onto the comp and look at it , its there .
here is a great example courtesy of the youtube user called `` kalseyed '' youtube - canon powershot sd4500 is -lrb- zoom test -rrb- is this a random issue or is there a fix ?
thanks
