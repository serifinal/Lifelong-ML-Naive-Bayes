new to canon .
was on the forums in the kodak area .
bought a v1253 ; it broke in a week .
got a second one and it lasted just a little longer .
do n't want to trash a mfg but , will say i am much happier with my canon sd950is .
is a great camera !
looking forward to being a part of this forum and learning from you all .
