can not see lcd screen in sunlight .
am i the only 1 was this problem ?
i can not see the lcd screen out of doors .
i have tried brightening the screen and even using my hand to block the sunlight , but to no avail .
most of my photos are either off-center or are ruined .
how do you guys use the screen ?
indoors or on cloudy days , there 's no problem .
i am tired of getting home and having to delete most of my snapshots .
