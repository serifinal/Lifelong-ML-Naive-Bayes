good rating for canon sd950 .
love it !
along with my compact zooms and a dslr , i 've owned a casio ex-z750 and ex-z1050 .
i loved the 750 , but the 1050 was a big disappointment in the image department .
i find that detail is fuzzy and the exposures can be inconsistent .
it 's still a good snapshop camera , so i gave it to a friend in need .
after being a lot more careful in comparing and looking at actual images posted around the web i chose the sd950 .
here are some video reviews : http://www.infoborder.com/digital_ca...hotsd950is.php boy , am i happy with this camera !
everything i 've taken so far has been great - from inside flash shots to outside panoramas and macro shots .
what a terrific all-around compact camera .
it wo n't replace my other cameras , but makes a great camera i can take anywhere and depend on getting really good images .
i ca n't say enough good things about it .
problems : i wish the battery could be charged without taking it out of the camera - casio 's docking cameras were really great .
