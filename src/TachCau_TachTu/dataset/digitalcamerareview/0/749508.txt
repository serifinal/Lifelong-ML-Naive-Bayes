canon powersot sx130 is megapixel pic ? .
i have just purchased this camera and it states a 12 meg picture ?
when the pictures are taken and viewed , the largest pixel may only be around 3 meg ?
all of the settings are correct for a 4000x3000 and fine ( shoot high quality images ) .
as an example , when viewing properties of a picture on the camera , the picture indicates " 12m 4000x3000 " but show 1.88 mb ?
why does n't it take a 12 mb picture ?
thanks for anyone 's help in advance .
