canon sx110 is battery indicator .
hi , i bought a new canon sx110is 2 weeks ago .
when placing my fully charged energizer nimh 2500mah batteries in it , i get the low battery signal right away .
when placing the same batteries in my old sony digital cameras , the battery indicator shows they are fully charged ... is this a problem with my canon or the batteries ?
