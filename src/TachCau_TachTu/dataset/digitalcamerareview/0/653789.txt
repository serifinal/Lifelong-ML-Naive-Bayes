canon s3 is problem with zoom lever .
hi , my canon powershot s3 is started to shut down whenever i use the zoom lever .
( for instance when i zoom in , the camera shuts down without any alert ... ) this happens not only in the photo taking mode but also in the photo play mode .
the same issue : as i am previewing a photo if i use the zoom lever to get closer , the camera goes off .
when i start the camera on the play mode while the lens is totally off this goes on happening .
i tried this with different sets of batteries , different sd cards and the scenario is the same .
did anyone had a similar problem ?
do you have any suggestions ?
this problem yields the camera nearly disfunctional and i was not planning to buy a new camera until next year .
thanks in advance and best regards ,
