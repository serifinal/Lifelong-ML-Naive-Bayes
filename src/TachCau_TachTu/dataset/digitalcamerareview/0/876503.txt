basic questions about settings . .
hi folks , i am new to photography and i bought a digital camera -lrb- sx 110 is -rrb- few weeks ago and i started shooting things without changing settings a lot .
and also i used to browse a particular website where a lot of pictures have been posted and they have mentioned certain settings that they made before shooting such picture/s .
but i dont understand much about those settings much .
could anyone please explain me the following stuff which they have mentioned under 4 photgraphs : 1st picture : http://www.pbase.com/craigsyd/image/109695254 1/320s f/4 .0 at 25.2 mm iso80 2nd picture : http://www.pbase.com/craigsyd/image/109695259 1/1000s f/4 .0 at 6.7 mm iso80 3rd picture : http://www.pbase.com/craigsyd/image/109695271 1/640s f/4 .0 at 9.1 mm iso80 4th picture : http://www.pbase.com/craigsyd/image/109695275 iso 200 my question is , if they had changed the iso what would happen to the picture , how would the picture look like .
same with `` f '' value .
and the first attribute metioned here -lrb- 1/320 & 1/1000 -rrb- .
i doubt whether i am asking a stupid question .
much appreciated and thanks a lot .
suresh .
