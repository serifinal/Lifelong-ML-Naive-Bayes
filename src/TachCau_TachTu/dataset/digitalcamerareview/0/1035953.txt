7d is on third place now ! .
upgraded from 30d .
very happy with new autofocus speed , accuracy , and tracking ability .
excited about new features : remote flash control , 100 % view , hd video , and high iso image quality .
i had been looking for a used 1d markiii when the 7d was announced and jumped on it saving me a lot of money .
it has what i need for sports shooting and a lot more for a reasonable price .
i 'm getting a lot more in - focus keepers with more cropping overhead , plus about a 2 stop high iso advantage from the 30d .
i think third place on the " best dslr of 2009 " is not bad result very pleased so far !
