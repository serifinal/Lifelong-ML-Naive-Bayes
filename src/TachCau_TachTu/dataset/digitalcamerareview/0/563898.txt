just got a cannon rebel t1i w / 32 gb sdhc card .
problems , help ! .
hello all .
i was lucky enough to get a canon rebel t1i for x-mas , and i picked up a 32 gb sdhc card from ... cough cough ... ebay well the card works perfectly for pictures in the camera .
i can take pictures , view them , etc. .
but when i try to take a video a metered bar appears on the screen , fills up , and will not allow me to record .
also the little red led light near the sdhc card door illuminates .
when i stick my 2 gb sd card in , it allows me to record videos fine .
does anybody have any ideas ?
i know the card is probably a cheap imitation and thats probably the reason , but i would like some advice from the experts .
thanks !
