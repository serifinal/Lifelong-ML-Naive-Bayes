powershot g9 usb mode / explorer .
hi all , i just bought a canon g9 , nice camera .
i have just one question , is it possible to set the camera to normal usb - mode ?
i mean so i can take the pictures off the camera without using an additional software interface .
i know i can take the memory card out of the camera and put it into a cardreader , but i 'd rather just plug the usb cable into the camera and then ' drag and drop ' the photos to my harddisk using explorer .
i can not find a way how to do this in the manual .
thanks for the help , heinzvoerbakje
