problem with canon sd 600 .
after almost 2 years of heavy use , a problem has come - up with my canon sd 600 .
here is the problem .
after shooting a photo , when the review photo appears for 2 seconds , i now get a large histogram with the iso setting , the awb setting as well as the # of pixels , on the right side of the lcd .
that display is so large that it makes viewing the review impossible .
i 've gone through all the camera setting for days , but to no avail .
the back buttons do n't remove it either .
what could this be ?
thanks .
