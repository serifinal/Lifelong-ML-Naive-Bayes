canon sx10 - best setting for indoor action pix .
i need some help .
i have a 17 month old son who refuses to sit still for a photo .
when inside , i am having a tough time getting a decent picture .
i ca n't seem to find the right setting for crisp , non-blurred , non-grainy images .
i tried the special scene setting on indoor and on iso 3200 .
the iso 3200 were not blurry but the pitures seem grainy .
i 'm using the flash most of the time due to being inside .
i bought this camera i february and am just now getting to experiment with it .
i am a photography lover but definitely a novice .
thanks for your help !
