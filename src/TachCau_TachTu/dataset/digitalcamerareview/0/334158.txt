canon sd 600 .
i have been using my canon sd 600 camera for over 2 years .
something strange happened yesterday .
i placed a partially-used 2 gb sd memory card into the camera .
i took several hundred photos but when attempting to playback , all the controls `` froze '' .
no menu , no scroll , no anything .
only the last photo taken was revealed .
when switching into camera mode , the menu was dead but photos could be taken .
what caused this ?
the partially-used sd card was also used in my panasonic lumix camera before .
i had to use it because the lumix has 10x zoom while the canon only has 3x .
i needed a better zoom .
could switching the cards have disabled the camera ?
after 2 hours , all functions returned but now i am nervous .
