help with a canon powershot a720 is .
okay , up until recently i 've kept my pictures on the computer and have printed out very few .
in fact , i have not printed out any pictures since i got my camera this past spring/summer .
the camera i have is a canon powershot a720 is .
the pictures look fine on a computer screen , but when my sister took them to wal-mart and target to print them out , they came out blurry and horrible .
i did look in the manual and it said to have the settings on superfine and l -lrb- 8m 3264x2448 -rrb- .
i took some more pictures in the auto mode and with these settings , but they still did not come out correctly when she took them in .
what else is there ?
is there another setting i should have it on ?
is the camera somehow broken ?
please help !
