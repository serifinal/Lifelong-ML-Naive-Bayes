powershot a95 owners .
any a95 owners who 'd like to share their thoughts ?
i really appreciate the form factor and having 4 batteries .
the batteries not only make the camera feel solid but also the battery life is longer .
you just have more to carry around when you need an extra set .
i 'm also really enjoying the flip - out screen .
