s3is recording problems .
i 'm a newbie and i have the s3is digital camera .
when recording a video the camera just suddenly stops recording after about 4 - 5 minutes for no reason .
it has done this with a 2,4 , and 8 gb sd memory card .
the batteries are fresh and the memory card is formatted .
the settings are re-set to the factory default settings .
does anyone have a solution to this problem .
the manual states that it should at least record up to one hour .
please help !
