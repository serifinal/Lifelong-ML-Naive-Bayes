sending movies .
i just got a sx30 yesterday and already had to call the helpline !
the hd chip will not work in my computer .... so i have to use the cable .
then , it would not play the short movie i had " taped " .
still pictures came out fine .
the tech at the company told me that i could not use high definition movieson my computer , so he had me take it down to 640x ( ? ) .
ok , now i can get a movie on my computer .... but when i try to send same to my sister i get an error message that says i have exceeded the restraints of an attachment .
for crying out loud , it was only a three minute video .
anybody able to help me on this ??????? thanks in advance .
