powershot sd1200 is image quality .
i just bought an sd1200 is ( my wife wanted an ultra compact ) , and i find the image quality to be horrendous .
printing out 4x6s with minimal cropping produces extreme pixelation .
i previously used the canon a620 ( 7.1 mp ) and loved the quality of the images , so i trusted moving to the sd1200 .
anyone have any ideas why the images are so poor ?
the reviews all throughout the web rate this a a great camera and one that produces top images .
i am not seeing it .
i do have the camera set to auto , and the file format to large ( full 10mp file ) .
please help !
