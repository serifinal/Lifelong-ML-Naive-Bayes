powershot a700 - did i make the right choice ? .
having purchased this camera a few weeks ago , i 'm disappointed with the 2.5 " lcd screen - it seems dull ( 115,000 pixels ) & i 'm having a difficult time framing pics .... i also have no idea what mode i 'm to be in when shooting sports .
finally , i 've run into a few people who have mentioned problems with their canon camera 's lenses - this camera has a 6x optical zoom .... did i make the wrong choice ?
the other camera i was considering at the same time was the panasonic lumix dmc - tz1s : i liked the fact it had a 10x zoom & an optical image stabilizer .
their 2.5 " screen i believe has 207,000 pixels which sounds like it would be much easier to see .
these two cameras were about the same price .
the reason the canon won out was i read several professional reviews of the panasonic indicating poor image quality & raves about the canon but user reviews rated the panasonic higher than the canon .
any feeback about any of this would be helpful - thanks !
