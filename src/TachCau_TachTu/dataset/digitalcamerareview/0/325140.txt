power chot sx 20 is ... .
what 's up with the flash ? .
hey all , hope someone can help as i just purchased this camera and i am a total noob .
the problem is that with the flash set to auto , it decides when to use the flash and when not to ... this is frustrating as it often opts to not use the flash when the dial is in auto mode .
from what the manual tells me , all i have to do to turn the flash on so it uses it for every pic is to press the lightning button and set it to the perm flash setting .
this of course is only when the camera is in `` p '' mode which means i have to program everything manually for just one shot .
does anyone know how i can get the flash to fire on every `` auto '' mode shot ?
thanks pablo
