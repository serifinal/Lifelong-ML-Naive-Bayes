sx10 goes to nyc .
the rule is : never take a new camera on an important vacation !
getting this camera in jan. and practicing around the neighborhood does not prepare you for the chaos of times square .
wow !
and if that was not enough , take a tripod and shoot you first canon night shots while on a nyc @ night tour !
here is the best of it .
there are no shots at the top of the rock for our tickets ( purchased ahead ) were during driving rains and zero visibility .
