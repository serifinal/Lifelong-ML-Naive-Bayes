lithium for canon sx 20is .
hi !
yesterday , i bought a canon powershot sx 20 is , and , of course , i am still learning all its possibilities .
in the manual they do n't mention about using lithium non-rechargeable batteries .
and i tried it anyway , and the camera does n't even want to work with these ( yes , they are new ! ) .
i do n't uderstand why this happens : 4 aa batteries rated at 6 volts total should work , no ?
( and last a long longer ) .
pls explain to me .
ah : another question i am pretty used to work using tv ( shutter - priority ) .
but on my new canon , when the light is too low , shutter speed changes by itself on this mode , going to a much slower speed .
is this normal on this model ?
i find it strange , because this feature should be only on full auto or p setting .
thx very much !
