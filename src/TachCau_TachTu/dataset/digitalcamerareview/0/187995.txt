losing focus in video with canon power shot sx20 is .
hi .
i 'm an amateur having an issue with a new canon power shot sx20 is .
when i shoot video , often it will lose the focus and then seem to search back and forth looking for focus .
i 'm shooting in auto mode , though i do n't know if this applies to the video or only to stills .
at an orchestra concert , for example , with the camera on a tripod , i 'll focus on a player , but then as the players move the focus is lost and it wanders .
it seems this may be related to the face detect setting in auto focus .
does that setting apply to video ?
i 'm experimenting with that set to flexizone / center .
is there a mode i should be shooting in , or something i can do to help it maintain focus ?
for example , what setting should i use when shooting video at a hockey game , when players may be moving toward or away from me ?
thanks for any suggestions .
