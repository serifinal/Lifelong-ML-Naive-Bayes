need help with new canon a610 .
hi guys , i decided to get a a610 after a while of thinking about it and im really happy that i purchased it .
i need help with the flash , at night for example , i was doing my router review , and i needed a flash , but the flash was very bright , how do i turn the level of flash down ?
also , some of my pictures are blurry when im not zoomed in and on the right settings ( i hope ) , why would you think they are blurry ?
