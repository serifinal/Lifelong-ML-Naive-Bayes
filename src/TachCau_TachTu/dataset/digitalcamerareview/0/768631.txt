canon ixus 980is set / function button jammed .
i 've got an ixus 980is , only 1/2 year old .
one day , i realize that the function / set button is jammed .
tried pressing hard but still stuck , also tried using a sharp thin object to try and lift the button up but still could n't .
sent to canon support .
repair cost is $ 64 usd .
just wan na hear from you guys whether it 's worth repairing the button .
the camera is still is still functioning well but the only reason why i need the button is to set certain options , features and to delete photos .
