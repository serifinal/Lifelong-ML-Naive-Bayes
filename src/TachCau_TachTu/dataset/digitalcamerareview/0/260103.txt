eos rebel loss of image quality problem .
i have a eos digital rebel that is about 2 years old .
i always set my camera image quality to large / fine which saves images at 300dpi .
for some reason my images are now saving at 180dpi - but the setting is still large / fine .
has anyone had a similiar problem ?
how can i get back to a high resolution image ?
