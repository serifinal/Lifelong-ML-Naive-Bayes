help using canon rebel xs .
i just got the canon rebel xs digital camera , and i started using it today after reading the manual .
i mostly got the camera to take photos of dogs , mine and others - that are always in motion .
i put the camera in auto mode , and it wo n't let me do continuous shooting .
i put it in sports mode and i can do continuous shooting , but the pictures come out all blurry .
the flash does n't go off in that mode .
it wo n't let me pop the flash up .
how can i take nice , clear pictures of dogs that are running indoors ( i 'll be taking lots of pictures at rescue parties , etc ) with this camera ?
what steps should i do ?
i 'm just a beginner with slr cameras , so this is all new to me .
