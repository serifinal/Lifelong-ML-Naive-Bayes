advice for my new sd790is .
i just got this camera to use in addition to my larger panasonic fz50 .
i have n't had a lot of time to play with the settings yet , because the battery was only partially charged -lrb- i was happy there was any charge at all coming from the store , so that 's not a complaint ! -rrb- .
so , as i wait for it to charge , i 'm trying to figure out the best way to take pictures with my new little camera .
it 's very fast compared to my other camera , which is essential for keeping up with my almost 2 year old daughter .
i 'm currently using the camera with the superfine compression in hopes of getting the best pictures possible .
i tried out the kids and pets scene mode as well as the indoor mode .
i 'm taking pictures in widescreen because my computer has a widescreen monitor and i like to have the same aspect ratio .
i find that some pictures look super and others just seem not quite right , so i was hoping for some advice to get the best pictures possible .
i 'm also trying to figure out if i can adjust how vivid the pictures are , but i 'm a little confused as to how to get to where i can change that setting , it appears to be grayed out .
any general advice is appreciated as well .
i have a 4 gb memory card as well .
i 'm very happy with the speed of the camera and i want to get the best pictures i can .
thanks !
