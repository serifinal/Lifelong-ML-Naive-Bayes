can not set shutter speed .
i recently got a canon sd 600 .
while it takes great close-up photos using the macro digital feature , my photos of fast-moving objects is less than great .
i attempted to photograph aircraft departing but each photo blurred .
i am unable to set shutter speed .
also , the shutter lag caused me to miss several shots , although i set it on continuous shooting .
any advice ?
