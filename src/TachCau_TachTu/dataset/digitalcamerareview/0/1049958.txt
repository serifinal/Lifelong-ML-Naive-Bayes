spots on pictures .
i just got my new canon powershot sd800 is camera and for the most part , i like it a lot .
i do have one problem , though .
some of my pictures have these weird clear spots on them .
i uploaded an example to show you .
even in daylight , sometimes i get these ( ranging from small to large ) spots on my pictures .
i do n't think it is the lens because not all of the pictures are like that .
so i was wondering if someone here could help me out ?
also , i was wondering if anyone could help me with a few settings on my camera .
i mainly just use it to put the pictures on my computer , once in a while , i 'll print out some standard sized photos ( 4x6 ) .
so i was wondering what the best size for my pictures would be ?
there is l , m1 , m2 , m3 , and s .
the larger the picture , does the quality get worse or better ?
and also do you think i should keep it on the superfine setting ?
the files are larger in size but i do n't mind if the quality is a lot better .
sorry for all the questions , thanks so much .
