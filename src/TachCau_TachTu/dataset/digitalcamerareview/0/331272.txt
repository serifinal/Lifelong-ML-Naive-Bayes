re : newbie w / questions about lenses ??? .
just bought a canon 50d kit that had sigma lenses that came with it .
i was originally purchasing one kit and the company that i was ordering from called and , of course , talked me into ordering other items that i would need .
what changed was the lenses ( which i did n't understand anyway ) .
the salesman asked what my intentions were with the camera and i told him that i wanted to get some good action shots of my kids who are very active in sports .
otherwise , just basic family stuff , nature , etc. .
he recommended the kit i got which had the sigma pro 70/300 f / 4 - 5.6 dg macro sld autofocus lens and a 28/70 f / 2.8 - 4 compact high speed aspherical lens ( both w / lens hoods ) .
my questions are .... are these as good as the canon counterparts ?
a friend of ours said that we got taken but i looked at the prices and it seems that they are kind of the same .
the salesman seemed to know what he was talking about and our friend is just getting into photography .... soooo ???? any opinions appreciated
