canon software bug creating folders .
i noticed this problem : if you set your canon camera ( several of the latest a models ) to auto create folders , then when you connect the camera to the pc using the usb cable , the folders wo n't appear , you will be able to see just the pictures in the last folder .
and worse than that if you have more than one picture with the same name in different folders , my god you Â« ll see several pictures with the same name , and if you open them you will see the same picture all the time , ( you will never see the pictures not in the last folder ) .
a real mess !!
the only way to see correctly all the pictures is connecting the sd card directly to the pc .
i tested several machines in the retailer today , and they do n't have any solution to provide , has any of you noticed this problem ?
i ca n't be the first ... thank you in advance for your replies .
