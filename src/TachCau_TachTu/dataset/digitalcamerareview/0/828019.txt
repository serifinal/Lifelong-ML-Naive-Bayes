fujifilm finepix a600 and finepix a800 digital cameras announced .
ahead of ces , fujifilm is announcing two new digital cameras for their entry - level a line .
the fujifilm finepix a800 and finepix a610 provide new affordable options for first time buyers or people looking for an easy to use upgrade camera .
there are a lot of similarities between the cameras and the biggest difference is the capture resolution .
the a610 is a 6 megapixel camera and the a800 is an 8 megapixel camera .
both cameras will be available in march with the a610 costing $ 129 and the a800 running at $ 179 .
( view large image ) one of the things that stood out for me in the press release was that both cameras feature a memory card slot that can accept xd - picture cards or sd memory cards .
i hope this is a sign that xd is on its way out.according to market research referenced in the fujifilm press release , more than half of digital camera purchases in 2006 were made by first - time buyers .
of those first time buyers , about 60 % of the purchases were for less than $ 200 .
the a610 and a800 are targeted right at these first time buyers , or people looking to upgrade their older 2 or 3 megapixel camera while retaining ease of use.here are some of the features that the two cameras have in common : new icon - based user interface that includes brief descriptions of the modes and settingsfujinon 3x optical zoom lenses10mb of internal memory so you can take a few pictures in a pinch when your memory card fills upxd / sd memory card slot2 .5 inch lcdplenty of scene modes : 2 shooting modes , 17 scene positions on the a800 and 2 shooting modes , 14 scene positions on the a610fujifilm finepix a800in addition to the features listed above , the a800 is the first 8 megapixel sensor in fujifilm 's a series of the digital cameras .
the 8 megapixel super ccd also features the low noise performance ( at higher iso settings ) than comparable cameras .
the a800 can shoot at up to iso 800 at full resolution.the a800 is also the first a model to feature a mode dial that allows the user to easily switch between capture mode , playback mode , and movie mode.additional a800 features : center af with macro focus range as close as 10cmwhite balance : preset ( fine , shade , fluorescent light ( daylight ) , fluorescent light ( warm white ) , fluorescent light ( cool white ) , incandescent light ) built in flash with wide angle range between 1.6 feet and 12.5 feetmovie capture of 320x240 resolution at 30 frames per second with monaural sound2 second and 10 second self - timerusb high speed interfacedimensions : 3.8 ( w ) ?

probably the most notable difference , besides the capture resolution , is that it has fewer scene positions ( which is really not that big of a deal ) .
