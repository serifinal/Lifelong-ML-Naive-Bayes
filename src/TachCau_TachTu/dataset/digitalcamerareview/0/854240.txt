why canons ' powershot sd 600 unlisted ? .
i am surprised that my camera model , canon sd 600 , is not listed on digital camera review .
is there a reason ?
other 2006 models are listed .
i also need to know how i can get a faster shutter speed when i try to capture fast-moving objects .
these shots blur .
there is no shutter control .
when trying to capture an image off a crt tv screen , the result is a half-darkened image .
any advice ?
