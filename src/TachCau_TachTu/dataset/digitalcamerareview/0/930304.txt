problems with canon s60 .
i bought a canon s60 in 2005 and it worked great until yesterday .
now the images have a pink hue , some ( but not all ) have a line across the middle , and the objects , such as furniture , appear to have a " fringed " edge .
any suggestion about what could be causing this and how to fix it ?
