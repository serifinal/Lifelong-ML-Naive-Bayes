turning d50 lcd on / off .
i got a d50 for christmas and i love the camera - except one thing : i cant figure out how to turn the lcd on or off .
shouldnt the lcd turn on when you depress the shutter half way ?
there has to be a way to have the lcd screen on while you 're shooting .
ive poured over the manual and cant seem to find the answer .
help !
