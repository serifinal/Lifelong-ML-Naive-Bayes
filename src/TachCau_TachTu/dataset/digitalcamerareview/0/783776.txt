extra battery compartment in sd700 is question .
hello , i 'm new to the world of canon .
previous camera 's have been sony 's .
i just bought the sd700 is and notice an extra compartment inside the camera .
it looks like it could store another battery .
but by looking at it , the only way i would be able to slide a battery in that compartment is if i take apart the camera , which i do n't want to do .
is this common with all canon sd camera 's ?
my question is can i utilize that extra battery compartment with a second battery ?
thanks in advance , patrick ( newbie )
