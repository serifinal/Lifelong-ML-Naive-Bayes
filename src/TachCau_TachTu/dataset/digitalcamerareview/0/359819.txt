ps a720is auto focus .
i 'm a point & shot guy with very little camera savvy .
that 's why i bought a p&s i ca n't seem to get those crisp clear pics that i used to get when i first bought the camera .
anything relatively close up comes out blurry and none of my pics have that - jump out off the page - quality that i 've seen with you folks .
i 'm very camera techno challenged .......... .
oh yeah ..... .
is there a way i can download a copy of my users manual ?
i only have the spanish one ..... .
thanks tommy
