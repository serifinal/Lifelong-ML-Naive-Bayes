keep getting change battery message .
hi , i have a canon powershot a560 .
i have had it for about two years now .
just recently when i go to take a picture , i keep getting a change batteries message at the bottom of the lcd screen .
i use duracell aa batteries , which are good because i checked them .
i also checked the little round battery also and that one is fine also .
i can not even get the lcd screen to show anything but a black screen and the change batteries message .
i did take the aa batteries out and cleaned the leads and then it worked a few times and then still the same old message .
it work on and off and now it wo n't work at all .
i can not afford a new one right now .
i hope someone can help me with this .
thanks , janine
