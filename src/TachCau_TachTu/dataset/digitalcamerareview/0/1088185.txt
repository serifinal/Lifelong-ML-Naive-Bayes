sports photography with eos 20d .
i want to shoot basketball photos .
i am using eos 20d .
just purchased 85mm lense but also have 100-300mm and 17-40mm lenses .
i was advised that the 85mm lense would be a good choice for basketball as well as other shots .
i am having problems with blur and i ca n't use flash at all in the gym .
what are the easiest settings to use to avoid blur on the photos with no flash .
sport setting does not seem to be fast enough .
what about av or tv set at 800 iso ??
any advice is appreciated .
