canon batteries stopped working .
i have a canon powershot s410 .
i got it about 3 years ago , and i have the battery that came with it and also an extra one that i bought at the same time .
they used to work fine , but lately i have noticed that they do n't seem to hold charge very well .
i made sure to charge them fully , but then they only last for a couple pictures before running out .
does this usually happen after a few years ?
i want to replace them but i want to be sure that it is the batteries that are the cause of the problem , as opposed to the camera itself , or the charger .
