is the s3 right for night sports ? .
i love my s3 .
it takes great shots with lots of light available .
however , i need to shoot my sons in high school sports - football and track -- at night , under stadium lights .
the shots are blurry , and i 've been told i need a rebel xti .
spending that kind of cash , and sitting in crowded bleachers is just not my idea of fun .
any advice would be welcome .
maybe i am not using the settings correctly ?
thanks !
