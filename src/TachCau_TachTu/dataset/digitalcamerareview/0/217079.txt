new canon eos 1000d vs 5d .
if it is really correct and if it is similar to 5d soft touch shutter , it is certainly not 1000d but something like 475d .
that feature is even out of xxd bodies standards .
it is very classy and much ahead of xxxd & xxd bodies current comfort level .
when i used a 5d , other than the low noise at iso1600 / 3200 , i had been amazed by the comfort of soft touch ( after pressing soft touch shutter , clicking shutter feels like an hard emergency button ; it is worlds apart ) .
1000d seems to be a modified 400d / 450d hybrid and certainly a newer camera .
it is not a rebatched 350d / 400d certainly .
