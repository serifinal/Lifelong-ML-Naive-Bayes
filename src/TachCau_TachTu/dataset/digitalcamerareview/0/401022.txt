canon powershot sx 130 is .
hi , i have just bought a canon sx 130 is digital camera and with that i have got 1 pair of nimh rechargeable batteries ( uniross aa / r6 1900 mah ) and also a charger ( uniross x-press mini ultracompact charger ) to charge the batteries , absolutely free .
nowthere are 2 pointss .
1 .
on the packing of charger the charge time of some batteries is mentioned which are 800mah nicd , 1300mah nimh , 2100mah nimh , 2300mah nimh , 250mah nicd and 1000mah nimh .
but nothing is mentioned for the batteries ( 1900mah nimh ) which i have received with this charger .
whether these are compatible with the charger or not ?
if they are not then why the company has provided those batteries with this charger .
2 .
second point is i used the battery in my camera and after some time camera showed me low battery and i had put them for charging and red light was showing on the charger when i plugged it in the socket and after 24 continues hours of charging light is still red .
ideally it should change to green if battery has got charged up .
( charging time for this battery is 7 hours as mentioned on batteries ) .
please provide a solution for my problem .
