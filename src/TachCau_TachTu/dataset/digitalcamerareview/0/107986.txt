camera too busy to shoot .
thanks in advance for any suggestions .
i am using a canon rebel xti .
i am using a sandisk 2.0 gb card .
intermittently , when i shoot , my camera stops and gets a `` busy '' sign .
this happens during regular shoots , not only when i 'm wanting to shoot fast .
example : yesterday i was taking pictures of a caterpillar -lrb- i 'm not kidding -rrb- ... i could n't keep up .
i 'd get three shots and the camera would stop .
twice the caterpillar manage to crawl very slowly out of the frame before i could begin to shoot again .
i switched cards to a lexar 2 gb but with no success .
any suggestions ?
i am missing so many great shots .
thanks again .
