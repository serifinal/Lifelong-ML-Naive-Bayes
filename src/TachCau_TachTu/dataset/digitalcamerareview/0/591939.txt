re : canon powershot a1000 is , a2000 is revamp popular `` a '' models .
just bought the new canon powershot a1000 is .
canon 's website under specs state that this will shoot widescreen images .
looked in the manual and all camera menus .
ca n't find it .
anybody ?
the a2000 is has 16:9 widescreen icon on the ad but not the a1000 ?
is this a misprint ?
i 'll return it if it is .
it 's one of the reasons i bought it , to skip photoshop cropping when importing photos in premiere video editing .
here 's the shooting spec : http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/co...eltechspecsact
