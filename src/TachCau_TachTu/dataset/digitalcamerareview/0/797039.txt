why was sd700 discontinued so quickly ? .
would anyone have insight in to why the sd700 was discontinued ?
was the added zoom not so popular ?
were there problems or idiosyncrasies unique to that model ?
i do n't see any other compact point and shoots with 140 mm ( 35 mm equivalent ) or greater zoom .
