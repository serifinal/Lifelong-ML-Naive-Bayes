is it possible to damage my camera like this ? .
hello i recently bought a canon sd1000 .
ive been browsing several camera sites to get an idea of how to use it etc. and then i wanted to do a cool night shot with " slow synchro " setting in the camera using a flashlight .
however in one of the pictures i pointed the flashlight ( a surefire flashlight ... the type the military / police use . .
mind u , these are very bright and " blind " u for a few seconds if u arent ready for it ) right at the camera i would say i was about at least 4 feet away ... so my question is , could i have messed something up ?
is it possible to damage my camera like this ??
( the ccd i believe ) the manual even says " do not point the camera directly at the sun or bright light sources ... doing so could damage the camera 's ccd or your eyesight " are there any signs that would tell me i have a damaged ccd ?
or anything i should look out for ?
i want to take good care of this camera since it is my first and im new to all of this by the way , the picture looked like a big orangeish ball in the middle and the scene along the corners of the shot were barely visible ... and the pics afterwards seemed " ok " i guess ... i just ask to be sure ... thanks for your help
