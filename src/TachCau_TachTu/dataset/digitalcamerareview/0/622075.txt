macro flower not showing .
just bought an s5 is because my s1 did n't have a macro mode .
seems no matter what i try i ca n't get the ' flower ' to show up in the lcd window .
i have tried touching the ' flower macro button ' on the side of the lens umpteen times .
camera is set in auto mode ... .
have read the manual which seems a little vague using macro so am wondering if i am missing something here .
not only ca n't i get the flower to show in the lcd monitor ... but i really bought this camera because i need it to focus within 2 " and was told this camera had a super-macro to do just that .
hoping someone can jump in here to point me in the right direction .
thanks , liane
