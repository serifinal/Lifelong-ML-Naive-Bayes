a red g1 is on its way .
once i made the decision that i really wanted a swivel lcd the rest was fairly easy .
( my wife would disagree ) i think a swivel lcd opens up whole new possibilities for interesting shots .
i went down to sammy 's camera here in la today and played with the g1 up close and personal .
i was impressed by the build quality , the 460k dot swivel lcd , 480,000 pixel high - res viewfinder , 23 - area af , etc. .
i was told by the sales guy that some pro customers use this cam as a backup because of the iq .
all the reviews i read were positive and the pix i looked at here were excellent .
i downloaded the owners manual and looked through it .
this cam offers a lot of possibilities .
i want to do some hdr and i found i could shoot up to 7 exposure bracketed shots to process into hdr .
this cam also shoots raw .
new lenses are coming out that will do everything i need .
7 - 14 ( 14 - 28 ) , 14 - 140 ( 28 - 280 ) and a 20 mm from panasonic is the current rumor .
there is already a 45 - 200 ( 90 - 400 ) available .
well , i was sold !
i pulled the trigger and it 's on the way .
http://www.amazon.com/panasonic-dmc-...7687537&sr=8-4 now i feel like a kid waiting for christmas morning ... too bad nikon does n't make a swivel instead of a flip out ( p90 ) lcd .
it 's amazing to me that more companies do n't make one .
i guess my d90 will have to wait awhile .
