canon cbk4 - 200 rechargeable batteries .
hi everyone , i am wondering if anyone has had this problem .
the first two times i charged the batteries , the battery life was great .
they lasted a long time .
however , since the third time , the batteries do n't even last 5 minutes before my camera flashes the low battery alert .
i store the two batteries not in use ( they came in a set of 4 ) in a drawer in my desk , so it satisfies the " dark , cool , and dry " storage place that the instructions recommend .
i also only recharge the batteries when my camera indicated low battery ( but the batteries were not totally dead ) .
is it possible that this is a temporary problem or have the batteries already lost their charge capacity permanently ?
thanks
