canon 450d - frame things on my 17 " laptop screen .
i just sold my d80 and eagerly awaiting to switch back to canon .
i was originally going to get the 40d but the xsi just welded its ugly head .
the main thing i want is live preview ( here are some great demonstration videos : http://www.infoborder.com/digital_ca...noneos450d.php ) .
i also do a lot of studio stuff where i can hook up the camera to comp or laptop and it would be amazing if i could frame things on my 17 " laptop screen or even my tablet .
i know the 40d has this feature , anyone know if the xsi will ?
the xsi has pretty damn close to everything i wanted to upgrade to from the d80 .
the main thing is the fps is still stuck at 3 fps , but thats about the same as the d80 , so i do n't really lose anything .
