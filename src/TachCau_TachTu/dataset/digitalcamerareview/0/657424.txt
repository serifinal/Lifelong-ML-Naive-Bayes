canon sx30is - landscape photo and washed out whites in sunny conditions .
hi everyone , new to the digital photo world .
we are at yellowstone park again and this time instead of my old 35mm pentax k1000 , i have this new canon sx30is .
thought it would be good first start without going to a dslr and lenses since this lense is somewhat a wide angle and it has decent zoom capabilities .
do any of you know what setting i need -lrb- i believe i will play with the white balance settings next -rrb- but we were in the canyon area and any pictures in bright sunlight of the waterfalls and river are just showing up with the water completely white .
any photo down river out of the sun shows the blue water color .
the same photos done years back with the pentax manual 35mm camera resulted in perfect color balances .
i have tried the auto , landscape and sport modes so far .
i think next would be some custom program settings with this white balance adjustments or is it just a limitation of these point and shoot digital processors and i really need the dslr to get true 35mm quality .
a side note , the zoom featutre in auto mode is fantastic , even hand holding at full 35x optical zoom results in a perfect clear picture when viewing as a slide show on the 22 '' computer monitor .
happy with the purchase so far , just need to see how to get some better contrast and realistic color in the white areas in bright sunlight conditions if possible . .
thanks for any advise or help !
kevin
