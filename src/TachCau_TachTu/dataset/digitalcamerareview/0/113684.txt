a620 ca n't zoom and auto focus ? .
i just bought an a620 and i find that when i try to use the zoom ( just regular optical ) i get the flashing red camera icon that the manual says is a camera shake warning .
it happens if i zoom in on anything .
i got this camera to replace a sony i had but am disappointed so far in that i ca n't seem to zoom without changing some kind of setting and i am not savvy at all in manual controls .
am i missing something ?
also , with my sony i could resize images , change color , etc. on the camera before downloading , a feature i used all the time ( and the reason i got rid of the camera since i could no longer access my pictures ) .
it does n't look like i can do any of that with my canon .
is that the case ?
