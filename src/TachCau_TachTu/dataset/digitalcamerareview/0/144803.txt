sony h20 or dsc - w290 ? .
hi all , i am in the market for a compact point and shoot that has good zoom , a rechargable battery , is easy to use , and takes great pictures .
i really like that h20 allows zooming while making movies , but i 'm wondering if it 's really worth it to spend more for this feature , since it does n't have wide angle .
the dsc w290 and w230 both seem nice , too , but do n't allow zoom .
would you recommend getting a cheaper point and shoot and a separate video camera ( my total budget is about $ 300 ) ?
also , would anyone recommend another brand or have any reasons why sony is n't my best bet .
these cameras all seem to have great reviews and the features : value ratio seem great .
thanks !
heather
