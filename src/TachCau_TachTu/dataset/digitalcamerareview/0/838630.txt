canon s5 .
hi everyone !
i own a canon s5 .
seems as though i consistently get grainy shots .
ca n't figure out what i am doing wrong !
also - just wondering how you can speed up the memory card and what accessories you have for your canon s5 ( or for those of you that know of the accessories , what would you choose to buy ? )
thanks so much !
