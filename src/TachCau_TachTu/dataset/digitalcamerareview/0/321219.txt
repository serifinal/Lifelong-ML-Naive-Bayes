new rebel t1i for christmas .
my wife surprised me with a rebel t1i with an 18 - 55 mm is lens for christmas and my son got me the speedlite 270ex flash to go with it .
after being used to taking pictures with my little sony dsc - h20 , i am suddenly confronted with dials , settings and menus galore .
it 's going to take me a month to learn how to use it properly , but i do believe the picture quality will far outweigh the time needed to do this .
now the question is , do i spring for the canon 55 - 200 mm lens , the canon 18 - 135 mm lens , or the tamron 18 - 270 mm lens ?
i would like something where i would n't have to be changing lenses all the time and it makes the tamron look like it would be a great all purpose lens .
the question is the quality of picture .
is it as good as the canon lenses ?
i like to take portrait type pictures and wonder if just a plain old 50 mm lens might work best for this .
any feedback will be greatly appreciated .
