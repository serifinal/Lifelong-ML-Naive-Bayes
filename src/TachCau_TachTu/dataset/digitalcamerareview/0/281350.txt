canon elph 300 hs scratches .
hey y' all !
i ended up buying the canon elph 300 hs last week and love it !
but the one thing i do n't love is the material on the outside .
it 's rough and feels like sandpaper .
well , i can get over that , but it 's already scratched up quite a bit ... with fingernail polish that 's scratched off from people exchanging hands , etc. .
is there any safe way to clean it or maybe something i can put on it to protect it from stuff like that and scratches .
thanks in adavnced !
