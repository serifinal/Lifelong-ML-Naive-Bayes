canon sx10 - is lcd monitor problem ! .
i just bought a like - new sx10 - is and something is n't right .
when i open the monitor a few degrees , it changes the display setting just as if i had pressed the disp button .
when the monitor is fully opened and facing back , the image appears upside down .
changing the ?
auto - rotate ?
from on to off makes no difference .
also , when the monitor is fully opened , the menu button does n't bring up the menu .
everything is normal with the monitor closed .
any ideas here ?
i 've used other cameras with a 270 - degree monitor and they just automatically flip the image so it 's right - side - up , and they certainly do n't change monitor setting when opened .
did i get a bad camera or am i not getting something here ?
