need help with a canon lens .
ok , so i purchased a canon slr eos ti 35 mm camera that came with a canon 35 to 80 mm f / 4 - 5.6 ii lens .
i have a sony dsc - h20 for family pictures , etc and am well satisfied with it , but i wanted something extra special to take portrait type pictures with .
once upon a time , i had a canon ae - 1 with a 50 mm lens that took just absolutely great pictures .
my problem with the ti is that the pictures just do n't seem very sharp and i think it might be because of the cheap kit lens that came with the camera .
it 's either that or what i used to consider to be sharp pictures have been surpassed by a little digital camera with 10mp .
the pictures i take with the sony are much more clear and sharp than what i can get with the canon .
i would like some input as to whether i am expecting too much from the canon or whether a different lens would really sharpen things up when taking protrait type pictures with one or two individuals .
any feedback would be greatly appreciated .
