zoom b ex .
hi again .... is there a way to load photos on cd from different dates .
at the moment on zoombrowser ex i can only load one set of photos ( from a download ) but cant figure out how to add a previous set downloaded on a different date .
i tried holding the ctrl button to pick up a previous shoot but it does n't work .
any thoughts ?
thanks in advance .
