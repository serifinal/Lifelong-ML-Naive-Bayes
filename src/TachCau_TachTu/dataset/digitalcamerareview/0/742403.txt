50d viewfinder ? .
i just picked up a eos 50d and noticed when i remove the lens and look thru the viewfinder with the front cap off it looks kinda grainy looking thru it ?
this is without taking pics just looking thru the viewer without a lens ?
is this normal ?
when i do take pics with the lens on and look thru the viewfinder its grainy till it take a picture .
but the pics do nt seem to be turning out grainy ?
any advice would help
