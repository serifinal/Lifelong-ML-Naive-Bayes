camera window on powershot model .
hi there i just bought a powershot 4500 and i use the camera window programm to download pictures onto my hard drive .
the problem is , when i connect by usb , it does nt give me the option to start up camera window .
i need to manually open the program ( through start -- > program ) in order to download .
is there a way to have the computer connect via usb to the camera and have the pop - up show the camera window program ?
thanks !
