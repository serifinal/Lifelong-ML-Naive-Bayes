broken canon powershot sd 1000 .
hey guys i was wondering if you could help me out .
i 'm okay at fixing things so nothing you give me should be too hard .
i have a canon powershot sd 1000 that will not take pictures .
whenever i go to take one i put it to picture mode and it shuts off .
it will take videos and i can look at pictures on it .
