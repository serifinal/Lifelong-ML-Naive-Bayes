canon power shot g12 at low light .
i had a canon g10 and now i have a g12 power shot .
with both cameras i have the same problem , using the internal flash , in low light conditions peoples faces are washed out , definitions are flat even at 8ft .
i ma using auto settings and 4:3 x10m size pictures .
am i asking for too much , or having the wrong settings ?
external speedlite 270ex or - so solved the problem .
