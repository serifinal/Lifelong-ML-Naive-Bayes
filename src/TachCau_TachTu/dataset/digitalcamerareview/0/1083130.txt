using filter with p / s digicam . .
hi everyone !
i am new here .
i purchased sx130is one week ago and it is a good point and shoot camera .
i have an old film slr camera with lot of filters .
skylight , uv , grey gradient and a very nice polarizer fader ( circular polarizer ) .
i do n't bother about other filters except polarizer fader .
is there any way that i can use this filter with sx130is ?
i know i sound like crazy but i sometimes shoot with holding the filter in hand and cloud effects are really nice .
is anyone know how i can use filter with sx130is ?
