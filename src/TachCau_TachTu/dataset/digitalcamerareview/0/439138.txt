canon sx30 and telephoto modes .
this camera produces great photos and takes my creativity to a new level .
the optical zoom is just awesome as well as the telephoto modes of 1.7 , 2.1 which i love as well , and they matched the zoom power with good image stabilization .
the shutter button is easy to press down which really helps at high power zoom levels .
i can now take some nice wide angle shots or magnify right up close .
canon added some new modes like super vivid which work great for colorful outdoor pics , i have been enjoying the miniature mode , fish eye effects , and they added another custom setting too !
the video is easy to use and zooms with all the same super power you get for still photos .
my fall leaf pics are just gorgeous , i spotted two squirrels on a tree branch napping face to face , and with hardly an effort i zoomed them right up close and snapped a clean shot .
i 'll put my sleepy squirrel pics up , one is approx 35x and the other telephoto plus optical zoom for about 55x total -lrb- see a face from 3000 feet : -rrb- .
i highly recommend this camera , especially if you want to enjoy you 're creative side more .
