low level format .
forgot to ask in my last post , what is a low level format and should i be selecting it ?
i bought an sd512 mb memory card so i could take better quality pictures and fit more and i 'm not sure which choice i am supposed to pick for formatting it .
the card is not from canon , it 's pny technologies - do n't know if this matters or not .
thanks !
this forum has been very helpful to me !
