s2is sports settings .
i purchased the canon s2is in 08/05 and think it takes great pictures .
i am having a problem finding a good setting for indoor sports pictures though ( the pictures are always blurry ) .
i do n't believe there 's a " sports " setting .
can anyone tell me what settings would take the best indoor sports photos ?
