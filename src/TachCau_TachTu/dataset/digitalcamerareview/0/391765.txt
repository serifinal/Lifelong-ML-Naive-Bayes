dont buy neoscene for 5dm2 video conversion .
i 've been searching for a good pc editing solution for the 5d mark ii mov files .
do n't buy neoscene from cineform if customer service is important to you .
i just purchased this product off cineform 's website for $ 129 , only to find out a few hours later that i could have bought it from one of their resellers for $ 99 .
i made a plea with david at cineform to give me a credit for the price difference .
his response was that dealing with processing a credit was too much effort for them to go through .
he told me that `` you can always find something cheaper on the internet '' -lrb- which has some validity to it , but he is the manufacturer - it should be cheapest from him !!! -rrb- .
they essentially told me , `` thanks for your money , sucker , now go away '' .
i 'm not a pro .
my budget is blown after purchasing the 5dm2 and premiere pro cs4 this year .
i really could n't afford $ 129 for the cineform encoder , but what i 've been reading about their product in many canon 5dm2 forums convinced me it was a must have .
cineform had no obligation to match prices or to make me aware that their resellers sell the product cheaper .
just like i have no obligation to hold a door open for a lady , give directions to someone who is lost , or help a friend move .
there are some things that are just the right thing to do .
the management at cineform seems to lack that sense .
do n't buy this product & hang on to your $ 129 -lrb- or $ 99 -rrb- .
its only a matter of time until cineform gets some competition .
