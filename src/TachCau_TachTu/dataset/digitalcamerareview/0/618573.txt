lcd screen not working when shooting !
help ? .
hello everybody : i got a question : i have just purchased a canon d50 -lrb- i have always worked with film before and had just a lumix panasonic in digital -rrb- and even when i always work exclusively with the viewfinder when shooting , i can not make the lcd screen work !
the lcd screen works perfect when reviewing pictures , info , changing settings and so for ... but if i want to use the lcd screen to see the subject during shooting instead of the viewfinder ... it does not matter what i do , it remains black .
could it be malfunctioning ?
or i am really dumb and i have n't find the way to activate it ?
it does n't work when pressing the little button on the left side on the back of the camera .
-lrb- the it is supposed to be used for that purpose -rrb- and i am quite sure it did work when i just got it .
anybody can tell me what i am doing wrong , or what is wrong with the camera ?
thanks so much in advance !
k.
