really enjoying my canon powershot sx130is .
just thought i would post here for anyone considering a canon powershot sx130is .
you can find them for less then $ 200 .
i bought mine at target before the holidays for $ 230 , but they 're on sale everywhere now , the thing to keep in mind , if you 've read some reviews , is that the batteries can get low rather quickly .
but , it takes rechargeable aa 's .
so , it 's not to difficult to have a ton of them with you .
the 12x optical zoom is awesome .
i was used to 4x . .
rather then give specs that you can find elsewhere , i 'll just share some work i 've been doing , which you will find only right here !
a few photos and then a video done in the super cool " miniature mode " .
enjoy .
