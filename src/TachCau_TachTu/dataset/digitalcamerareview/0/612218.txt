a610 spots on photos - dirty sensor ? .
hi .
i own an a610 that works fine , but lately i discovered spots appearing in my photos .
the spots appear in the same places in all the pictures -lrb- though they are only noticeable in clear backgrounds such as in blue skies -rrb- .
they are semi-transparent .
i 'm not familiar with the interiors of the camera but maybe they are dust in the sensor .
-lrb- i cleaned the lens , so it is not a dirty front element -rrb- .
is there any way to clean the sensor ?
is there any other possibility -lrb- dust in the lens back element or something ? -rrb-
any sugestion/info will be appreciated .
thanks
