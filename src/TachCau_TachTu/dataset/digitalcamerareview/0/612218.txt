a610 spots on photos - dirty sensor ? .
hi .
i own an a610 that works fine , but lately i discovered spots appearing in my photos .
the spots appear in the same places in all the pictures ( though they are only noticeable in clear backgrounds such as in blue skies ) .
they are semi-transparent .
i 'm not familiar with the interiors of the camera but maybe they are dust in the sensor .
( i cleaned the lens , so it is not a dirty front element ) .
is there any way to clean the sensor ?
is there any other possibility ( dust in the lens back element or something ? )
any sugestion / info will be appreciated .
thanks
