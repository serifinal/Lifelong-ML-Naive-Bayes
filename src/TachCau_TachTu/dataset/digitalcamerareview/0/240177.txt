olympus fe-200 digital camera first thoughts .
the olympus fe-200 is the current top model in olympus ' `` easy and fun '' fe line of digital cameras .
the fe-200 is a 6 megapixel camera with a wide angle -lrb- 28mm equivalent -rrb- , 5x optical zoom lens and a 2.5 inch lcd .
it 's quite a bit chunkier than the fe-190 that i reviewed recently , but it also has to accommodate a physically larger lens .
our full review is coming soon , but i wanted to give you a couple first impressions until it 's completed .
-lrb- view large image -rrb- &#160; olympus fe-200 on right , next to fe-190 -lrb- view large image -rrb- initial impressionsi really like having the 5x optical zoom on a point and shoot in this price range .
as a bonus , it can also do a wider angle than most of its competition - great for group shots.overall , the camera operates pretty sluggishly .
start up time is pretty slow , as well as menu navigation and paging between images .
shutter lag is not bad as long as you do a partial press of the shutter first.as far as build quality , the fe-200 feels very sturdy , especially for a camera in this price range .
i like having the zoom control as a ring around the shutter release - more prefereble than a tiny rocker button on the back of the camera.the 2.5 inch lcd is nice , but does n't have a ton of resolution -lrb- 130k pixels -rrb- .
it 's pretty visible outdoors , which is a good thing , since there is no optical viewfinder .
