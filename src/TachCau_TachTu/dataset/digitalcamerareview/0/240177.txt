olympus fe - 200 digital camera first thoughts .
the olympus fe - 200 is the current top model in olympus ' " easy and fun " fe line of digital cameras .
the fe - 200 is a 6 megapixel camera with a wide angle ( 28 mm equivalent ) , 5x optical zoom lens and a 2.5 inch lcd .
it 's quite a bit chunkier than the fe - 190 that i reviewed recently , but it also has to accommodate a physically larger lens .
our full review is coming soon , but i wanted to give you a couple first impressions until it 's completed .
( view large image ) &#160; olympus fe - 200 on right , next to fe - 190 ( view large image ) initial impressionsi really like having the 5x optical zoom on a point and shoot in this price range .
as a bonus , it can also do a wider angle than most of its competition - great for group shots.overall , the camera operates pretty sluggishly .
start up time is pretty slow , as well as menu navigation and paging between images .
shutter lag is not bad as long as you do a partial press of the shutter first.as far as build quality , the fe - 200 feels very sturdy , especially for a camera in this price range .
i like having the zoom control as a ring around the shutter release - more prefereble than a tiny rocker button on the back of the camera.the 2.5 inch lcd is nice , but does n't have a ton of resolution ( 130k pixels ) .
it 's pretty visible outdoors , which is a good thing , since there is no optical viewfinder .
