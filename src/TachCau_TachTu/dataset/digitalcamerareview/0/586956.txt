a570is loose cap .
hi all !
just got the a570 is , ordered it from amazon .
on the front around the lens there is a plastic donut type thing attached to the body ( theres a little button in front you can click to rotate it and take it off , exposing the sides of the lense ) .
this thing is kind of loose on mine .
i wanted to check to see if this is true of all a570is 's , or if this is just the case with mine ( in which case i should probably return it ) .
what i mean by loose is ... it 's loose , when you tap it it moves .
i 'm not sure what function the thing servs , or why it deserves a button to take it off , but its looseness is rather disturbing as it rattles whenever i pick the camera up .
thanks in advance darunium
