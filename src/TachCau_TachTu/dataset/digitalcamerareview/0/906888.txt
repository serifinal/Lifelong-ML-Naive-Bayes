mirror reflection .
my problem relates to my power shot sx130is .
when using outside in the sun i get a mirror reflection and ca n't see the subject .
i just have to guess what i have focused on .
the camera takes great pictures , but this is a real problem outdoors .
tried nushield dayvue film , but that did n't help .
any suggestions would be appreciated .
