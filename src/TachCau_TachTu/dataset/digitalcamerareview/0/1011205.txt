sx120 file numbering q .
i have the sx120 and i like to dump my images onto my computer after a photo session .
the problem is that the image count resets back to 001 on my camera every time .
my old fujifilm would always remember my image count even when interchanging between memory cards .
so is there a way to maintain my image count ?
