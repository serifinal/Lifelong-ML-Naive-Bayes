sx100 is problem .
i have had an sx100 is for about 6 months and i love it .
it has been the best digital camera i have had .
however , about 2 weeks ago i was at a parade taking pictures and knocked it against the ground since then any pictures taken outside are too dark .
i can lighten them up using photo enhancing software , but it really screws with the quality of the pictures .
i do have a service contract from where i bought it ( best buy ) where they will send it in for service , is it worth it ?
just after i knocked it on the ground it my husband played with some of the settings , but i have no idea what all he changed , might that be the problem ?
please let me know if anyone has any suggestions ?!?! thank you !
