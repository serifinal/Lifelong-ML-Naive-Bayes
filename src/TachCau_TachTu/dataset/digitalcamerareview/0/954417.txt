quiet introduction of the kodak easyshare z760 digital camera .
with the attention from yesterday 's announcement of the new cameras in the c - series , people are noticing that kodak has added a new camera to the " z " lineup .
the kodak easyshare z760 is a recent addition to the kodak web site .
the z760 has an msrp of $ 329.95 and will be available in may in select retailers and geographies .
the z760 is virtually identical to the dx7630 that is currently available ( from kodak ) for $ 299 .
the only difference that i could find was that the z760 is pictbridge compliant ( if i am missing something , let me know ) .
i 'm not exactly sure of the motivation for this similarity , but i 'll definitely keep an eye on it .
the z760 captures 6.1 megapixel images and has a schneider - kreuznach variogon 3x optical zoom lens .
the camera features kodak 's color science chip and has 16 scene modes and 5 color modes as well as compatibility with kodak 's printer docks .
the shooting modes include : auto , 16 scene modes , program auto , aperture priority , shutter priority , manual , and custom setting mode .
