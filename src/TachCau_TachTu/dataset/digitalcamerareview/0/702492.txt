random blurry picture ( out of focus ) .
( copied from another forum ) i 'm throwing this out in case someone has also experienced it or has some insight into what is going on .
i was taking a number of close up , but not macro , pictures .
specifically of printed matter such as newspapers , using a modest amount of zoom .
shooting distance was around three feet .
the camera was a canon sd700 is but i suspect the model is not relevant here .
to be specific i took one picture which was ok , then zoomed in a little and took a second picture , then took a third picture with the same settings and same vantage point as the second , all within a time span of about one to two minutes .
only the second picture was horribly blurry , looking like it was way out of focus , not a camera movement issue .
