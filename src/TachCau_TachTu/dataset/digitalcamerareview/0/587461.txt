canon xti rotation problem ? .
having a problem with rotation on my xti .
only photos taken with the camera rotated 90 degrees to the right are appearing as they should .
everything else is being rotated incorrectly , including images taken with the camera in its natural position .
is there a rotation override setting somewhere , or could my orientation sensor be bad ?
if so , can that be fixed , cleaned , etc. ?
here are the camera positions and resulting image rotations : - camera in its natural position ( landscape ) : image rotated 90 degrees to the right ( portrait ) - camera rotated 90 degress to the left ( portrait ) : image rotated upside - down ( portrait ) - camera rotated upside - down ( landscape ) : image rotated 90 degrees to the left ( portrait ) - camera rotated 90 degress to the right ( portrait ) : image appears exactly as it should ( portrait ) what gives ?
