canon xti rotation problem ? .
having a problem with rotation on my xti .
only photos taken with the camera rotated 90 degrees to the right are appearing as they should .
everything else is being rotated incorrectly , including images taken with the camera in its natural position .
is there a rotation override setting somewhere , or could my orientation sensor be bad ?
if so , can that be fixed , cleaned , etc. ?
here are the camera positions and resulting image rotations : - camera in its natural position -lrb- landscape -rrb- : image rotated 90 degrees to the right -lrb- portrait -rrb- - camera rotated 90 degress to the left -lrb- portrait -rrb- : image rotated upside-down -lrb- portrait -rrb- - camera rotated upside-down -lrb- landscape -rrb- : image rotated 90 degrees to the left -lrb- portrait -rrb- - camera rotated 90 degress to the right -lrb- portrait -rrb- : image appears exactly as it should -lrb- portrait -rrb- what gives ?
