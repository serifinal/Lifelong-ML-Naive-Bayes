powershot s400 .
i 've had my powershot s400 for about 4 years now , and i 've loved using it everytime .
i 'm surprised it even lasted so long since its really taken a good beating .
but it was getting old , and couldnt always read the memory cards , and sometimes the pictures would have errors .
so my bro got me the casio z60 , 6mp camera .
i hate to say it , but i think the picture quality of my s400 -lrb- 4mp -rrb- is still better than this new 6mp camera .
check my other thread below to find out why .
http://forum.digitalcamerareview.com/showthread.php?t=2134 at least now i feel comfort in knowing why i paid such a high price for the s400 when it first came out .
there is a difference ...
