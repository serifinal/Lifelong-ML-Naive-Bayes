used the canon t2i / 55od - again ! .
my director used the canon again for the next video that we shot .
this time we added a moving dolly and other stands to hold and maneuver the camera so that the angles would be more interesting .
the lens he used was a canon 16 - 35 mm f2 .8 l. i rented it from samy 's for about $ 35 .
i need feedback , please please note that there 's rapping in the song youtube - & #x202a ; damozel - " take a picture " the remix & #x202c ; & rlm ;
