canon powershot sx110is .
last weekend , after using the zoom on this camera , the zoom got stuck , i.e. the lens would n't retract .
when i tried pressing the on / off button the viewfinder just flashed briefly , so i could n't take any more shots .
about 24 hours later , when i pressed the button again , the lens did retract , but i still could n't get the camera to turn on .
about 4 days later , when i tried again , everything seems ok .
has anyone else had this problem ?
should i get the camera looked at by an expert ?
