olympus stylus 790 sw first thoughts .
the first olympus stylus was a tough , stylish , and very popular compact 35 mm point & shoot camera that produced dependably excellent snapshots .
digital stylus models retained the panache of the original &#8220; clamshell &#8221; stylus and added twenty - first century imaging and weatherproofing technology .
&#160; the third generation olympus stylus 790 sw shrinks the stylus mystique to shirt - pocket size .
&#160; the 790 sw is a super light , ultra-compact , and very thin digicam with seven megapixel resolution , a 3x &#8220; periscope &#8221; style zoom , a 2.5 inch / 6.4 cm lcd screen , and face recognition auto focus .
&#160; the 790 sw also features space - age water / dust seals - the camera is waterproof to 10 feet / 3 meters ( for up to 1 hour ) so it can be taken out in inclement weather , to the beach , to a pool , on a boat , or directly into the water - without damage .
&#160; the 790 sw is also nearly drop - proof &#8211; the camera can survive a fall of up to 5 ft / 1.5 meters - the tough as nails metal alloy outer body absorbs impact without passing the trauma on to the camera 's delicate optics and electronic circuitry .
&#160; finally , for arctic adventurers , the 790 sw is freeze - proof to 14f / - 10c .
( view large image ) &#160; the periscope style zoom produces images that are consistently a bit soft .
&#160; tiny internal focus periscope style zooms are substantially more complex than traditional design digicam zooms and as complexity increases lens aberrations and optical faults are magnified exponentially .
&#160; barrel distortion , corner softness , and chromatic aberration are all above average .
&#160; the 790 sw &#8217; s lack of either mechanical or optical image stabilization sometimes results in blurry images .
&#160; the 790 sw does feature a &#8220; digital &#8221; image stabilization mode &#8211; the camera boosts sensitivity ( iso ) and increases shutter speed to counter camera shake .
&#160; the problem with this approach is that as sensitivity increases , so does image noise .
&#160; the 790 sw &#8217; s most egregious shortcoming is its super shiny lcd screen &#8211; the screen is fairly large , color accurate , and relatively fluid , but so shiny that it is virtually impossible to use in bright outdoor lighting &#8211; and there &#8217; s no optical viewfinder .
&#160; default ( native ) color is accurate and saturation is near neutral , but like many p&s digicams the 790 sw can &#8217; t correctly render purple .
&#160; battery life is impressively good &#8211; the 790 sw &#8217; s remarkably tiny battery ( like the famous pink bunny ) just keeps on going .
&#160; &#160; ( view large image ) consumers who place a premium on ultra-compact size must be prepared to accept certain realities &#8211; mini-digicams obviously ca n't be expected to compete on an equal footing with full sized models .
like the first stylus , the 790 sw is eminently pocketable and capable of capturing exceptional snapshots and memory photos with little effort on the part of the photographer .
&#160; if that &#8217; s not enough , the diminutive 790sw is built like a tank and can be taken along on adventures ( like back country hiking , rock climbing , off - road biking , snorkeling , skiing , kayaking , canoeing , windsurfing , hang gliding , and white water rafting ) that would require leaving most other digicams at home.check back in a couple of weeks for our full review of the olympus stylus 790sw .
