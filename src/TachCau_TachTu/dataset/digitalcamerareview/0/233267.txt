zoom lens .
hey , i 'm a bit of a newby , and am taking pictures of horse related events .
i did a mounted shooting event , and some came out very clear , and some very grainy .
does that have to do with my settings on the camera , or light ( outside ) or not being able to get close enough to some of my subjects ?
wondering if i need a new zoom lens or just better photography skills .
i 'm hoping to go to the grand prix jumping show this weekend , but may get stuck in the nose bleed seats .
thanks sorry , i am currently using a sigma 55 - 200 mm with a eos30d
