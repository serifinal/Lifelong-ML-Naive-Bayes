ca n't see my raw files .
so after some research i decided to shoot in raw , and at first it was ok .
i was able to import and edit my pictures using picasa , lightroom , and picnik .
now though i ca n't seem to import my photo at all .
picasa give me error message .
lightroom say there is no picture , and when i open the camera in my computer there is no files , which before there was .
i 'm not sure what is happening .
i 'm using a canon rebel xs by the way .
much help would be appreciated .
also the last time i tried i was able to download the pictures using adobe bridge on my school computer .
is this a memory card problem or a computer one ?
i hope this is not a camera problem or i am screw .
