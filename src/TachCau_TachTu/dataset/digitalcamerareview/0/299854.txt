zoombrowser ex problem ... .
hi . .
i installed zoombrowser ex version 6 from the cd that came with the camera .
it installed perfectly , but when i run it , it gives me a " critical error " .
am i supposed to open zoombrowser with the camera attached even if i 've already transferred the pictures on my hdd or is this a version compatibility problem . . ??
thanks
