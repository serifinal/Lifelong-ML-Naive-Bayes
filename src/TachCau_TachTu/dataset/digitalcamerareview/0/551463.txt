re : canon powershot sx130 is review discussion .
i just got the sx130 a couple days ago after reading many positive reviews .
i have to say i 'm dissapointed in the picture quality when taking pics of my kids .
their skin tone looks weird and the shutter speed tends to go slow .
any suggestions .
i upgraded to this from a 2004 fuji that had 6mp .
i wanted something that could shoot great pics indoors and outdoors and go from picture to picture fast .
also the image stabilization is n't as impressive as i would have thought .
are their settings i might need to change ?
any advice ?
