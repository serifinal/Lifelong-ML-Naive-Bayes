sx30 mysterious shutdown quirk .
i recently purchased an sx30 as a second camera .
wow its one heck of a bang for the buck .
but it has a strange problem .... .
when i review photos for longer than 60 seconds , and then press the key to go back to shooting mode the camera shuts off .
if i review photos for 30 seconds this does n't happen .
is this a design feature , a design flaw , or a problem with my camera ?
thx
