dpi ?
for powershot sx20is .
i have tried to change settings and no matter what i do when i open an image in paint shop pro i can only get 180 dpi in the original image .
is there a way to get at least 300 dpi off the camera ?
i bought this camera because i am an artist and am trying to get high res photos of my paintings .
i have been fighting with this for a long time and would really appreciate some advice .
thanks !
