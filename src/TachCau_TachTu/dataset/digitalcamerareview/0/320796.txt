problem downloading images from flash card to pc .
i have a canon powershot a75 and i am using a new sandisk ultraii 2 gb compact flash card .
my problem is that i took a number of important images and video clips , birth of my second child , and now my computer does not see them .
i can review the images on my camera but when i put the card in the card readers on either of my work computers i get a message that no images are on the card .
what is worse is that ever time i try to download the images on the card onto my computer a few more pictures on the card are marked with a " memory card error " when i go back and try to view them on my camera .
so what should i do ?
is there a place i can take my card to that can download the images safely for me ?
thanks for any help you guys can give me .
john
