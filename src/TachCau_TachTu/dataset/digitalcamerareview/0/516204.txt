canon 300d software needed .
i need to get some images off a ' new - to - me ' cf card ( got it from a friend ) that is causing problems downloading with adobe bridge .
i would like to download and install any other software that can do the job , hopefully better .
i 've got a canon 300d that is still doing a great job .
i 've been using adobe bridge to retrieve images for about 4 years , but there 's a problem since i used the cf card i was given by a friend .
for some reason bridge stops downloading , usually 75 % of the way through a download job of around 150 raw images .
computer hd has lots of space , and camera battery is fine .
where can i get hold of some other software - i know i got canon 's software when i bought the camera , but ca n't find the cd anywhere .
many thanks .
