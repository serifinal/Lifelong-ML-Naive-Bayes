setting resolution on xsi ?? .
i recently bought a canon xsi .
i have the quality set at its highest setting ( l 4272 x 2848 ) when i work with my photos in cs , i see the resolution is only 72 pixels per inch .
my old canon powershot a95 pics were 180 pixels per inch .
our new kodak takes pics at 480 pixels per inch .
is there another quality setting i am overlooking ?
