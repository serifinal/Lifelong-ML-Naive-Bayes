mark ii 5d making grinding noise .
hi list !
i have a new mark ii 5d as a work camera .
and when ever use it for filming - it makes a grinding noise .
now - you ca n't hear the grinding noise when you are filming .
only hear it when you play back the video on the computer .
i called canon - they asked if i used an external mic .
i do n't too often .
it does not seem to help .
they did tell me to send it back for repairs .... i hate to part with it ... even for the 10 days they tell me it will be gone for .
any one else have this issue ?
beks
