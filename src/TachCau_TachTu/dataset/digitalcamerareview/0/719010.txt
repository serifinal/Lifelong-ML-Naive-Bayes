does the lcd screen of a canon powershot sx110 is camera have a protective layer of plastic ? .
i broke the screen of my powershot sx 110 is camera and sent it for repair to a specialized lab .
i received back the camera with a working screen but the surface is not as pristine as i expected ( several scratches ) .
can anyone tell me if the screen has a protective plastic layer that may have not been changed , or whether the lab installed a used screen ( while i paid for anew one ? )
many thanks
