issue with s5is - pls help .
hi all i 'm a very beginner to photography , but love taking lot of pics .
i own a s5is for over 3 years & i 'm very happy with it .
in last 3 days , i 'm seeing a weird behaviour with my camera .
i 'll upload the pics here .
can somebody help me diagnose as what could be the issue ?
i have n't dropped the camera , not changed any setting .
i used it on 11th as usual & since 14th evening i see all my pics are appearing like the attached .
i 've cross checked the image with lcd panel of camera & tv as well as on laptop & the lines do appear .
the image is not captured properly .
i 'm not sure how this can happen all of a sudden .
has anyone seen such a kind of issue with s5is before ?
has the camera gone for a toss & needs a replacement ?
thanks for any help .
regards ganesh .
