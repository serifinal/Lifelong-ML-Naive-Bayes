how do you take high quality pictures without flash ? .
i have a canon camcorder ( ivis hf r10 ) .
i have no problem taking videos with it but i am really disappointed at how the pictures come out using this camera .
especially when the room is dark .
the camera has no flash .
i of course change the mode so that it takes brighter pictures in the dark but the photo looks bad .
please help !
