canon sx 30 is constantly changes zoom range .
hi , i have a new canon sx 30 is and i love it -- especially the photo quality .
i am just learning the technicalities of it , but i 'm having a problem .
when i use the zoom to frame pictures ( especially using the zoom to take a close up from a distance ) , the camera often ( but not always ) moves out from the zoom level i have chosen and selects a much broader zoom length ( i.e. zooms out ) .
i do n't know whether this is something i am doing wrong , a setting i can change , or something wrong with the camera .
i would much prefer to be able to tell the camera how closely i want to take the picture , rather than having the camera " tell me . "
any thoughts from someone experienced with this camera ?
thanks .
