question about sd790 video mode .
i really like the lcd screen on the canon sd790 ic but one of the cons listed in camera reviews is the zoom feature does not work in movie video mode .
i saw one in person this morning but the saleman was n't much help .
it had no sd card in it but on video mode i was still able to zoom in and out .
the saleman took it and when he hit record ( would record w / o card ) , the zoom did n't work .
so i asked him could i zoom in and out and then video at that power setting or would it default back to the distance setting and record at that level only ?
he did n't know , can someone help me on this ?
thanks .
