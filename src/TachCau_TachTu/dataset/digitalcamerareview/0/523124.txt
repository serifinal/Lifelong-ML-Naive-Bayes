ben !
i need you again ! .
ben , so i got the canon s3 is like you had recomended .
i love this camera , it does everything i need it to .
has great capture ability while my son is running around or driving his powerwheels and what not .
my g / f snaps pictures of my r / c truck while it 's flying around the track doing about 45mph and it gets the shots with no blur .
but i am having a bit of a problem , i started using the camera with my old kodak rechargeables ( they 're old ) and i was getting roughly 30 pictures and they would die .
so i went and baught new ones .
they 're identical to my old ones and now i get roughly 40 pictures per charge .
is this normal ??
my old kodak camera used to fire off over 200 pictures on a charge on the old batteries before they died .
if not can you recomend some batteries that will cure this problem ?
link to a picture of the old and new batteries .
