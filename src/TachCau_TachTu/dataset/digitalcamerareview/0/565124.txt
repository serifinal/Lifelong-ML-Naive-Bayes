canon powershot a570is-need help .
i am new to your forum , so if i make a mistake please let me know , my help question is , i ca n't seem to get my a570is to print the date on the pictures , that option seems to be blacked out in the menu , i have had the camera for about 6 months and we really like it a lot , also takes some great movies too , any way if someone knows how to set this where it will print the date on the pics i would greatly appreciate it , thanks and also a great forum .
