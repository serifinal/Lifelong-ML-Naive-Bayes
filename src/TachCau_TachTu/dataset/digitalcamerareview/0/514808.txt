canon powershot sd850 is - problems with video .
whenever i 'm using the video function , it only allows me to record just over 2 minutes of footage and then i get a ' flashing hand ' warning sign and the camera aves what i 've recorded .
frustrating if i 'm at a gig recording a song .
is there something i need to change with the settings ?
