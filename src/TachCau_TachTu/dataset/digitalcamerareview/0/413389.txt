canon powershot sd1200is first impression .
i bought a canon powershot sd1200is based on a solid review posted on your site .
i &#8217; ve owned the camera for only 24 hours but have playing around with it a lot .
the first shots out of the box were of my hand as wanted to see how my shin tone would be reproduced .
the color and sharpness were very good .
i don &#8217; t recall how much of natural light there was but i know that i had an incandescent table lamp on when i took the first shots .
at any rate , i like what i saw because my shin tone was very well reproduced .
subsequent shots have not been as good .
shots of my hand have a sort of orange-ish/green-ish look and the shots are not as sharp .
there was zero natural light where i took the shots of my hand , but three ceiling incandescent bulbs provided light .
the camera was on auto set .
the flash fired .
is there a reason for a degrading of picture quality or is that the quality i should expect from a point and shoot camera ?
also the camera &#8217; s battery died after 80 shots .
i must add that i did play around with the menu too .
some of the shots include two sessions where i took 8 and 10 continuous shots .
is that the normal battery life ?
