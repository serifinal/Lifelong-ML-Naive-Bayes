canon sd1400 question ?? .
just bought a canon sd1400 .
when getting ready to take a photo , the camera is trying to focus and keeps making a ` ticking ' noise .
it seems like this is taking way too long .
i am pressing down half way as instructed on all these p & s cameras .
is this normal for the sd1400 ... anyone have one and know this ??
