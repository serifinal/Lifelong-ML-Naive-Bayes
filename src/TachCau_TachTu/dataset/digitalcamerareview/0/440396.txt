canon powershot s2 ca n't format card .
just bought a used canon powershot s2 off e-bay .
i 'm trying to format the memory card .
when i scroll through to select the " format " mode , it is blacked out and i ca n't select it .
i 've tried two different cards , one a universal and one a canon ( from previous camera ) and neither will work .
did i just get screwed or am i missing something ?
