canon powershot a590 .
hey there everyone !
im new to the forums .
i 'm looking for some help with my canon .
if i could get some help , that would be awesome .
i 'm beyond frustrated .
i document grows of medical marijuana .
i take pictures every few days and update growth , resin production , color , etc. ... i used to have a kodak 5.0 it was money !!
it took great pictures every time .
with this canon , i am having a much harder time .
pictures come out very dark , even with the flash on .
when i take a `` macro '' shot , it 's extremely blurry even when i 'm motionless .
the blur seems to be the main problem .
i can not correct it no matter what .
can someone please help me out .
i really want to like this camera , buti cant get good clear vibrant pics !
any help is greatly appreciated .
thanks !
