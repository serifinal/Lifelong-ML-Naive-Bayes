battery cover keeps opening .
after opening and closing the sliding battery cover on my canon sd - 600 , the cover has become loose .
the cover now slides open with just a feather - light touch of a finger .
often , the cover slides open while trying to snap a photo .
it would be ridiculous to have it repaired as it 's no longer covered by warranty .
any advice to keep it closed while camera is in use ?
i thought of placing a tape over the cover .
am i the only 1 with this problem ?
remember , when the battery cover opens , all power is shut - off , so i 've been losing loads of snapshots .
