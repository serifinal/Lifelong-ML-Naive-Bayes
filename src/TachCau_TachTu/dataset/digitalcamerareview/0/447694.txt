help with canon powershot s60 .
when i put the s60 camera is " auto " mode it displays the movie icon and when i press the shoot button it takes a video clip movie rather than a picture .
i 've tried re-setting everything to factory / default settings ( by holding down the menu button ) but it still wo n't take pictures ( only video ) in " auto " mode .
does anyone know how to fix this ?
thanks very much .
