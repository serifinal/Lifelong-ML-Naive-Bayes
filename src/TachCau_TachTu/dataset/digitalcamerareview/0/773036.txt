raw file size .
i am a bit confused about a camera upgrade that i just did .
i bought a canon 40d just before christmas , and have shot a few photo 's with the unit all in raw file format .
each of the files vary from 9 - 12mb in size .
then in one of the boxing day sales , i found a 50d camera for about the same price that i paid for my 40d , so i used the return policy from the camera store i bought from , and got the newer camera .
as you probably know , the 40d is a 10megapixle camera where the 50d is a 15megapixle .
that makes it have 50 % more pixles .
what does n't make sense is the raw files from the 50d are between 19 - 22mb in size .
that is about 100 % more than the 40d .
but as you are only getting 50 % more pixels , should n't the file size only increase by 50 % too ?
what am i missing here ?
it is like i am now getting half the number of photo 's on my 8gb card than i was before .
is this just me , or is that about right for this camera ?
matt .
