test drive a pentax digital slr .
pentax has announced a new promotion where you can test drive one of their k series digital slrs and get a chance to win a 2007 toyota fj cruiser .
from now until december 31 , 2006 , all you have to do is visit a participating retailer and test drive a pentax k100d or k110d .
pentax marketing director , ned bunnell , is convinced that once consumers get their hands on one of their new digital slrs that they will be impressed with the ergonomics and overall performance of the cameras .
the " test drive " consists of visiting a participating retailer and asking for a hands - on product demonstration .
if you ca n't find a retailer nearby , you can visit www.pentaxslr.com/testdrive and watch a product video and to get registered to win the fj cruiser .
the pentax k100d and k110d are 6.1 megapixel digital slrs .
the k100d features the pentax shake reduction system .
since the shake reduction is a ccd - shift mechanism , any existing pentax k - mount lenses can be used with the two cameras .
the test drive promotion will also apply to any additional k cameras announced while the promotion is going on .
