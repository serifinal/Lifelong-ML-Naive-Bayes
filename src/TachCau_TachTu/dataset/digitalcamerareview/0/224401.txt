newbie with canon rebel t2i questions .
hi all - first post here .
i just got a canon rebel t2i ( i 'm completely new to the camera world ) but am eager to figure this out and get going !
i like to think i 'm a quick learner !
i guess my first question is ... is there a free video tutorial anywhere to walk me through everything ?
i have searched online and have n't really found anything except reviews and maybe some tutorials , but they are n't very in depth .
my second question is - i had the ca mode all figured out and was having fun playing with the blurred background option .
but now when i go there , the background option is faded and it wo n't let me adjust it at all .
anyone know what is causing this ?
thank you for your help !
