lcd screen black - out ... .
when used underwater .
i took my canon sd1200 is on a snorkel trip ( in an underwater case ) and when the glare was bright , the lcd screen did not display the scene below .
since i was holding the camera pointing mostly down , the screen would have been receiving the sun 's light directly .
if i tilted the camera a bit , the scene would appear .
other times , nothing would work .
and at sunset , this was not a problem .
i want to know why this happens and if i can set any controls to avoid losing the picture i 'm about to take .
this is very frustrating when i have only seconds to ' shoot ' an eagle ray or octopus and do n't know where to aim the camera .
