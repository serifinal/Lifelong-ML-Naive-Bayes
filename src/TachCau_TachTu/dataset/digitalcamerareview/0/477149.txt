canon color accent .
can anyone give me ideas ?
i just bought a canon sd200 is from best buy in a bundle with camera , canon deluxe leather case , 4.0 gb sdhc card , and an extra nb-6l batery for $ 199.99 , and would hate to lose the bundle .
i love the color accent reture on my mom 's sd1100 is , but is has been removed from the sd1200 is .
is there any free software i can download that will do the same thing ?
i do n't want to take back the camera back because of this feture loss .
