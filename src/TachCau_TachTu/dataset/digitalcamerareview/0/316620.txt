dead pixels in canon a650 .
i noticed 2 dead pixels last night while using the cam - recorder of a650 .
one white and the other one blue .
they both show in video & pics .
i could easily photoshop them off , but im wondering if i should return the camera and demand for a refund , or is this normal ?
im quite happy with the camera , but now after seeing the dead pixels on screen & pics ...
