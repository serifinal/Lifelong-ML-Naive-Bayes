am i using my camera right ?
canon powershot 410 .
i have a canon powershot 410 digital zoom 11x and i do n't ; think i am using it to its full potential .
i take a lot of photos of my nieces and nephews and because they cant stay still for longer than a minute i find it hard to get good photos of them ?
i also take pictures at weddings and find that when in the church my pictures come out dark and blurry .
i also go to a lot of concerts and like to take shots but my close up shots are dark and blurry .
the camera is a 4 mega pixel and it will take out door photos very well but indoors i am struggling .
i normally have it set at auto ?
should i change that ?
should i turn of the digital zoom ?
i have it set at superfine - is that correct ?
i have the af - assist beam turned on - should it be turned off ?
what should the iso speed be at ?
i would be very gratefully if someone that understands digital cameras could help me please
