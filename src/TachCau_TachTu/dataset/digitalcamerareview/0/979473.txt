hey everybody !
the following video was shot on a canon t2i / 550d .
i wanted to rent a higher end " red " camera but my budget would n't allow it .
my director brian kim insisted that we use his canon t2i / 550d instead .
please let me know what you think !
thanks for watching !!!! youtube - damozel - take a picture
