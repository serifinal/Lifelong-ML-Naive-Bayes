ca n't get the natural colors .
i have a canon sd1000 .
the thing is that the picture i see from the lcd is different from the snapped photo .
it 's like the camera has somehow an intelligence to change the colors of what is real and natural .
how do i make my camera capture the naturalness of the scene ?
for example , tonight , i tried to take the evening scene , and i tried changed to night options , cloudy options , played with white balance etc , but it gave a brighter sky than what the lcd panel was showing .
