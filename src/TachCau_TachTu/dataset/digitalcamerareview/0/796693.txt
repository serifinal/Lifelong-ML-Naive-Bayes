a620 usage question .
hello .
i am a relative digital camera newbie and i just bought a canon a620 and i ca n't seem to find any option to set the aspect ratio to 3:2 for taking pics that will be printed as 4x6 's .
my old sony had the option ( albeit at a lower resolution ) , which would change the framing window to a 4x6 area .
is the only way to get 4x6 's from this camera to take regular shots , then crop to 4x6 ?
this make composing pics difficult .
any tips ?
pk
