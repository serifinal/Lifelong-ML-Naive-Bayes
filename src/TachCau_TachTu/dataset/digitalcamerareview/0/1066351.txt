canon powershot g7 - rattling sound .
hi , i bought canon powershot - g7 recently .
the qulaity is superb but i have a small doubt .
when the camera is on and ready to shoot . .
if i move / tilt it horizantally so that the lcd screen goes up and down i observe small crackling sound .
the sound is something like hard disk operational sound .
is it some kind of problem .... thanks a lot in advance
