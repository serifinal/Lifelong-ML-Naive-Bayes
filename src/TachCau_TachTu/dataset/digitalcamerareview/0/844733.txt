fuzzy movie with sd1400is .
just wondering if there is anything i can do about fuzzy video .
i bought the camera partly to get better video than my way old kodak easyshare -lrb- 2 mp and 15fps -rrb- but this is n't .
when i pause the playback movement is blurred , even with recording hd at 30fps .
anyone else notice this and is there some setting that will sharpen up the video ?
