leica gets ready for photokina with four new digital cameras .
leica will be showing off four new digital cameras -lrb- and a few lenses -rrb- at the photokina trade show that starts in just a couple days .
while three of the models are essentially the same as some panasonic models , the fourth one , the leica m8 , is the first digital camera to use the leica viewfinder system .
