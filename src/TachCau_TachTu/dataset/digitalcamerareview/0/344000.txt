a620 .
i am having a hard time finding the a620 from a reputable retailer and i was told that it has been discontinued .
newegg and buy.com both list it as on back order .
is there a good reason canon stopped making it , especially since the a700 is not a perfect replacement -lrb- i.e. no articulating lcd -rrb- ?
