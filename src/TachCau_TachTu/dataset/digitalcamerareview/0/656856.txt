can you help with camera repair , please :-rrb- .
i have a canon powersht s3is and i accidentally dropped it on my lawn .
everything seemed ok until i noticed this tiny piece of metal sticking out on the top .
it is protruding from the `` seam '' between where the front of the camera meets the top of the camera - right above the powershot logo .
it seems it may be causing my pictures to be slightly out of focus .
repairs are sooooo expensive , i checked the canon website and it gave me a repair estimate of $ 147 - i hate to pay half of what the camera cost me to repair this !
i have attached photo 's of the problem - please let me know if you think i can repair this myself .
