panasonic tx - p50g20 to samsung ps50c7000 worth it ? .
i 've recently been looking for a used plasma tv as i 'm on a pretty tight budget .
i had kind of decided on the samsung ps50c7000 , but then came across an excellent deal on a panasonic tx - p50g20 which i ended up buying .
i 'm very happy with the panasonic , but the reason that i was n't looking at that model in the first place was it 's lack of 3d and also i 'm not a big fan of it 's styling .
i am certainly impressed with the picture - i 've always owned plasmas , but the picture quality on this is amazing and i 've not experienced any of the problems which can sometimes be found on this model .
i do find it 's internet features a little disappointing though .
as it happens , i can sell the panasonic for a price that is enough to cover the cost of a deal on a samsung ps50c7000 that has been offered to me .
the main benefit being that the styling is much nicer on the samsung , and it also has 3d .
the styling is not a major issue really , and the 3d is certainly only in the ' nice to have ' category for me .
i 'm much more interested in sd and hd picture quality .
does any one have experience of these tv 's side by side ?
how does the picture quality of the samsung compare to the panasonic ?
