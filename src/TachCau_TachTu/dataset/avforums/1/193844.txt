panasonic txp42vt30 vs phillips 46pfl9705 .
hi all has anyone had any experiences with the two tv sets mentioned above ?
3d performance is not really a big issue .
i had the 50 " panny v20 before this , which i have now sold .
i would like to buy something smaller and have narrowed it down to these two - effectively the best plasma set and led set available at the moment .
your opinions would be very much appreciated .
thanks in advance !
