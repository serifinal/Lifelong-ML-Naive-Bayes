which 50 " for £ 799 ? .
currys have the following all for £ 799 ( which happens to be my budget ) .
50pz570t p50st30b p50g30b i see there are fans for all of these but should i plump for the p50g30b ( i say this as someone who does n't intend to watch much / any 3d ) .
that said , i guess i do n't envisage another big screen for another 5 years so perhaps i should get a 3d now ... .
they also have the p50ut30b at £ 699 - is this a more cannier buy ?
its good too and it has 3d capacity cheers , c
