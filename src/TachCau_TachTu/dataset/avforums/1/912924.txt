a few questions about the panasonic tx - p50vt20 and more . .
hi all , so i 'm about to make my purchase , after reading every single review of this tv , but then i stumbled upon a forum where people were discussing this tv and one particular person strongly adviced not to choose this tv .
the guy said this .
potentional vt20 buyers , please do n't .
i 've had this model and and this one has problems with serious retention / burn - in , which does n't seem to go away easily .
panasonic has traded this vt20 for the vt30 without any extra costs because there was no way to save the vt20 .
panasonic did n't say it in these words , but there 's a structual problem with the vt20 .
also weird that there 's no ' pixel orbiter ' and the ' scrolling bar ' on the vt20 .
this function is present on the vt30 and i must say next to clearly better picture quality , it does n't seem to have any troubles with retention or burn - in .
and of course the burn - in thread from tomasgajan on this forum as well ... has me worried ... alot .
is this a common problem , or more like that some people just got ' unlucky ' ?
cause i honestly did n't read this in any of the reviews .
other tv 's i am considering if i 'm not going for the vt20 samsung ps51d6900 samsung ps51d6900 tv review - final thoughts - trusted reviews samsung ps59d550 samsung ps59d550 owners thread but in what ways are these models inferior to the panasonic vt20 ?
help is greatly apreciated .
