ps51d550 or tx - p42g30b .
hi all , ok , i appreciate this is a 42 vs a 51 but ... my room is fairly small .
a 42 might be better in a way .
i was all set on the panny but i 've had last minute doubts and am tempted by the samsung .
not really arsed about 3d but the two models are more or less the same price on amazon at the moment so ... really i want a new screen for watching tv and movies ( blu - ray ) .
i 'll be getting a sony bdve370 which will give me the access to iplayer etc. .
any thoughts ?
really welcome any help ( and quickly please - i 'm itching to order ! )
thanks
