screen burn experiment .
hi , i am in the market for a new tv .
that means i will have an old tv lying around .
i might have a buyer for it , but if i don?t , i was thinking of setting up an experiment , trying to measure screen burn .
i was thinking if i set up the tv just showing a slide with giant white text on a black background .
i would leave it on this screen for , say , 8 hrs .
then turn it off .
see if the text is visible -lrb- which it will be thanks to ir -rrb- .
then put on a film or something and see if the text is visible .
check every 5 mins or so to see how long it takes to go away .
maybe i 'll set up a webcam when its all gone , i will set up the slide again , but this time do it for 16hrs .
rinse and repeat , adding 8hrs to the viewing time each time .
so question 1 - has anyone done this before ?
question 2 - anyone care to guess what my electricity bill would be ?!
question 3 - any thoughts on how to best control and measure this ?
should i use the same slide each time , or change it ?
etc i think this experiment would be better off with a modern mid-range tv instead of my old , used , samsung .
but hey - im not a millionaire !
