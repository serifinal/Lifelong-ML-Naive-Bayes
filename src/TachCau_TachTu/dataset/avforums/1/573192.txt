thinking of swapping my kuro lx5050 , what 's the best replacement ? .
basically since i had this set last year i 've had a few niggles with it .
i 've tried living with them but have now decided i want a set that does everything i want it to , unlike this one sadly .
john lewis will replace the set for an equivalent model ( about Â£ 2k ) and i do like panasonic , as i had a 42 " plasma before this one that was superb .
what 's the best put there now ?
