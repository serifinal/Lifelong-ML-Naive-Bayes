buying dillema .
next week i want to buy a new 42 inch tv .
i already decided that i will buy a tv with a plasma display , but i ca n't choose between 3 different models , mainly because i do n't really know the difference between hd - ready and fullhd .
i want to use the tv for three things : watching non-hd tv channels , connecting the xbox to my tv , and connecting my pc to the tv .
my main concern is , that two of the tvs which i want to buy are hd - ready , and at each site i checked , it says that their native resolution is 1024x768 .
but my pc runs at a resolution of 1280x1024 , and i would like to share my display with the tv , but to do this , i need my tv to run at the same resolution .
so my first question is , that if i connect the pc with my tv using a hdmi cable , can i set it to a resolution bigger than it 's native resolution , or the max resolution for the tv display is it 's native resolution ?
( this would be helpful as the hd - ready tv 's which i want , are 60 £ cheaper at my country then the fullhd tv , and price is an issue to me :p ) secondly , i would be grateful if someone could point me to some reviews about my tv 's , as i ca n't really find anything about them on the net except the specifications , and some lame reviews from which i do n't understand nothing at all ( perhaps the problem is with me :p ) ) .
comparissions would be even better .
these are the tv 's which i would consider buying ( with their prices , converted from ron to gbp ) : samsung 3d ps43d490 ~ 380 £ lg 3d 42pw450 ~ 385 £ panasonic neopdp 3d tx - p42st30e ~ 445 £ sorry , but i ca n't post url for the specs , i 'm a new member
