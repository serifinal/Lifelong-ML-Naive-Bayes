p50vt30 better than 50vt20 ? .
as i 've mentioned elsewhere , panasonic have offered to exhanhe my p50vt20 ( due to the floating black issue ) for a vt30 .
i would have to pay Â£ 100 difference .
floating black issue aside , is there any particular difference between the two sets ?
i 'm also concerned about this fluctuating blacks issue i 've heard about .
very undecided !
many thanks , james
