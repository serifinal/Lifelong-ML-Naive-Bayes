tx - p42gt20b or tx - p42st30b .
hi , i have a question about two tv 's , i was going to buy the panasonic tx - p42st30b , but i have seen the gt20b for £ 110 cheaper , so my main concern is .
is there enough of a difference between the two tv 's to warrant an extra £ 110 which i could use on 3d glasses .
also i could not find information on which glasses are compatible with the gt20b , i was going to buy the ty - ew3d3me glasses .
thanks .
