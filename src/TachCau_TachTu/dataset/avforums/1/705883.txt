samsung plasma as a pc monitor .
hello all and happy holidays !
i 'm looking for my next tv samsung galaxy s and previous 40 inch lcd have both been working flawlessly so i 'm feeling another samsung product .
got my mind set on 46 - 55 inch range and my budget is up to a Â£ 1000 possible contenders : - samsung ps51d6900 - samsung ps51d6900 51 - inch widescreen full hd 1080p 3d : amazon.co.uk : electronics - samsung ps51d550 - samsung ps51d550 51 - inch widescreen full hd 1080p 3d : amazon.co.uk : electronics the idea in this set - up is this tv will do everything , the connected devices will consist of : - ps3 ~ gaming , blue ray 3d - xbox 360 ~ gaming - sega dreamcast ~ soul calibur !
- pc ~ gaming , flims , general browsing all the devices will probably see about equal use mostly pc , but never for more than a few hours at a time , i 'm pretty good when it comes to making sure things are not left on and will take proper precautions like screen savers / tvs anti burn in tech , etc. .
is this a good idea ?
would it be best to go for the more expensive option due to the amount of use it will see , and the newer model might have more burn in prevention tech than the older model ?
would it be better just to go for a smaller led in this case ?
i 'm aware that burn in is plasma is more of a thing of the past but still very possible on modern sets , the question is , is it up to the task .
many thanks hjn123
