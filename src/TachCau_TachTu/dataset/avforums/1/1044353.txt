samsung ps51d6900 vs ps51d8000 .
hi all , well looking at plasmas which i intend on purchasing just after xmas , it appears overall value seems to go to samsung .
i know panasonic also steed well but looks wise theres nothing doing it for me and from what i read they re no more fault free than the samsungs so someone would really have to do a hard sell on my to pursue me panasonic is the way to go ( unless i can really see a difference anyway ) !
anyway , ive been looking at the ps51d8000 which cheapest price from a reliable place is £ 1250 , i like what i hear about it although im still confused as to why the ps64d8000 is actually better apparently : s anyway , i then looked at the d6900 which again cheapest reliable price is £ 850 .
so .... £ 400 is a pretty big difference .... .
i 've yet to be able to see either in the flesh yet ( i have seen the ps64 though and that just blew my mind which is why im hoping the ps51d8000 is just as good ) ... so is the £ 400 really worth it ?
i mean reeaally ?
i just want the best picture i can afford and originally i set my budget as 1k but assuming the ps51d8000 looks just as good as its 64inch version - that picture i could stretch my budget for .
oh and il be sat 10ft away , but with guest seating starting from 6ft away .
thoughts ?
