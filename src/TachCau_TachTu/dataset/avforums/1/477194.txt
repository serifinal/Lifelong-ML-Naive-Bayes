panny tx-p42gt30 good price ?? .
hi there , looking for a bit of confirmation really ... i have struck a deal with my local panasonic store for # 980 to include the tx-p42gt30 the dmp-bd110 bd player -lrb- worth between # 150 - # 180 after searches -rrb- and 4 3d blurays including avatar -lrb- which i understand is worth about # 60 - # 80 on it 's own -rrb- good deal ????? considering the tx-p42g30 is now only # 686.90 on amazon ?
