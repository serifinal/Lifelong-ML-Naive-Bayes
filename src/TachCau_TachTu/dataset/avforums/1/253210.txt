is the panasonic vt30 worth it over the gt30 50 " .
hi ive been trying to decide which one of the above to get .
can you please explain in simple terms whether its worth spending the extra to get the vt model ?
it seems that the vt is around Â£ 370 more than the gt model once ive bought two pairs of 3d glasses and wifi dongle .
( from amazon ) thanks in advance
