panasonic 42 " - g30 or gt30 ? .
finally decided to replace my old panasonic 37 " px70 and have narrowed it down to the g30 & gt30 .
i do n't really need 3d currently as it really does n't float my boat so the g30 would probably more than suffice , though i do prefer the styling and better build quality of the gt30 and i like the fact it has a filter to help bright light ( my tv is right next to a window ) .
my main concern is that i see there seem to be many problems regarding the green tinge effect though , but they do seem to be more common on the gt30 ( correct me if i 'm wrong on this ) .
i suppose my question is more along the lines of which one is less likely to have the green tinge fault , or is it really a lottery on either .
many thanks
