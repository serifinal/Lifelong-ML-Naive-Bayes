46 " vs 50 " gt30 vs ps51d6900 re .
dithering noise .
i 'm returning my 50 " gt30 to dixons for green splotches and decided to pay a little extra for a 5 year warranty so i 've reserved one at richer sounds , but before i actually go and buy it i need some help with this decision .
all my research lead me to the conclusion that next to the vt30 , the gt30 is this years best plasma and 50 " is the perfect size for my viewing distance ( 7 - 8 ' ) but nothing prepared me for the amount of dithering noise .
i 'm sure i can get used to it when i 've got everything set up properly to minimise it , but i find it 's heavily detrimental to the picture quality when i do notice it .
( in all fairness , it 's usually only in downloaded rips where it combines forces with compression artifacts . )
would i be much better off with a 46 " version ?
other than being smaller and losing motion resolution in 1080p 3d are there any other differences ?
i plan make to make heavy use of 3d for gaming , so the panasonics seem to be my only real choice .
since we ca n't get 1080p60 3d the loss of resolution is moot for gaming , but is it even that big a deal for films ?
does anyone know how the ps51d6900 compares with respect to dithering ?
it 's slightly bigger so i 'm assuming it 's worse .
reviews tend to gloss over the whole issue and are no help to me whatsoever .
the idea is for whatever i buy to last me several years and i really do n't want to spend more on an inferior lcd , so my only other option is to just get something cheap to tide me over and see what happens over the next year or two .
at the moment i 'm leaning heavily towards sticking with 50 " g30 .
