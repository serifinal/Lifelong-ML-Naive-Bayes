looking to buy a 46 '' / 47 '' 3d tv . .
help please ? .
hi guys !
basically im looking at upgrading my current set to a 47 '' .
im currently obsessed with 3d tvs after watching a footy game on my mates 37 '' .
i went to currys yesterday as i was told there is a bit of a sale going on , but the place was that crowded and it seems to be a lot of options going .
i spoke to one of the sales guys about an advice on what to go for and frankly cant say i got much of what he said , so decided to leave it , till i have spoken to someone in a a bit of a know how -lrb- you guys -rrb- my budget is # 700 , # 750 if i stretch and was wondering if anyone could recommend a descent set in that prize range .
one with the new smart internet technology will be lovely but not overly concerned too much about that as long as its 3d .
thanks
