plasma vs led .
i ' am looking into buying a new tv i have a 40in lcd samsung some people say the newer samsungs led picture looks like your there is this true with the panasonic st30 and seems leds or better picture ?
42in plasmas ?
i was looking at bestbuy and theres tons of lcds and led and only a few plasma tvs so i could n't get to view very many plasmas because they were all huge and i ' am looking for something smaller or the bigger plasmas that much of a difference between say 60in and 42in i cant go bigger then 42in tv so should i lean more towards led ?
only way to test plasma is to bring it home thanks
