panasonic txp42g30 mkv / mp4 playback video lag .
hi everyone , just got my brand new g30 2 weeks ago and starting to watch some full hd rips from external hard drive on usb input .
problem is , on some 1080p / i movies i get lags during playback ; sometimes only video , sometimes video and audio .
so i am wondering if the tv can actually manage to decode such heavy movies ( more than 8000kpbs for video bandwidth ) .
or will there be an update maybe doing with the firmware which will correct this ?
i am currently thinking of buying a multimedia hd for fixing this .
thanks for the help !
