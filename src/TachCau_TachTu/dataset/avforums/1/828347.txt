best ~ 55 " led tv on picture quality alone ? .
budget - £ 1800 ( though if theres no actual difference in the picture quality / screen between a tv costing 1100 and a tv costing 1800 , and the difference is just due to features i do nt need , i 'll obviously go for the cheaper option ! )
after the best 50 - 55 " tv , on picture quality alone : - purely for movies - do nt care about ' smart tv ' and all the other pointless stuff ( usb slots , wifi etc. . .
etc. . .
do nt need any of it ) - all i care about is the picture quality - not considering plasma due to the burn - in / image retention issues , especially as most films i watch are 2.35:1 ( unless the latest ones do nt suffer from this problem anymore ? )
- not fussed about 3d - do nt care about audio or design - think i 've put the emphasis clearly on picture quality alone !
- must be led - full array backlit with local dimming ( makes the search very hard .... ) any recommendations ?
because of my insistence on full array backlit - im hoping to stumble across 2010 range tv 's that are going cheap .
i 'd rather have a 2010 full array than a 2011 edge lit ...
