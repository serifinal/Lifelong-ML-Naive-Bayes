power consumption - just how much does plamsa & led use in on and standby mode ? .
hi guys i know this is a much discussed topic , and im not trying to start a plasma vs led debate .
however , i had a very good experience in currys yesterday talking to a sales chap .
he said that a plasma tv will use only a little more energy than a led tv - perhaps Â£ 20 / year * if * the plasma is switched off properly when not in use .
he said that plasmas use 40 % of their top energy consumption when on standby mode .
is this correct ?
he also suggested that buying a monster surge protector / blackout device monster power blackout powercenter hdp 850g surge protector buy online | currys turns everything off when not in use , hence the difference is minimal .
im looking at buying a 50 - 55 " tv - probably the panasonic gt / vt series - as well as an amp , bluray player and 5.1 - so power consumtion is a big deal !
anyone know the approx real world power consumption of the newer panasonic plasmas ?
and what the extra equates to each year vs say the 8000 series samsung leds ?
any advice would be great thanks guys
