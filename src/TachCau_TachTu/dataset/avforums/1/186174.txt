hmm panasonic txp50st30 or txp50g30b ? .
after a year indecisiveness and moving my sofa nearer my old crt to get the big screen experience i 'm finally going to buy a new tv .
after exhaustive review reading and umming and awwing i 've decided upon either of these 2 panasonics .
the txp50 - st30 from richer sounds for £ 700 .
i was going to buy it for £ 700 with 2 pairs of glasses flog those on ebay for £ 50 each and thus pay about £ 600 .
or the txp50 - g30b from currys for £ 550 .
i do n't really have any interest in 3d and was just wondering on anyones opinion on which set has the best picture for 2d ?
ill be using it for normal tv , dvds , virgin hd and i finally get to use the xbox 360 i bought a year ago .
