replacing a small plasma ( lg 32pg6000 ) .
i 'm thinking of replacing my lg 32pg6000 because my son scratched the screen with his toys !
i would love to stick with a plasma as i think it has the most natural picture .
trouble is , i ca n't really go much bigger than 32 " and there just are n't any plasmas that small .
ideally i would like freeviewhd built - in and 1080p ( for my ps3 ) but i ca n't find any plasmas smaller than 42 " with these features .
perhaps i have missed some ?
i think the room is too small for 42 " so my looming predicament is having to consider an lcd .
are current lcds still inferior in terms of natural - looking picture quality and viewing angles ?
if i did switch to lcd , will i regret it big - time ?
