anyone using panasonic g30 as a pc monitor ? .
hi all , ive been looking for a tv to use as a pc monitor to play high end games suc as fps .
the problem ive been having is that lcd 's have high input lag and/or lots of motion blur so i wouldnt be able to enjoy sports either .
this has lead me to a plasma but i have heard of problems with image retention , so has anyone got any experience of this ?
i came up with the g30 as im not bothered about 3d or tv internet features , and my budget is around # 600 and i was looking for at least 40 '' any info appreciated , cheers , luke
