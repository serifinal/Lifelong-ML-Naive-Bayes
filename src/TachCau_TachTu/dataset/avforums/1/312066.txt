best plasma for £ 1500 please people .
as it says really ... i have £ 1500 spend to spend on a plasma , i would use it for dvd 's , football and hd xbox360 .
i do nt know to much about the technology , i read all this stuff about pixel burning and contrast etc , and as much as ive read pages after pages of specs , i would like the views of people who own and use their plasma 's everyday to give me a real idea .
thanks in advance to those who help regards phil
