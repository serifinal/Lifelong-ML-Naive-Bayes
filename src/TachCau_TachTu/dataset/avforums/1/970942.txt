samsung ps51d6900 or ps59d6900 .
hi , i am trying to decide if the extra 8 '' are worth or not the # 450 price difference .
are there any differences between the two in terms of picture quality besides the size ?
i have seen the 59 '' model which was just stunning , is the 51 '' basically the same but in a smaller package ?
thanks in advance
