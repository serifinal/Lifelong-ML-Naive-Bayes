50 " lg or panasonic plasma in 2011 ? .
i 'm thinking of getting a plasma , i 've already done quite a lot of research but i 'm still curious about some things .
burn in seems to not be such a big problem as it used to be but is it really a pain to use games consoles or pc input with them , also what about channel logos , sports tickers etc ?
do you really have to always be ' on your toes ' ?
where are the lg and panasonic tv 's made for europe ?
also where are the actual panels made ?
why does there seem to be an overwhelming bias towards panasonic ?
most info i have found seems to suggest people think its better purely because its a japanese brand and its seems its mostly to do with brand loyalty .
its like everyone says your mad to buy anything else !
i ask because the lg 's i have looked at have better specs , better looking designs and are cheaper .
i have never even looked into anything panasonic till now and for the price i do n't see whats so special .
lg in my mind is a tier one brand and has been doings plasma 's in a big way for just as long so whats so bad about them ?
