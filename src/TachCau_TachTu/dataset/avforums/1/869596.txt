samsung ps50a457 .
hi all , just a question if anyone knows anything about samsungs ps50a457 .
i know it comes out this month and i have been told its 100htz .
thats all i know .
i had ordered the ps50q97 but the shop i bought it from said they could not order in any more as its discontinued .
i was then offered a ps50c96 .
i called samsung and they told me the c range is lower spec than the q. i then asked about the a range and sales staff did nt have any specs at all for the a457 , just it was coming out this month .
the shop say it is higher spec and costs more but if i do nt cancel they will do it at the same price as the q97 .
anyone got any info on the new machine ??
