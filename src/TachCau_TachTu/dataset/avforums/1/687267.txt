lg 50pz550 vs panasonic tx-p50g30y .
i 'm trying to figure out which tv to buy .
i think i 've settled on a plasma 50 '' -lrb- or there about -rrb- , and i will mostly use the tv for movies , tv and some gaming .
i have n't quite decided on going for 3d or 2d .
so one question first concerning that .
is it possible to download a 3d movie and play it -lrb- through network -rrb- in 3d on the tv ?
can the tv convert `` regular '' tv into 3d ?
or do i have to have specific 3d-blu-rays to enjoy 3d at all ?
in any case , i 've read that the p50g30 from panasonic are really good tvs , although they do not have 3d .
but i also see that the lg 50pz550 is offered at a low price so i consider going for that instead , as it includes 3d , but i really want the picture quality to be the first and foremost priority .
i can now get the panasonic for about # 1050 and the lg for about # 750 -lrb- i 'm norwegian , so the prices are probably a bit different here that what you 're used to -rrb- .
i would have gone for either of the 3d panasonic models , but they 're a tad outside my budget , unfortunately .
any advice on which to go for -lrb- or other suggestions/comments for that matter -rrb- ?
