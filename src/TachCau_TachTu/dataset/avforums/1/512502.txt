free extended panasonic warrenty or richer sounds ? .
as the subject but two questions really .
i 'm after the panasonic tx-p42gt30b after lots of reading up on here , mainly , and other reviews , and richer sounds have put one aside for me for saturday .
as far as i can see they 're the cheapest i can find , especially as they have 2 pairs of glasses thrown in .
they also do a 5-year warrenty for extra money , which i was planning to pay for , but then i noticed that panasonic are doing a free 5-year warranty on selected tvs -lrb- including the gt30 -rrb- .
so , my questions are : 1 -rrb- does anyone know any substantive differences between the two schemes / 2 -rrb- do you think it 's likely richer sounds would thrown in a 5-year warranty for free in view of panny 's offer ??
just asking ... .
thanks in advance .
