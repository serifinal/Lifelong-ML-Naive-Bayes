samsung ps51d550 or panasonic txp50st30 ? .
hi everyone , i am currently in a toss - up between the samsung ps51d550 and the panasonic viera txp50st30 .
i was almost sold on the panny , but the issues with green tinges has put me off somewhat , and the sammy has now got my attention , with great reviews , cheaper price and an extra inch in screen size .
however , one of the dealbreakers for me on this choice is the screen reflection that i have noticed people complain about in regards to this samsung model .
i have already posted on another part of these forums for advice on the samsung 's reflection issues , but i also need some general advice on what people think is the best deal out of the following : from john lewis : i can get the panasonic with 2 free pairs of 3d glasses and a free five year warranty , for £ 699 .
from pixmania : i can get the samsung for £ 616 including delivery , but only with one year standard warranty and no 3d glasses .
firstly , which do you think is the better deal ?
secondly , which do you think is the better tv ?
thirdly , weighing up the best deal vs the best tv , which do you think i should go for ?
thanks in advance !
