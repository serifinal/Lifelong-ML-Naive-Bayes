new home , new tv , no idea what to get ... .
hi and thanks for looking at this thread i need a new tv having recently moved and i 'm overwhelmed by choice .
i 'm on a budget but want to ' futureproof ' my decision so will stretch it if it 's a good investement .
here 's what 's important to me and my pre-teen children : + full hd / 1080 + up to 40 " ( frankly , anything will be an improvement on my knee - jerk purchase of a 26 " tv ) + access to freeview / freesat hd + pause and record live tv ( plus a good amount of storage to record all the films and tv programmes i 'll never find time to watch ) + rich sound + dvd player ( nice to have blu - ray for the future but not essential ) + ability to plug in games console i 've been to comet and currys today and given this brief to two sales guys and the more sensible of the two suggested this package combination : tv sony kdl40ex723 40 " 1080p smart 3d led tv £ 549 recorder samsung bd - d8500 / xu smart 3d blu - ray player with hard disk drive recorder £ 299 suround sound panasonic sc - xh150eb - k dvd home cinema system £ 129 total = £ 977 this is quite a bit more than i was hoping to pay but , as i said , i 'd rather spend the extra cash now then have to start upgrading and swapping out in the near future .
also , i ca n't help feeling there 's a less ' clunky ' solution at a better price .
any useful feedback would be most gratefully received .
thanks fran
