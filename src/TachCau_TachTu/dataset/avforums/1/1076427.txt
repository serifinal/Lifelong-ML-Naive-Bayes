which panasonic plasma ?
g20 or u30 ? .
is the u30 superior because it does nt have the 2010 problems like mll black level rises and floating blacks ?
g20 does have freesat hd but im not bothered with that .
g20 does have a better contrast ratio but with mll black level rises it reduces the contrast ratio anyway .
u30 only has 2 hdmi sockets .
is there any other differences ?
cant decide .
