freeview hd 5.1 audio on panasonic tx - p50g20 .
hello everyone , i 've had my tx - p50g20 for about 2 yrs now .
what a fantastic tv .
without needing to add to the already glowing reviews , i can say it 's one of the best buys i 've made , and i still continue to marvel at the fabulous picture .
now , in my region here in norfolk , they 've finally switched over to freeview hd , which means i can now receive bbc hd , itv hd , c4 hd channels using the built - in freeview hd receiver .
picture is indeed great , but the audio is strangely poor on the 4 hd channels .
upon checking my amp ( denon 2311 ) , it is not receiving 5.1 signal , only the l & r ( 2.0 ) .
i 've gone through all the settings in my amp and tv , and simply ca n't get 5.1 it to work .
i 've tried switching between arc and spdif digital outputs too , but again no difference .
the tv channel guide information does not register that the programs are broadcasting in 5.1 - since the manual says " multichannel " should be displayed - but it is n't .
now , upon searching this forum , i 've found a post which say the tv is not able to decode freeview hd multi-channel audio .
if that 's correct , that 's surely unbelievable !
if that 's correct i 'm going to need to get a new tv .
surely if a tv is sold as high definition , that includes audio and video ( ok , i 'm being rather hopeful here i know ! ) .
freeview hd - 5.1 dolby digital surround ?
is my tv flawed ?
have i really bought a panasonic hd tv with built - in freeview hd , which does not allow me to use the freeview hd channels because it ca n't decode multi-channel 5.1 surround ?
must i stick to watching the sd channels because the audio is better ?
help !
