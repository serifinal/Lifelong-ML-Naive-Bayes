samsung ps64d8000 for gaming .
hey world , i am seriously considering this telly ( unless anyone has any better ideas ) and have read great reviews for it .
only negative i can see is apparently it has lag for gaming , different reviews suggest different lag rates between 30 and 60ms .
does anyone who has this tv find it an issue ?
any comments ?
thanks , ian
