panasonic vt20 vs vt30 .
am thinking of buying a panansonic vt30 plasma but then started looking at the now cheaper superceded vt20 .
can anyone tell me the significant differences between the 2 models , if there is nothing too significant am thinking of saving a few pounds on the vt20 .
i would like the netflix capability .
also can anyone tell me if both these models use the ` one piece of glass ' look like the old v10 , a friend has this model and i like that look .
thanks
