buy panasonic viera tx - p50st30 now or wait for possible price drop ? .
hi all , just wanted to ask for the forums opinion on whether i should buy the panasonic viera tx - p50st30 with 5 yr warranty and a pair of 3d glasses for Â£ 699 or wait until new sets come out to get it cheaper ?
could it go cheaper if i wait ?
thanks for looking
