help ordering panasonic tx - p42u30 .
probably not the place to post this but i 'll give it a go im going to order a panny tx - p42u30b for amazon for £ 434.90 .
great price , but it says it wont be dispatched for two months !
is this true ?
or is it shipped out earlier than this ?
i can spend an extra £ 50 and i 'll have it by the end of the week if i buy from another shop that amazon is also advertising but ... £ 434 is already alot
