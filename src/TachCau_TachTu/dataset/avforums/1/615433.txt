which plasma should i buy ? .
hi guys first post here on avforums so i am hoping you guys can help me out .
i am currently looking to buy my first " proper " tv and have spent a lot of time researching and come to the conclusion that plasma is probably best for my needs ( sport , gaming , low input lag ) .
i was wowwed by the vt30 and gt30 but have been seriously put off by the green tinge faults .
i have been looking at the d8000 51 inch also but have heard there are brightness popping issues and peeling issues ... .
considering this is my first major spend on a tv , i was hoping you guys may be able to recommend something to me as i really have no clue what to go for !
i am looking for something between 46 - 55 inch and my budget is around 1500 , although i would prefer to pay less than that where possible .
any responses are appreciated .
thanks john
