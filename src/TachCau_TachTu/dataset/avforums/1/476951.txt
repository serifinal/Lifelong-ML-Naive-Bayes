panasonic p42st30 or g30 as first hd tv for parents who only have sd sky/dvds ? .
hello , i 'm buying a tv for my parents , they have a sony 28 inch widescreen crt tv that they 've had for must be 8 years but now the tube is starting to go .
they do n't have any blu rays and use analogue sky through a scart lead but could be swayed in the future , so i thought getting them a plasma tv would be good for all the sd content they have but could watch hd freeview in the meantime .
budget is # 500 - # 600 what looks to be best value for money is a panasonic tx-p42st30 at # 549 from john lewis as it has a 5 year warranty and that 's essential for parents :p also it seems to have anti-glare coating on the screen , my mum does n't want something that looks like a big black mirror in the living room .
i 'm also thinking the st rather than the s because of the better picture , the family will probably never have any interest in 3d .
panasonic also seems to have the best sound until i research a decent sound system .
however , the p42g30 is only # 100 more expensive at house of fraser and i 've heard the g series has a better picture and the styling of the actual tvs are better .
for some reason the p42gt30 is about # 1000 so that 's right out of budget range .
i could be barking up the wrong tree altogether and another model/series of tvs would be best , can knowledgable people please advise ?
thank you !
