should i buy a kuro lx-5090 now ? .
i bought a vt30 this summer , but too many faults and bugs made me return it shortly after .
i figured i should wait a year , for the 2012 models , but now i have heard that a retailer nearby has two new lx-5090 in stock , and i 'm considering if i should buy one or not .
the price is 1800 gbp .
what do you think ?
is it getting too old now , and what price would you pay for one ?
thanks .
