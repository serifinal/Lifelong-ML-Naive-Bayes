tv / amp question .
hello guys , sorry if i have posted in wrong forum , please move me if needed , i have decided to change my tv , i currently have a panny pz42 , and have made my mind up and going for a panny gt30 50inch , hopefully thats the right choice ( other contenders was samsung d8000 / 7000 ) , go on throw a spanner in my works .
the main question is do i need to change my amp to get the 3d pass through ( yamaha rvx1900 ) , the tv is park of a package with 3d bluray player , or can this be done through the bluray , i know i will probably have to at some stage , but can i get decent sound through the yamaha at present , or is this a pointless exercise , any ideas guys
