just about to buy lg 50pk590 .
done a bit of research and this tv seems to have all -lrb- and a few more inches than i was expecting -rrb- for my budget of # 600 .
due to it being larger than my samsung le46c750 it 'll probably become my main tv which will be used for movies and ps3 gaming .
are there any owners of this tv out there or people with experiences i should know about before handing over my cash to richer sounds ?
thanks
