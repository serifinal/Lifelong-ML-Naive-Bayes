42 " options tx - p42gt30 or vt20 .
richer sounds are selling the vt20 at £ 800 .
the gt30 can be found for £ 850 so nothing in it .
which is the best option for 2d tv and dvd .
i have a projector in a different room for br .
so mostly for terretrial and dvd 's when i want to watch an old films and not be reminded of low resolution on a 134 " screen .
this will be stand alone in terms of sound .
any thoughts on the extra £ 500 on the vt30
