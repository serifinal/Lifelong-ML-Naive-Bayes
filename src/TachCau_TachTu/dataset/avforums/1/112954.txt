lg 50pk590 vs lg 50pv350t .
hi folks , looking to get the new tv for our new house and i 've had my heart set on the lg 50pk590 for a good while now .
it 's at the lowest price i 've ever seen it at and i know it 's last year 's model so there are n't many remaining .
however , in currys yesterday i spotted the lg 50pv350t for about # 50 more .
it 's a 2011 model but ca n't see many differences at all .
old model appears to have more hdmis but that 's about it .
so which to go for ?
for the price of the new model , i can get the old model with a 5yr guarantee .
cheers del. .
