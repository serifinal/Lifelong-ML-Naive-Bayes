42gt30 or 42vt30 .
guys , in been a while , time for an upgrade !!!
tried a sony 40hx803 and returned it due to clouding and backlight issues , then samsung with other issues i don &#8217; t have time to scribe .
given up on lcd - so many clouding / backlight issues from all makes ( yes i 'm aware and it &#8217; s a lottery some good some awful ; panel lottery ) , the sony9x3 series seemed to solve bl / clouding problems but £ 1800 for 40 " no way !
( but sony 9x series the best lcd by far ) i 've been looking at the panasonic 42 " g30 series and i 'm very impressed , to my eyes it beats even the sony 9x3 series at a lower price .
we visited quite a few shops yesterday including john lewis ( who don &#8217; t sell the 42vt30 , and seem very obtuse on price matching these days ) , but one thing in common all shops recommending the 42vt30 over the 42gt30 ( for example panasonic local shop and s&v ) - the 50hz bug can be eliminated on the vt series and the blacks are deeper ( demo tracking a golf ball in the air , they showed how the vt30 can fix this issues ) the wife is sold on the panasonic plasma for 3d , i &#8217; m happy on 2d .
i 'm sure this has been covered but please bear with me , is the vt30 really worth the extra at 42 " size , price wise its £ 200 extra ( panasonic shop was very aggressive on pricing for the vt30 and until the end of july offering a 6 year warranty ) ; purely on picture quality ?
viewing : - liverpool football games ( wife ) - golf & sailing ( me ) - blueray ( both of us ) , we have a denon 3800bd so very high end .
