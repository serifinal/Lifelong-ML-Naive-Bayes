hi i currently have a 42 panasonic viera 42 " bought in june 2008 and i am looking at upgrading to a 60 " plasma .
at the moment i am swaying towards lg 60pz250t which is £ 1350 from amazon , .
samsung have a 59 " 3d model also which is £ 1250 i think .
i do nt know which has the edge lg or samsung for plasma .
my current panasonic 42 " does not have great standard def terestrial picture upscaling so i am looking for a tv with improved standard def picture quality .
plus of course the lg comes with a freeview hd tuner .
