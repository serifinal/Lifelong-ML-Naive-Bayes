best basic panasonic ( non 3d ) plasma ? .
hi all , i 'm looking to replace my ageing hitachi 42 " plasma for a newer set , always said the next tv will be panasonic so in your opinion which set should i be looking at .
i do n't need freeview or 3d or endless connectivity ..... just a basic plasma but obviously with as best as possible pic ' quality for as cheap as possible the hitachi has been and still is a great plasma but falls down especially with blu - ray in darker scenes , whether this is because of contrast levels or what i do n't know but i 'm hoping a newer screen will help .
there are endless panasonic models available from many places typically £ 399 - £ 500 + ........ any ideas on what to look for ?
is there much point looking at anything other than the tx - p42s30b @ £ 399 ???
