samsung ps43d450a2 .
i 'm considering getting one of these tvs .
i note that the resolution is only 1024x768 though ?
i watch mainly sports and normal programmes .
i sit around 3m away from the tv .
i 'm considering a 1080p 40 '' lcd tv as well that 's the same price .
i know little about tvs so any help would be appreciated !
thanks
