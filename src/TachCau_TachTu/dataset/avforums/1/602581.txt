samsung ps50q96hd - worth £ 250 ?
other recommendations ? .
i am in the market for a 46 " - 50 " tv for occasional gaming and movies .
i am on a shoestring budget of £ 200 - £ 300 so am limited on my selection , however , i am doing everything i can not to compromise on the picture quality .
1080p is important , as is the ability to reproduce shadow details well .
i have the option to buy a ps50q96hd for £ 250 , it does n't fit my criteria well , but i seem to have run out of options .
is this tv worth that amount of money ?
are there any other options which i have overlooked ?
many thanks .
