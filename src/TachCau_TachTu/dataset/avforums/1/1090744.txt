cheap ' ish anti-reflective plasmas ?
need info ( also a little about samsung ps43d450a2w .
does anyone have any recommendations ?
i was looking around at the samsung ps43d450a2w and its 3d counterpart for a while and it seemed to have something called " clear image panel " but from reviews / opinions it does n't seem to cut reflections and such down .
to make matters worse i went on the samsung us site for this same tv and it says it has filterbright technology but clearly the uk version does not .
at the moment i have just recieved an lg 42pt353k and i simply can not stand the reflections .
can anyone help me with a finding a decent priced plasma with decent antio - reflective please ?
( and yes , i know , get decent curtains and light shade . )
