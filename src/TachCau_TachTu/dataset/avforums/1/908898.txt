modern plasma 's region free ? .
are all modern plasma 's capable of displaying both ntsc and pal video on the actual screen ?
-lrb- apart from the in-built tuner for live tv which is obviously pal only -rrb- .
because i have lots american av equipment , dvd 's and games consoles and i 'm buying a uk tv , will they work ?
old pal tv 's used to go grey when fed with ntsc video .
thanks
