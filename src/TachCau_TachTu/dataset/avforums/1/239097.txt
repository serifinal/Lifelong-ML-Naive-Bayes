can you play xbox360/ps3 at 100hz on samsung plasmas ? .
hi , i am very close to buying a samsung ps51d6900 plasma ... .
i think that is upscales 50hz to 100hz ?
such as pal tv etc ?
so if i set an xbox or ps3 or pc output to 50hz will the tv automatically switch to 100hz thus eliminating flicker ?
please get back to me if you know asap thanks !
