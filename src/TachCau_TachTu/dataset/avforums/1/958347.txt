suggestions for large kitchen / diner .
we have built a large extension on to our kitchen and would like to put a tv and surround sound in .
reading through posts , it would seem that a panny g20 would be an affordable option but i 'm thinking that perhaps i should have that in the lounge , moving our ' old ' but still great pw7 ( 42 " ) into the kitchen .
if we do this then we 'd also recycle our canton speakers and pioneer amp .
all this equipment is around 6 yrs - does this seem a bit risky or a good idea ? '
risky ' becuase i do n't want to plaster in all this cabling and set up this equipment if its only got a year or two to live .
or should i get a g20 for the kitchen ?
either way , can anyone recommend a sound system i could use for the kitchen ?
looking to spend about Â£ 400 i guess .
i know i 'm rambling a bit but any ideas / reccs appreciated ?
thanks , calvados
