sorry another best 50 inch plasma thread .
hi , sorry i know it 's another " what is the best 50 inch plasma thread " but due to an accident with my aged nec plasma i am now on the look out for a new plasma .
unfortunately although i would like the panasonic th - 65vx300 , my wall would not be able to accommodate it , so i am looking for another 50 inch plasma .
viewing will be a mixture of blu - ray and dvd , web browsing and a little bit of gaming via my htpc , and using my crystalio 3800 for the vp .
not bothered about inbuilt tuner , inbuilt web browser , and only vaguely interested in 3d , but what i do want is the best picture on a 50 inch plasma .
not particularly bothered by the price but would probably not spend more than Â£ 3k on a 50 incher .
the panasonic th - 50pf30 would seem to be an obvious candidate but as always once you start searching the forums you start picking up the negative comments .
i know that i have just mentioned two panasonic 's but i am happy to consider other makes , also i would be happy to wait for the new year if any new models are coming out , any suggestions anyone ?
