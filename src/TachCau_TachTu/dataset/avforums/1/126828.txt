help with lg flat screen flatron plasma 42 " tv problem .
thinking about buying a lg flat screen flatron plasma 42 " tv that has an intermittant fault .
its very cheap and local , just wanted to see what you guys thought about the problem and what it might be .
here is what the seller has told me : " when you turn it on the picture is quite dark and picture flickers , but after a while it seems to rectify itself and works perfectly " " it can take from 10 minutes to a few hours to put itself right , sometimes it seems like its getting worse then it seems to almost correct itself and take no time at all to work correctly " any idea what would cause this ?
and any other questions i should ask ?
