panny tx - p50u30b or lg 50pv350t ?? .
hi guys , i 'm getting an urge to get a bigger , full hd screen to replace my faithful old 42 " 720p samsung ( forget the model number ! ) .
not wanting to spend a fortune and the two that have caught my eye are the panasonic tx - p50u30b and the lg 50pv350t .
my instinct says " get the viera " , but the lg is a ) a bit cheaper , b ) the specs report higher contrast , and c ) it looks really nice ( almost led - thin ) .
has anyone any experience of ( preferably both ! )
of these ?
cheers ,
