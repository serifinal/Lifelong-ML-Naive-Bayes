panny tx-p50u30b or lg 50pv350t ?? .
hi guys , i 'm getting an urge to get a bigger , full hd screen to replace my faithful old 42 '' 720p samsung -lrb- forget the model number ! -rrb- .
not wanting to spend a fortune and the two that have caught my eye are the panasonic tx-p50u30b and the lg 50pv350t .
my instinct says `` get the viera '' , but the lg is a -rrb- a bit cheaper , b -rrb- the specs report higher contrast , and c -rrb- it looks really nice -lrb- almost led-thin -rrb- .
has anyone any experience of -lrb- preferably both ! -rrb-
of these ?
cheers ,
