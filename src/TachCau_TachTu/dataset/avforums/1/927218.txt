panasonic plasmas .
i 'm in the market for a new tv and have more or less decided on a panasonic 42 '' plasma .
not being very flush with cash , i 'm looking at low end models and will probably go for a u30 or s30 .
but now i see an s31 model appearing .
does anyone know the difference between the s30 and s31 ?
