37 '' or 40 '' -lrb- led -rrb- , 100hz , # 500 .
i currently have toshiba wlt68 toshiba regza 37wlt68 review | tvs | cnet uk and have been very happy with it until now because it has 3 horizontal lines across the screen , getting darker all the time , so i need to replace .
my space is limited so i can only fit a 37 '' or 40 '' if it is led -lrb- width 95cm -rrb- .
i am also on a budget of around # 500 .
lastly my eyes are very sensitive to flickering , i.e. i notice it , which is why i bought the toshiba with 100hz any and all suggestions greatly appreciated thanks steve
