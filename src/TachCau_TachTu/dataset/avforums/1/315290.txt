wear in plasma .
hello to all readers .
as most of you are aware the new 2012 tv 's are due out very soon .
i 'm looking at buying the 50 " vt50 hopefully next month .
the question i have is do i need to wear in the plasmas picture in somehow such as leaving a certain picture setting for a period of time etc. .
or can i just start playing with the setting from day one as i please .
any advice would be greatly appreciated .
