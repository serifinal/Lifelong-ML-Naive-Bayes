panasonic tx-50u30b or tx-50c3b please .
i have a panasonic 42 '' plasma which is about 6 or 7 yrs old and have been very happy with it , it still has a good picture , but we want to go to 50 '' and be able to watch some hd stuff as we have a virgin v + box .
so we are looking at the panasonic tx-50u30b or the tx-50c3b , one hd ready and one full hd .
we generally watch normal tv and sport -lrb- football -rrb- and want to still be able to connect our old dvd recorder , which is a panasonic dmr-es20 the full hd tv is quite a lot more than the hd ready , what are your opinions on this ?
we have about # 650 to spend and will need to get cables and a stand , as the tv we have has the stand built onto it .
hope for some advice here , thanks
