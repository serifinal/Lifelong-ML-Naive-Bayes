which 50 " plasma for less than £ 1000 please ? .
typed in my thread title and the first suggested link was my own thread from 3 years ago , lol - which 50 " plasma for less than £ 1000 ?
thinking about upgrading my samsung ps50q97hdx to a newer model , my current tv still gives a great picture , but i fancy 1080p , a slimmer frame , and basically just something a little newer .
not too fussed about 3d , but if it 's got it , i can live with that .
same for internet connectivity , i 've got my htpc , so i do n't need it built into the tv .
i 'm after the best pq i can get for the price , and in no hurry to buy , so if i 'd be best off waiting for the next generation , i 'll ask the same question again when they 're released .
