panasonic 46 " plasma .
are panasonic expected to release any 2d 46 " plasmas in the uk this year ?
i have zero ( nay negative ) interest in 3d so certainly do n't want to pay extra for something i shall never use !
i can only see a 46gt30 upgrading from a 37 " , do n't think 42 " will be enough and 50 " will be too much - only around 7 - 8ft away ( tv - sd / sky hd , dvd , blu - ray , no gaming ) otherwise i may be forced to consider a samsung lcd - led reckon i 'll have a grand ( with 5 year warranty ) - plan to wait until next spring ( get in time for the olympics as do n't think i have got any tickets ) i did toy with the idea of a 46g20 from rs , but think they have pretty much all gone now cheers chaps
