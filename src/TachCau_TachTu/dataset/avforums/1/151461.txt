best tv under # 400Â 40/42 / 43 inches required .
hello , i am looking a new set for my mother and would appreciate your opinions and recommendations .
the tv will be used mostly to watch poor quality sd broadcasts on sky .
there is a large west facing bay window adjacent to the tv .
i had recommended the panasonic st30 for pq but the budget ca n't stretch to it if 5 year guarantee and new tv stand are accounted for .
in the evening the room is brightly lit by a flourescent tube so am not sure if plasma is the way to go since the screen may appear too dark for her ?
what do you think ... if you need any other information , please ask i will do my best to answer accurately .
many thanks ss
