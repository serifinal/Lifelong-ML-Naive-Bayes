best value 37 " tv for under £ 600 .
hi all , i 'm looking for some advice .
i 'm currently refurbing our back room and want to have a 37 " tv wall mounted approx 5 ft high ( bottom edge ) to be viewed from a normal sitting down on a sofa height .
its a lounge / diner arrangement which will be running a v + box as its main input , as well as apple tv .
37 " is as large as i want to go given the dimensions of the room .
outside of the obvious picture quality , my main feature requirements are : 1 ) must be able to play all the normal pc movie files via ethernet dnla / upnp ( mkv etc. . . )
- planning to run files from a synology nas .
2 ) reasonable in built speakers are a must - this one wont be rigged up to surround sound as we have another setup in our main room .
we already have a nice panny 42 " plasma & sony surround system for the films i 'm not fussed on 3d - if its a feature then great , but not expecting much at my budget level .
i 've been looking at the panasonic tx - l37e30b , but any advice greatly appreciated .
finally i do nt want to pay more than £ 600 tops - that needs to include a decent warranty also .
thanks in advance
