panasonic tx - p42g30 or tx - p42u30 ?? .
hi all , this is my first post on here so sorry in advance if this has been asked before i 've been looking to upgrade from my good old phillips 32 ' lcd and since i use the playstation alot i reckon that a plasma is the way to go .
so i 've narrowed it down to two , both are panasonic cause i heard they were the best for plasma the tx - p42u30 is my first choice and to my very little knowledge of tvs it seems great !
the tx - p42g30 is 200 quid more but apparantly has better moving picture resolution and contrast .
it also has alot more things that i do nt understand but they sound useful!lol so what i want to know is if it 's worth paying the extra Â£ 200 for a tv that will be used for gaming and the odd bluray ??
big thanks to anyone who can give some advice
