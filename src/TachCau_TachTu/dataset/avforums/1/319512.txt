help please - 50 / 51inch non-reflective screen .
i 'm trying to source a plasma set with a non-reflective screen for partial outdoor use ( partial , as in it wo n't be completely outside but likely to suffer in bright conditions ) .
most reviews do n't reference whether the screen is reflective or not so finding it difficult to find .
budget is around the Â£ 500 mark .
any recommendations ?
