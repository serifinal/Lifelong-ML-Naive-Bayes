lg 50pz250t or panasonic tx - p42st30b .
so , i 'm looking to splash some cash on my first hd telly .
i 've been swayed towards plasma 's due to their better gaming performance generally better picture quality .
i also might as well invest a little more and get a 3d ready set , even if i do n't buy any glasses just yet .
the two i 'm looking at are : the 50 " lg : lg 50pz250t 50 - inch widescreen full hd 1080p 3d 600hz : amazon.co.uk : electronics and the 42 " panasonic : buy panasonic viera tx - p42st30b plasma hd 1080p 3d tv , 42 inch with built - in freeview hd online at johnlewis.com the panasonic is smaller , but comes with a 5 year guarantee .
i sit about 10ft back from where the screen is going , so not sure if 50 " will be ' too ' big or if the 42 " is going to be big enough .
anyone got either of these sets ?
any comments about their relative merits ?
