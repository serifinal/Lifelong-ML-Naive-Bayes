what 's the latest version of the pz85b ? .
hi , i 've had a th42pz85b and a th46pz85b for a few years now and i 'm looking for another 42 " tv , i 'm really impressed with the picture quality of both sets mainly used for watching sky / hd ( football with ifs off ! )
and blu ray .
can someone help me out by telling me the latest models which are as good picture quality wise - perhaps they all are .
i have n't read the details but there seems to be some concern of the neo pdp screens ... are they really that bad ?
perhaps i should pick up a second hand pz80 / pz85 / pz800 ??
i certainly think the the styling on the older models is better than the bland new versions .
thoughts welcome .
