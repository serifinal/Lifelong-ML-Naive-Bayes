what panasonic plasma for £ 1500 budget ? .
hi , i am looking to buy a plasma tv from panasonic 's 2011 range .
my viewing distance is about 13ft or 4m .
i have a budget of max £ 1500 and i am mostly looking to watch hd content on it .
ca n't really decide between g30 , st30 , gt30 or vt30 ( vt quite expensive for my budget anyway ) .
i 'm not a big fan of 3d , i 'm more interesed in getting a great picture quality from bd player ( or media box ) and skyhd sources .
i 'm a bit concerned about the silver trim of the gt30 series , i saw it at different stores , in daylight it seems distracting .
please advise .
thank you .
