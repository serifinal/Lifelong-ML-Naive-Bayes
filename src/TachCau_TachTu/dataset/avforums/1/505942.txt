panasonic tx-p42v20 query .
hi folks i 'm posting in a section of the forum i rarely visit as i 'm mostly a projector nut and only have a couple of basic entry level tv 's but i 've decided to upgrade from my samsung 32 '' lcd tv to the panasonic tx-p42v20 .
the reason i chose this is because i wanted a plasma due to its quick refresh rate and improved black levels compared to the lcd 's - and also due to the very favourable review by avforums team .
i 'll be watching a lot of skyhd and blu-ray so i 'm sure this set will be perfect for that .
so i looked at a few models and seen this one on e-bay and got my offer of # 500 accepted -lrb- described as new other -rrb- .
i 'm thinking this is pretty good value due to being over # 1k new but then that was a couple of years ago and i 've there has never been one sold on here used or completed listings on ebay do n't show anything so i 'm not sure if i 've paid over the odds or not ?
when the tv arrives , i want to ensure its as described - ie , new other and it says that it was a customer return as an unwanted gift .
therefore , there should be zero or minimal hours on the tv .
i know some tv 's track hours usage , does this tv have this feature ?
i have 14 days to return the tv if i 'm unhappy so i 'll put it through its paces during that time .
i would also like to ask if there is anything specific i should be looking out for that might tell me its got a fault -lrb- seem like a silly question , faults should be obvious but i do n't want to miss something minor and then it develops into something worse ! -rrb-
any input at all would be much appreciated , thanks
