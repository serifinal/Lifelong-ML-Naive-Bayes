50 " plasma - panasonic or lg ?? .
hi guys , having had great exeprience with my 37 " panasonic plasma , i 'm very tempted to go panasonic again , with the 50 " 1080p model .
i can get this for around £ 550 , which seems an awesome deal .
however , i 'm also intrigued by the equivalent lg model , which is available around £ 465 , again , a ridiculous deal it seems .
question is , how do the two brands generally compare ?
for the sake of an extra £ 85 odd for the panasonic it seems daft not to .
what do you think ?
