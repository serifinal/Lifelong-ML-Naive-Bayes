can i go too big ? .
i 'm currently running a 42 " hitachi plasma which has served me well for the past 5 years .
however i 'm upgrading to set which 'll do 1080p but the size thing is stumping me , it 's a toss up between a screen size of 50 " or 60 " .
i can accommodate upto 60 " in both budget and space , but as my viewing distance is around 3m i 'm concerned it 'd be too big .
does anyone have any experience of this sort of scenario ?
if so i 'd love to hear it .
i 've got auditions booked for tomorrow and friday which 'll give me a better idea of things .
thanks in advance for any input .
ryan
