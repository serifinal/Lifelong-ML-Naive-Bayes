old panasonic or new plasma ?
contrast ratios ?!
help ! .
hi , i 'm unsure which tv to get , i understand panasonic have a very well known reputation for good quality tv 's .
up there in the top !
i 'm unsure between a panasonic th-42pz70b i can get hold of or wait it out and get a 50 '' newer tv , which will most likely be some cheaper model .
the panasonic has great reviews , and is 42 '' the other tv i would have in mind is some form of cheaper 50 '' tv .
i will mainly be watching sd movies and occasional tv .
my only concern is that the panasonic is ` old ' technoloy almost ?
its a good few years old the tv .
the contrast ratio of 10,000 to 1 .
even though its had great reviews , in comparison to 50 '' tv 's with 3 million to 1 , the 10,000 seems really ... low ?
maybe someone else can make sence !
i just want the best i can afford !
argh !
