what is a pioneer krp-600p ?? .
hi guys , i 'm right in the middle buying a used pioneer krp-600 .
as far as i know there are two models the `` a '' -lrb- with the media box -rrb- and the `` m '' -lrb- just the screen -rrb- .
but the seller has sent me a photo of the label and it reads `` p '' .
can anyone help with with what version that is ?
the serial number start with hkuk , might it be a uk version .
-lrb- i live in austria -rrb- .
he is offering the the tv with the media box , so it actually should be the `` a '' model .
i 'm going to drive to take a look at the tv next week , any tips on what to watch out for ?
thanks for the help
