which 50 " plasma for less than Â£ 1000 ? .
ideally looking for 3 hdmi sockets , but could live with 2 if needs be .
will be used mainly for watching sky hd ( i appreciate that 90 % of sky hd is actually sd !!! )
, xbox 360 and wii , with a little dvd watching too .
we 'll be approximately 10 to 12 feet away from the tv , so i suppose sd performance should be decent too .
i know nothing at all about plasma 's , and am looking to upgrade from a samsung le40r72 lcd , the only thing i know is that panasonic are supposed to make good ones !!!
