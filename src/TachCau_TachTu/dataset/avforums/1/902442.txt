panasonic tx - p42gt20 vs tx - p42s20 vs tx - p42u30 vs tx - p42s30 vs tx - p42g10 .
hello , i 'm thinking of buying a new tv , and i would need some advices .
i want a panasonic plasma ( i own one ) and i want 42 ' .
problem is - which model to chose ?
in my country , romania , i found it 5 models that look good - and i do nt know what to choose .
so , if you own one of these models or know a lot about tvs , your oppinion could really help me .
the models i found : - tx - p42g10 - tx - p42s20 - tx - p42gt20 - tx - p42u30 - tx - p42s30 i want the tv for gaming ( xbox 360 & ps3 ) and movies ( blue rays and dvs ) .
i own many dvds , so i want a tv that display the sd material at least decently .
now my problem is that every model comes with pros and cons .
i will tell you also the prices - for comparisson - the prices are in romanian coin ( ron ) - g10 : 2400 ron .
the oldest , but when it came out , i read a lot of great reviews ( including on cnet ) .
my concerns with it : 1 .
it is said that during time , the black gets deeper ?
or deteriorates ?
( i heard something like that on cnet ) .
2 .
i read on televisioninfo that g10 dose not handle the motion very well ( they say that a lot of artifacts appears ) .
is it true ?
- s20 : 2300 ron .
- gt20 : 3200 ron .
the most expensive , but it has 3d .
but i would like to know about the image quality ( 2d ) - is there a significant difference in comparisson with the other models in order to justify the 50 % price up ?
i mean , it looks the most well rounded tv when it comes to image quality , but does this translate into a significant image difference ?
( or is just on paper ) - u30 : 2200 ron .
the least expensive .
it 's a new model , but an entry one too - is n't it a little too cheap ?
- how is the image quality ?
on specifications says that in motion has only 900 lines ( unlike s20 -1080 lines ) - does this affect the quality ?
is it a cheaper processor ?
- s30 : 2650/2850 ron .
another new entry .
i have n't found reviews for it so i do n't know much .
i would like your oppinion regarding which model has the best image quality - but - take into the consideration the price too .
the gt20 might be better than u30 , but does this justiy the 50 % price up ?
( if the image quality is only a little better - you might not notice in practice , so it 's not worthy . )
thank you .
ps : sorry for my english , i am not an english speaker .
