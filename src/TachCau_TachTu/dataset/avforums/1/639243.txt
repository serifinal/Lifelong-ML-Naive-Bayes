which 42 inch plasma .
hi all .
i wanted to see what people might recommend on what plasma to go for .
i have an lg 32 plasma at the moment that is going to the bedroom , and am going to replace it with a 42 inch plasma .
i like the lg , but the thing that really annoys me is the brightness fluctuation .
i thought reviews of the panasonic viera txp42g30 looked really good until i stumbled on some posts relating to the same brightness fluctuation .
i really want to avoid this .
so can anyone give opinions on what is my best option for a budget of around # 600 ?
mainly used for watching sport & movies from my tv/dvr , movies from wdtv , sky sports from sky player thru a mini mac , movies on a blue ray player .
all over hdmi cable .
i am also investing in an av receiver , probably the yamaha rx-v371 , and some sort of surround sound arrangement .
any thoughts welcome , i was thinking the g30 was top of the list -lrb- and the budget -rrb- , but if i could get something comparable & cheaper -lrb- watching the telly from 12 feet away -rrb- that would free up budget for better speakers or av receiver etc i am all ears .
thanks .
