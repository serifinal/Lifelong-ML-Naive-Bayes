panasonic vt30 or vt50 .
hi all ; this is a pretty straight forward thread .
i just returned my samsung led tv and now have my money to buy a brand new tv .
it has to be a plasma and from what i 've read , the best plasma on the market is the panasonic vt30 .
should i buy this at its sale price now or wait and buy the vt50 at full price when it is released and do n't forget to let me know why .
also when is the vt50 due to be released in the uk .
oh and i will be buying the 55 " model .
thanks to all that read and reply !!!
