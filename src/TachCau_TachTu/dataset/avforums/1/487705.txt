ces 2011 products .
i 'm in the market for a 50 - 65 inch plasma and i 'm new to the forum .
i 've just read a review on the new samsung 51 inch plasma avforums.com - samsung d8000 ( ps51d8000 ) 51 inch 3d plasma tv review and the panasonic 50 inch avforums.com - panasonic vt30 ( tx - p50vt30 ) 3d plasma review reading around , there appear to have been issues with the panasonics ( burn in / blacks over time ) and the new samsungs do n't appear to have moved on much .
the panasonic epgs appear to be dire .
i have a couple of questions .
1 ) have sets demonstrated at ces 2011 at the beginning of the year filtered through to the retail channels yet ?
i.e. should i hang on a little while for new models to appear and be reviewed .
2 ) if the answer to 1 ) is yes , taking into account the various factors - is there a clear leader in terms of reliability ?
while i 'm not willing to buy a b&o or similar over priced set , budget is not really a constraint and according to a mathematical calcuation * , i 'd need a set between 55 and 60 inches in size ( 64 inches is the max that would fit on the wall ) .
if budget is not a constraint - is there a clear model leading the field ?
i 'm concerned about what i read about the panasoic epgs ( useability , no picture / sound while looking at the epg ) .
sources would be blu ray and freeview hd .
