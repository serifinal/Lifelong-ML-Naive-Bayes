panasonic 50vt20b or 50gt30b - which is better ? .
hi - i would appreciate some guidance from this forum .
i am replacing a broken v20ba ( no longer available from my retailer ) and have a choice of the vt20ba or gt30b ( similar price and i have a panasonic dongle already ) .
i am not particularly bothered about 3d so which would be the better 2d set to go for as both have the faster switching phosphors ?
is the new g14 panel much better than the g13 ?
i understand viera cast has been replaced by viera connect which has iplayer available , is cast still likely to be supported by panasonic for the next few years ?
finally - the vt20ba only supports 3d from a 3d source .
does the gt30b offer the ability to watch 2d in a 3d type environment using some fancy software conversion or is it too limited to just 3d from 3d sources - no reviews seem to discuss this ?
many thanks in advance .
