cable advice needed please - 42 " plasma .
just purchased a 42 " panasonic viera plasma screen but need to replace the power cord with something around 5m in length .
the current cable just looks like a lead for a kettle i think but about 2 inches from the end that connects to the tv there is a barrel like part that the cable passes through ... can someone point me in the right direction please and maybe somewhere to buy it from .
also need 2 hdmi cables of the same length and want to spend no more than Â£ 10 on each , any ideas ?
is the quality on these the same as with scart cables or ca n't i go wrong really ?
many thanks for any advice .
