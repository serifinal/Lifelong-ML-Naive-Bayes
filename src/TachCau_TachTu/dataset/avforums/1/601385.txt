thinking of buying a plasma .
h , i 'm thinking of buying a plasma tv , the one which i am looking at is the panasonic gt30 it will be replacing my sony lcd and it will be my first plasma , i will be using the tv mainly for sky hd and blu ray , i do not have a games console , with it being my first plasma i am a bit worried about image retention when watching sports ( i.e.football , cricket ) with the on screen graphics i also watch a lot of the news channels and skysports news which also have a lot of on screen graphics , so will i be ok to watch things like that for the first 200 hours .
thanks , andy .
