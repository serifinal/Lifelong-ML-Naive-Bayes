panasonic line up .
i understand the panasonic line up runs like so : vt30 - ultra high end gt30 st30 g30 u30 ?
- bottom end c3b - last years model in new chassis do the g3 / st / gt / vt use the same panel ?
also looking back through the generations , was this the same line up style for 20 and 10 ?
would a high end 20 beat a low end 30 ?
i am looking to buy a panny plasma from bestbuy sale and want to make sure i know what i am getting .
thanks !
