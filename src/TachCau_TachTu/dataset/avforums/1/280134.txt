why does my heart say one thing and my head say another !? .
hi guys i need to buy a 50 - 55 " tv pronto - before the decent discount stuff has all sold and i get forced to pay the full rrp of the new models in aprilish however - im in a total dilemma !
my heart says get a 50 " gt30 with 5 yr warranty .
take the risk of the green blobs - if you notice it ( which you prob wont ! )
- you can always return & refund and put the money towards a gt50 .
my head says that plasma is n't for you .
you watch tv during the day sometimes .
the room is bright although there wont be any direct glare on the screen .
it will cost more to run and if the tv will last you perhaps 8 - 10 years - it may be an extra £ 600 to run the plasma .
get a 55 " led samsung 6530 .
the plasma offerings from samsung do nt appeal .
im not sure why .
either plasma is right - in which case the pannys are the best ( provided you get a 5 yr warranty ) - or led is for me !
im finding this decision vvv tricky .
i will be spending another £ 1k on sound / amp / bluray player so want the tv to make the most of it ( and visa versa ) interested in anyones opinions .
this is exhausting !
lol .
