panasonic tx - l32dt30b or samsung ue32d6530 .
hi guys down to these two for my back room .
we do use this room a fair bit , watching mainly freeview , dvd 's and my wd medid player .
room size suits a 32 " set so larger is no good .
read reviews for both sets and the only prob with the panasonic seemed to be the price but now it 's down to £ 499.00 at comets does that mean it now gets the nod .
samsung seemed to get much praise , built in wifi being clapped very loudly , but again only seemed to get top marks because of the panasonics original £ 700.00 price tag .
the samsung also was slated for it 's poor 3d quality .
even though 3d is not my main concern at the mo. any advice much appreciated cheers matthew
