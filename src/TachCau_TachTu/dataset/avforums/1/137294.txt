what replaced the lg50pk350 ? .
i used to own a pk350 , great tv but i recently had to sell it unfortunately .
i thought it was tremendous value for money , i 'm now looking for a new 50in plasma -lrb- on a very tight budget sadly -rrb- so i figured i 'll look at lg first .
so i 'm wondering what is it 's replacement ?
or what current lg plasma would be closest to it in terms of spec ?
thanks . .
