new panny vt30 v second hand kuro ? .
guys sorry if this is an old chesnut , i 'm not a regular vistor .
my problem is this - i have owned a pio pdp436xde since 2005 , and been very happy with it .
while standard def ( sky ) is a bit pants to be honest , i have seen nothing yet to touch it on hd , and yes it is only 720p !
having said that , i have n't made a point of actively looking for a screen recently , the only true comparison is my brother in laws 1080p panny ( do nt know the model ) , which to be honest ai nt as good on hd as my pio .
i am looking to go up to a 50 " inch screen though , so can anyone give me an objective opinion on whether ( from an hd pic angle ) a used kuro or a new vt 30 would be a better buy ?
it 's very difficult to find a shop that can give a decent demo of the panny , most of em have some silly 3d demo going on , and 3d ai n't important to me .
