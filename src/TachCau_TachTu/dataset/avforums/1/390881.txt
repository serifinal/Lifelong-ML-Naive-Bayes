panasonic txp50st30 vs g20 ?? .
hiya folks , i currently have a panasonic txp50g20 and my parents are now on the look out for a big format tv and are have always had eyes on my g20 ... and i am tempted to let them have it at a very nice price and move onto the panasonic txp50st30 with a 5 yr warranty and some 3d loving ... simple question is this : is the 50st30 comparable or even better than the g20 when it comes to 2d picture quality - not really bothered about feature lists lost or gained as i tend to solely use my tv for the purpose it was intended ... anybody done a similar up / downgrade this year ??
over to you ...
