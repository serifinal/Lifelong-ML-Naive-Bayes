plasma refresh rates on pc .
i have searched but can not find anything on this ... .
i am considering buying a plasma but i hate flickering ... .
if i run a plasma through my pc input ( samsung d550 or d6900 ) which is capable of 96hz / 100hz playback , can i run it at these settings on my pc by selecting 24 / 50hz on the pc control panel ?
will the tv upscale these settings ( 24 / 50hz in pc graphics card control panel ) to 96 / 100hz ?
or will i be stuck with 60hz for pc input ?
96 / 100hz will be fine but i ca n't stand the flicker on 60hz ... i guess these options wont be selectable from the pc control panel ( 96 / 100hz ) ... but will the tv upscale if you select a multiple of these numbers ( 24 / 50hz ) ?
please get back to me if you have tested this because i am close to buying one but this is putting me off !
