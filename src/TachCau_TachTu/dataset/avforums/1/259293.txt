plasma refresh rates on pc .
i have searched but can not find anything on this ... .
i am considering buying a plasma but i hate flickering ... .
if i run a plasma through my pc input -lrb- samsung d550 or d6900 -rrb- which is capable of 96hz/100hz playback , can i run it at these settings on my pc by selecting 24/50hz on the pc control panel ?
will the tv upscale these settings -lrb- 24/50hz in pc graphics card control panel -rrb- to 96/100hz ?
or will i be stuck with 60hz for pc input ?
96/100hz will be fine but i ca n't stand the flicker on 60hz ... i guess these options wont be selectable from the pc control panel -lrb- 96/100hz -rrb- ... but will the tv upscale if you select a multiple of these numbers -lrb- 24/50hz -rrb- ?
please get back to me if you have tested this because i am close to buying one but this is putting me off !
