vt30 & gt30 vibrant setting .
both have it ? .
i saw a 3d avatar demo of the vt30 in the vibrant setting and it blew me away .
it was awesome .
there are no vt30 promotions here ( new york area ) yet and the price is still at full list .
i am considering a gt30 55 " and see that the prices are definitely coming down .
does anyone know if there is a comparable vibrant setting in the gt ?
it would help me decide which to buy .
many thanks .
