is there a 50 " panasonic plasma tv that does nt suffer from screen buzz available yet ? .
hey all i 'm on the look out for a new 50 " panasonic plasma tv ( as i 'm always blown away by the quality of images on the the screens ) .
about a year ago i had a 50 " panasonic plasma tx - p50g20bbut the buzz ( when there were bright white images on the screen ) was just unbearable , so it had to go back to amazon .
i was wondering whats around today that might suit me that does nt have this awful problem ?
thanks
