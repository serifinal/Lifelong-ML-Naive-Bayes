Â£ 800 budget , new 3d tv required . .
we were at some friends house this evening and after about 5 minutes of watching some 3d content the wife would like a 3d tv , am can honestly say i am not to upset about this .
the requirements would be as follows : 42 " or greater 3 hdmi ports bbc iplayer etc / smart tv ?
as for the room it will be going in , we both sit off centre , left and right , about 8 feet away from the tv , we have two windows to the right of the current tv , front right and rear left in terms of surround sound if that makes sense .
nice to have would be 4 hdmi ports but that is not a deal breaker .
over to you .
