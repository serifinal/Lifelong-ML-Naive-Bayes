panasonic 42gt30 hdmi input madness . .
ok i have a panny 42gt30 and an onkyo avr ( nr609 ) .
all is good and i have got the arc working when the tv is in net mode ( bbc iplayer and the like ) .
problem : when the tv starts up , it starts in " internal freesat " mode .
i have changed the prefered mode from tv to av and this works every now and then .
in the manual it says the av will be prefered when a signal is present ( there definitely is ) .
any ideas anyone ?
is there any way to force the tv to start on the last used input ?
tbh it seems a strange way to do things e.g. have the tv default to a freesat internal , rather than default to a " last used " input .
lets be right who is going to pay Â£ 1,000 + for a plasma hd 3d tv to watch freesat ?!?!?!? thanks
