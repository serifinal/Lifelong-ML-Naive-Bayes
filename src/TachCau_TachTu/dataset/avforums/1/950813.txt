samsung ps50b530 .
this is full hd tv is available for Â£ 599 at bennetts with 10 % off if first order .
it seems really cheap for full hd .
i ca n't find any reviews or comments from owners anywhere on the net .
does anyone here own one or has seen one and can give some idea of what it 's like ?
thanks
