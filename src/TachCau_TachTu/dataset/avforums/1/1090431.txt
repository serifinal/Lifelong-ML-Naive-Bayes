is the p42gt30b worth the extra money over p42st30b ?
plus a question about warranty .
narrowed down my search to either the panasonic tx - p42gt30b or panasonic tx - p42st30b .
i was in curry 's today and they all waffle on about this price match in their adverts .
yet when i posed the question about john lewis and richer sounds offering better warranty packages the saleman said they were limited warranty 's they offered .
is this true for even a the 5 year warranty 's they now offer ?
was this basically bs ?
also my other question is that basically i am wondering if the panasonic tx - p42gt30b is worth the extra money over the tx - p42st30b ?
any help would be appreciated .
thanks in advance !
