please recommend a plasma for around Â£ 500 .
hi , i 'm in need of some advice for buying a plasma tv .
at the moment we have a 32 " samsung lcd and a 42 " lg lcd , however i 've been told that as the viewing distance for the new tv will be quite small a plasma would be best .
it will mainly be used for blu ray & gaming .
ideally 42 " or 50 " .
any recomendations ?
