so does n't anybody make a decent 65inch ? .
i 'd really like to upgrade to a 65inch screen .
there does n't seem to be a single tv out there that does n't have major issues .
i do n't mean that no tv has perfect attributes ie contrast etc but issues like fluctuating brightness or peeling screens !
why can nobody make a 65 inch screen that does n't have a major flaw ??
