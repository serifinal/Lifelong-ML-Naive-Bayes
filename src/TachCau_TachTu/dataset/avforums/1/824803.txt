best tv for gaming # 500 - # 600 .
hi everyone , i was on here 1 or 2 years ago asking a similar question to this and ended up getting a panasonic u30 .
i am selling that and i am now looking to upgrade to a better tv .
i will have about # 600 to spend , however and could spend an extra # 100 if needed .
i rarely watch normal sd tv and one of the only things i do is play games -lrb- xbox 360 , ps3 -rrb- i would also like a very good blu-ray picture , but i 'm sure that goes hand in hand with the games .
the reason i got rid of the u30 was because of the horrid jaggy lines .
whatever i did i could n't get rid of them on games so i am looking for a tv with no jaggy lines in gaming -lrb- if possible , if not the least -rrb- and a sharp but natural image .
i believe plasma 's are best for gaming but i am willing to buy and led or lcd .
i do n't care about size .
the one i have at the moment is 42 '' but nothing bigger than that .
my room is quite small so i have to sit quite close to the tv -lrb- about 5 - 6ft away -rrb- .
thanks alot !
