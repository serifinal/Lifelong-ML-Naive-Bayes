50vt30 or 55vt30 .
hi guys well it looks like i 'm going to swap my 50hz buggy vt20 for a vt30 ( hearing from the dealer tomorrow ) quick question . .
should i go for the 50 " again or maybe go up to the 55 " ?
veiwing distance is 9 feet and the online advice seems to say that 55 " is perfect ( distance = double the screen size ) the 50 " seemed huge when we got it to replace our old 42 " so will the 55 " be too much ?
opinions ?
cheers
