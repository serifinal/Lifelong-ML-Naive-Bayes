panasonic th - 50pz80b - today 's equivalent ? .
as an aside to a thread i started about a fault with this set of mine i have been doing some googling as to what the fault might be .
as there is a possibility it could be the panel that has gone , is the g series the nearest equivalent , bearing in mind this tv was one of the better tv 's in their range when i bought it ?
i 'll be dealing with john lewis under their 5 year warranty and will be hoping it can be fixed as i love this tv so much .
but if it is worse case scenario should i be looking at a g model ?
the cheap model they do sounds awful compared to the quality i have been enjoying with this set .
i ca n't see 3d because of an eyesight problem , so have no interest in any of those models at all .
thanks for any input .
