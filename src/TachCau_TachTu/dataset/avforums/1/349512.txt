best plasma to buy .
hi there , i 'm looking to buy a 50 inch or above plasma tv around the # 1000 mark , but idealy i 'd rather pay # 700 - # 800 depending on what you can get .
i 'd be using it for a lot of gaming , blu ray films etc. 3d would also be nice .
so i was just wondering what tv would be best to buy in the uk ?
thanks
