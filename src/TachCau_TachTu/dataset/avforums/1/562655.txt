plasmas above fireplaces .
i have yet to buy a plasma but maybe moving house and would like to mount it above the fireplace , it is a wood burning fireplace set back but can also run a gas type living flame fire , could you mount one there or does it depend on the model , i am looking at the pioneer 435 , what is the operating temps etc on that model ?
has anyone got theirs mounted over the fireplace and is it ok when watching for long periods ?
