lg 50pv350t vs panasonic tx - p50st30 .
hi , i posted yesterday in the ' what tv ' forum to get some advice to start me off , now i think i 've decided on a plasma i 'm looking for more specific advice .
i think i 've narrowed it down to these two , there is £ 100 between them at richer sounds ( the lg being cheaper ) .
i 'm not keen on the look of the panasonic on the photos i 've seen on the web but i think i saw one in store at the weekend , assuming it was the correct model , and it looked ok .
the lg does n't particularly look great either but at least a bit more modern .
obviously , the main priority is picture quality .
i watch mostly football and a bit of xbox gaming , and other than that just normal evening tv .
the football is the main priority , i want that crisp , textured grass you get on football on the top end tv 's , but hopefully without paying top money .
i do n't really want to go higher than the £ 599 for the panasonic , unless there is something considerably better for a little more .
any opinions welcome !
