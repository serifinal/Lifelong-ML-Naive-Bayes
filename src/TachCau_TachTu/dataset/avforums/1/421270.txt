which shop / supplier ?
... jl out of stock .
could i ask for some advice ?
i have a strong desire to buy my new television from john lewis due to their 5 year warranty and good reputation , but unfortunately every model i?m interested in is out of stock - no 37dt30 , 42e30b , 37e30b ?
s in stock?plus i presume jl is a good place to demo each model .
on phoning jl this afternoon they don?t say when they?ll be restocking .
anyway that got me thinking .
which other suppliers would people recommend ?
panasonic shops ( where are they ?
, never having seen one ) may be an option but how about dixon?s , comet , richer sounds , amazon etc. ?
are their prices keen and warranties any good in a crisis ?
thanks in advance everyone
