plasma in conservatory ? .
i am currently getting a rather large conservatory built .
one end is a solid new brick wall , ideal for mounting a plasma on , methinks .
however , by their very nature , conservatories can get pretty hot and humid i guess , so has anyone any idea if this is a bad environment for a plasma , or lcd for that matter .
or does it not matter in the least ?
