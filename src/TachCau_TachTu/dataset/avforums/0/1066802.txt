tv interfering with router ! .
has anyone ever had an issue with their tv interfering with their wireless internet router ?
i bought a samsung ps43d490 yesterday , and since then it 's been interfering with my internet .
it basically makes my router think there is no phone line and no internet .
if i turn the tv off then it 's fine .
it does n't matter where in the house i have the router , or which router i use ( ive tried two different routers ) .
i 've call samsung who have n't been much help .
im at a loss and its really annoying me !
if this can not he resolved then they can have the tv back !
