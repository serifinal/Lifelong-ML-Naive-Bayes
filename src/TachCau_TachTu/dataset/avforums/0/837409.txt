samsung ps42b430 plasma .
hi all is it ok to turn the switch off at the wall every night for my samsung ps42b430 plasma ?
i turn the tv off via the touch button on the front , but the red power light stays on , there is no on / off physical switch , and so i have been turning the switch off as well . .
whats your thoughts ?
cheers steve
