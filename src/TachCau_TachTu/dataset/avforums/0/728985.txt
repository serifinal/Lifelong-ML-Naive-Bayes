lg 60pz250t freezes .
hi .
i just bought a 60pz250t today , connected it up to my sky + hd box via hdmi and everything was fine for the fiirst couple of hours .
then the picture on the screen froze however i could still hear the audio .
i tried changing the channels with my sky remote and the audio of the channel was changing , however the picture remain frozen .
i then pressed the standby button on the lg remote control but it did nt work .
in fact none of the buttons on the lg remote were working .
i switched the tv off from the power and then back on .
everything was fine for about an hour and then the same thing happened again .
i switched the power off and on again .
everything was ok for about 15 minutes , then same thing again .
i switched the power off again and immediately after switching the tv back on it froze .
i have now turned the tv off from the power and havent bothered switching it back on since .
i 'm preety sure the issue is with the tv as i have connected my sky box ( using same hdmi cable ) to another tv and it works fine .
also the fact that the tv stops responding to the remote control points towards a problem with the tv .
i 'm not sure whether to restore to factory settings and update software or just tell currys to fix it or replace .
any ideas ?
