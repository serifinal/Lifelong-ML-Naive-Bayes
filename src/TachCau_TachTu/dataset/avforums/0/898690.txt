can having tv in open plan kitchen / lounge damage it ? .
hi all , i am looking to move into an open plan kitchen / lounge property and just wondering , if having my beloved plasma ( pio 5090 ) next to kitchen can damage its screen or inside electronics ?
i would rather not take risks , if you know what i mean ... any advice is appreciated .
cheers .
