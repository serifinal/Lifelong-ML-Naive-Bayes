jvc pd42b50bj standby blue light flashing .
please help , i 'm new here and after some advice / assistance and would be grateful if anyone can assist .
i have a jvc plasma pd42b50bj that 's decided suddenly not to work .
on switching the power on there is no sound or display and only the blue standby light on the front flashes .
i 'd like to know if a new power board or any other replacement part is required and if so where i can purchase .
i have tried disconnecting the power for 24 hrs and then attempted to switch it back on and have the same problem .
i have also taken the back panel off as i was asked who the manufacturer of the boards inside were and there are a number of boards with samsung printed on them .
thank you for any advice .
