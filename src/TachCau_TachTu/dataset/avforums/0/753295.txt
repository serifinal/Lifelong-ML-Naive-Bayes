why do black bars cause i / r ? .
if im right in thinking i / r is caused by the pixels being constanly illuminated at the same brightness , now my question is that when a plasma displays blacks the pixels are turned off so if this is correct why do we get i / r from black bars when that part of the screen is turned off ?
