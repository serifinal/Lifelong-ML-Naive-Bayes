panasonic 42g30b flicker strobe effect .
just bought a brand new 42g30b and i have noticed this horrible flicker / strobe effect when there are large blocks of the same colour .
it 's almost unwatchable as it hurts your eyes after a while .
i assume this is not the brightness problem i have seen people talk about , this is not gradual , but a fast strobe effect .
i have noticed that this is present in normal and dynamic , but not cinema or the professional modes , slightly in thx mode though .
all the other settings appear to make no difference .
obviously i can use cinema mode but i do n't see why it should be going on in the other modes .
i assume this is not supposed to do this , my friends g10 and vt20 which are similar do n't have this problem going on .
will it get better over time ?
does it need running in ?
i spoke to panasonic and they suggested a software update , i have 12.04 , and they are sending me 12.10 to try .
the easiest place to see it is to go to the set up menu and select the update option , when the update screen is present there is a bar in the middle and a large grey square covering most of the screen , this flickers like mad .
thanks gary
