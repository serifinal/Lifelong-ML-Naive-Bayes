panasonic gt30 46 " rant .
well , i got this tv last week after reading rave reviews , to replace a faulty sony ( that i was otherwise very happy with ) .
what can i say ?
not acceptable for such an expensive tv .
- brightness goes up and down on its own , seemingly at random .
- severe colour banding - some really strange motion handling problems , especially on hd channels .
- flickers like mad .
i know plasmas all flicker a bit but my old crt 15 years ago was better than this .
i have tried to contact panasonic by email , no answer after 4 days .
have also tried to call them but i just get a recorded message asking me to stay on the line if i would like to talk to them about a kitchen appliance , otherwise they are shut !!
i am going to call currys tomorrow and try to arrange a swap plus extra money for a sony hx823 46 " .
this will be the third telly i have returned to them as faulty so i hope they do n't think of me as a crank just reckon i should get a telly without major problems if i 'm spending that much £ £ £ £ rant over .
