`` buzzing '' sound from the tv .
i have just got a - samsung ps43d490 -lrb- further info-samsung ps43d490 | 43 inch 3d plasma tv hd ready freeview | richer sounds -rrb- i am hearing a `` buzzing '' sound from the tv .
i hear this even when the sound is muted so i am confident that it is not from the speakers .
my friend can barely hear it but i detect it at all times unless there is music playing or the volume is loud , if i do this , as soon as there is a gap in the noise i can hear the buzzing .
sometimes i just want the tv on with low volume in the background but this noise is making it very iritating - surely this is not right .
before i call richer sounds is there anything i need to do or check in the settings ?
any help advice appreciated .
jim .
