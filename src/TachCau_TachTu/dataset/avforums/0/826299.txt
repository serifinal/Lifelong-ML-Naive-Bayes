lg 50ps6000 firmware problem ? .
hi all , i have tried searching for this problem but can not find anything so any help would be greatfully appreciated .
i have a 50 " lg plasma tv ( 50ps6000 ) which decided to have a funny turn by changing it 's language and locking out the remote control .
after changing the language back to english from the side of the tv i found that the message flashing up on the screen read " input blocked " .
unfortunately i could not enter the passcode as the remote control was still locked out .
i downloaded the latest firmware for the tv ( v3 .45 ) , which strangely enough is no longer available !
, installed it and the tv and remote control were now both working normally again , except that the colours are now hideous , standard , vivid , cinema etc are bright green , purple or turquoise .
i can play with the colour settings but they still look awful .
and if i want to watch something through a usb stick , it is in bright green as well with no way to change the colour settings as it throws you out of the film i am trying to watch .
the tv is 2 years old and out of its warranty .
so the big question is , am i able to " rollback " the firmware to an earlier one and if so , where can i get a copy ?
hopefully someone out there has had a similar problem or knows of a solution , please help !
kindest regards david
