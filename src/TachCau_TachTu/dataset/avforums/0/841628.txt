any difference between tx - p50st30 and tx - p50st30b .
hi all , do you know any difference between tx - p50st30 and tx - p50st30b by any chance ?
i ve just found a piece of article saying the " b " mean the tv is for the british market but still wonder whether there would be any difference between models depending the markets they would be designated to ?
anyone got an idea ?
thanks
