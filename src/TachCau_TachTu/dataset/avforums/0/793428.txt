how to break my philips 6 year old plasma ? .
ok this is probably a wierd request but here is the deal : i used to have an 60 " lg which was fantastic ( plasma ) but around 14 months of age it broke , i contacted comet who sent out the repair guy who obviously knew nothing because he said it was the panel and would cost £ 1500 to fix .
i sold it on ebay and the guy fixed it with a £ 70 buffer board i could not afford to buy another 60 " so ended up with a 46 " samsung led whilst offering perfect picture its not the cinema experience i crave !
in my other room i have my old faithfull ( 6 year old ) 42 " philips .
so ... .
my wife wont allow me to go an indulge in a new tv as she says the ones we have are fine , but i want to go back to a 59 " or 60 " plasma for the main room .
so my idea is take down the 42 , open it up do something to the inside to give it a nasty looking screen fault or similar , then move the 46 " to the back room and buy a new 59/60 for the front room devious i know but its only way i would get a new tv !
then i could probably fix the 42 " and throw it in the bedroom or one of the kids rooms any guidelines as the best way to stop the philips working without irreversably killing it would be great .
thanks .
