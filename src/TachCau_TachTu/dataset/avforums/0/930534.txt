tv image flickers p42g10 with ps3 .
for a little while i noticed my panasonic plasma 42 flickered whilst on the ps3 ( input via hdmi ) , but never off the panny dvd player or sky ( input by scart ) .
therefore wasn?t sure if it was the ps3 doing it , or the hdmi ports in the tv .
well , last night enough was enough because the flickering went from one each hour to happening every minute , sometimes twice a minute .
i originally thought its maybe the tv being the cause , as often when it jumps , it doesn?t just judder the picture but it also forces an aspect ratio change .
i have my tv set to 16:9 ( not wide or auto ) .
but the problem occurs often whereby it changes the aspect by its self ; going from 16:9 to wide ( possibly caused by bad information sent by ps3 ? ) .
in doing so , it takes about 1.5 seconds , and gives me a blank black screen ; so obviously impossible to game or watch bluray - dvd 's .
but coincidently i noticed my dad?s brand new panny 46 ?
( 400hz s10 ) also jumps about aspect ratio when playing dvd?s that income from hdmi via an arcam amp ( but only does so very rarely ) ; so maybe it is the tv .
my tv is less than 1 year old .
on the title screen of the ps3 ?
a static image ?
i can see lines of snowing or breaking up intermittently ; but this does not occur on the av1 av2 etc channels , just the hdmi .
leave it a while and the screen begins to jump about .
this happens on all 3 of the hdmi in ports on the tv .
so i?m inclined to think it?s the source that maybe the problem , not the tv .
so tried a spare hdmi cable ; that too is problematic ; so maybe its the actual source , the ps3 ?
unfortunately i have no other hdmi source boxes ; no spare ps3 or anything .
without that test i can?t tell if it?s the ps3 ; i was thinking of finding someone with a hdmi tv and plugging my ps3 into it .
before doing so : has anyone else had an issue with their tv picture jumping about when plugged into a ps3 ?
