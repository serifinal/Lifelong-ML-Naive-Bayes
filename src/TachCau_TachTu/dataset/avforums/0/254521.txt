panasonic tx42g30 plasma - bluray worse than dvd .
hi , need some help please .
i have tried google but no luck .
this forum is the closest i could find .
problem i have is my panasonic plasma .
it plays games great , dvds great , but now i have tried a bluray ' skyline ' through my ps3 and i 'm not exaggerating when i say it looks a lot worse than dvd .
dvd looks fine like a normal dvd but my bluray looks like a decent youtube video , its fuzzy , pixelated and has motion blur on faces and things .
maybe i 'm being slightly fussy but it seems to make no sense to me to buy a bluray when dvd has much better quality .
i know i must be doing something wrong as a dvd shouldnt be better than bluray but i tried messing around with all the options and cant seem to solve it .
any help would be much apprciated .
