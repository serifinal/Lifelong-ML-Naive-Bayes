hitachi 42pd7200 died ! .
my hitachi 42pd7200 was working fine a few days ago and as always i turn it off via the right hand power switch .
anyway , i go away for a few days , come back today , try and turn it on and ..... dead as a doornail !!
there was no obvious sign of anything going wrong either .
no popping , no smoke , no billowing flames !!
i checked the power cable to see if it had come loose .... nope !
i also changed the fuse twice just to make sure .
still nothing ... no power light !
apologies , but i 'm a bit of a noob on the technical side of this tv and being it 's just turned 15 months old , it 's warranty has expired and i 'm hoping there is an easy solution to getting it working again .
i have sky hd plugged into it via an octava switch and i hope it 's not a case of the vindictive little sky box thinking it would fry my tv rather than just the hdcp board !
i 've came across threads saying there is an internal 20 mm fuse .
is this true ?
any advice would be appreciated guys
