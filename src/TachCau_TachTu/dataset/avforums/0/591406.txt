pioneer pdp - 5040hd shuts off when receiver is plugged in .
someone gave me a pdp - 504pu / pdp - 5040hd without the receiver .
i found a pdp - r03u on craigslist without reading that they might not work together .
will this receiver work with my display ?
the problem i 'm having is that when i have the system cables connected and i plug the power cable for the receiver into the wall , the standby light on the tv turns off and wo n't turn on .
any suggestions ?
