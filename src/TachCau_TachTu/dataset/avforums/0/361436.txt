blue / purple lines .
i have a 58 " samsung plasma tv and recently i have noticed that on light colored screens ( full white shows the effect worse than any others ) , there are blue / purple horizontal lines on the screen they do n't cover the whole screen and do n't follow any discernible pattern , i have no idea what could be causing this , also when in the menu screens for the tv the problem disappears , adjusting certain settings can lessen the effect but not completely has anyone got any ideas .
thanks in advance for any help .
