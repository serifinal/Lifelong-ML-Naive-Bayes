[ help ] panasonic g30 self - check fail - sum 9029 .
has anyone tried the panasonic self - check on their plasma ?
i tried the panasonic self - check on my new g30 ( by holding down v - on tv while pressing the menu button on remote ) .
almost immediately , the screen showed that the self check had failed with " 9029 " in red .
the 9029 appeared on the right hand side of the screen next to " sum " ( see attachment ) .
i then had to then press the on / off switch on the tv , to exit the self - check screen .
the self - check also reset my g30 settings to factory default , so had to re-input personal data into tv .
if anyone knows what " sum " or " 9029 " refers to in the self - check , i 'd appreciate their help with this .
the tv is new and am happy with it , except that the self - check should be coming back with a pass surely ?
should i contact the shop i bought the tv from , or contact panasonic ?
