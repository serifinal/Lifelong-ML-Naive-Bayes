pioneer 8g owners thread .
ok by request here we go .
more later lets keep in in one thread so we can all help each other and just look in one place of reference .
i have now attached 6 sets of setting text files for each type of source as promised , this is a calaboration between myself and andrew fee .
the hdmi settings are perfect d65 , the others track the hdmi setting as close posible we found differences between sources using scart .
there are 2 scart settings , try them both but the sky one works for sky sd .
check back weekly as they may change , the first line is the date they were issued .
amended 22nd february 2008 sony ps3 settings text file added the hdmi video setting of auto will now work as sony have fixed a bug with the ps3 .
