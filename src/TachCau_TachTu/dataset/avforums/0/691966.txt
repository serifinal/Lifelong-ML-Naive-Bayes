panasonic st30 plasma help ! .
the tv has the latest firmware .
how do i get the tv to remember my picture overscan setting on different channel inputs .
i do nt want to change the setting manually everytime i change input .
i want it to set to off on hdmi / freeview hd and on while watching freeview sd .
my old g10 could remember the setting .
how do i check on the tv how many hours i did ?
what is the best unofficial 3d glasses for the tv and will the 3d picture quality be the same as the official latest panasonic ones ?
will i get phospor trails if i do nt keep the phospors in good condition or exercise them properly during the first 200 hours break in ?
whats the worst that can happen apart from ir and screen burn if i do nt follow the 200 hour break in rule ?
is it ok to watch films with black bars during break in when using low settings like true cinema mode ?
i tried answering these questions in the st30 owners thread but all i was getting was feedback on john lewis customer services
