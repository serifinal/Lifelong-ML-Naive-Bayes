broken lg 50pc1d .
hi , our plasma tv decided to stop working last night it has sound but no picture i have included a video of what it is doing & #x202a ; brokentv & #x202c ; & rlm ; - youtube we got the tv in november 2006 so its not that old .
i thought i would ask on here first rather than call out an engineer so see if it is a easy fix and how might it might cost as if it is too expensive id much rather update to a newer tv .
hopefully you are able to help
