does your 2011 panasonic plasma suffer from the green " blob " issue ? .
i thought i 'd start a poll to get a rough idea of how many panasonic sets have suffered from the " dreaded blob " .
obviously this wo n't be an accurate representation of how many have actually been affected all over , but it will help give a rough idea .
in my mind if for example over 90 % of people on this forum have suffered from it then i 'd say it might not be a good sign ( unless it 's just those that have suffered that vote ) anyway have you suffered from the green blob ?
discussion of the issue can be found here : green tinge fault - panasonic ( vt30 , gt30 and st30 ) * part 2 *
