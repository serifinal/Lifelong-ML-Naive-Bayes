panasonic viera p42v20b issue .
hi i 've had this tv for a few months now and so have finally decided to ask your opinion on what my issue may be .
when watching sky channels or sky hd the picture leaves a slight pixelated trail behind fairly fast moving images .
i say fast moving images but it could be a fairly slow panning shot .
is this what is meant by ghosting ?
i thought this tv was good for not doing that ?
it does n't do it when playing blurays through my home cinema system .
could this be a sky reception issue ?
my input 1 signal strength is full and the quality is a tiny bit off of full .
not sure if this matters but my input 2 signal strength is next to nothing and the signal 2 quality is about 3/4 full .
any ideas ?
thanks in advance
