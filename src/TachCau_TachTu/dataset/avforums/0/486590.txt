analysis of viera cast .
so , viera cast ( apart from the dlna streaming ) is a bit bland , so i wondered whether it 'd be possible to hijack it and do something more interesting .
it 's early days yet , but i wanted to get the ball rolling the first thing to do is set up a sniffer or proxy so that you can see what it 's downloading , and to extract the user agent string .
here 's the first few things it asks for head http://vieracast.eu/test get http://vieracast.eu/data/home-screen.js get http://vieracast.eu/data/common/gradation_v.png ... the home - screen.js gives me " denied " when i try and access with firefox , so i will need the user - agent switcher : https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/59 for me , vieracast.eu resolves to 83.231.191.161 , and there appears to be a vieracast.com on 85.233.160.22 so i shall see if faking the dns gives me anything interesting .
more to follow , but i just wanted to wet people 's appetite
