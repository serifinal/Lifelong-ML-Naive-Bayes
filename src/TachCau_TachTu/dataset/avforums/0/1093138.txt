poor picture on tx-p42530b ? .
hi i bought my son a panasonic tx-p42530b tv for xmas and he has been complaining of a poor picture quality , i today finally got round to taking a look and i have to say he 's correct the image , particularly the dark colours , appear to have a lot of `` noise '' like fussy , shimmering effect .
i 've looked on my other tv 's and they certainly do n't have this effect , even my cheap techwood appears to have solid blocks of colour .
any thoughts ?
andy
