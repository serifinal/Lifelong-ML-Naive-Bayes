wiki on hdtv 1:1 pixelmapping .
hi , like alot of other people ive been getting very frustrated about the lack of information about exactly which hdtv 's ( both rp , plasma and lcd ) actually support recieving a video signal from a pc over dvi - hdmi ( or failing that , vga ) at the tvs native resolution displaying it without scaling or overscan .
i thought it would be a good idead to create a website to hold such information .
towards that end i have created a wiki at wikispaces.com called pixelmapping.wikispaces.com in which i hope to create an up - to - date view on what is known about this topic so far .
its a public wiki meaning everybody can edit it ( no registration / login required ) .
i have added a little basic information myself , and hope that others will help add information on more tvs .
just in this forum i can already tell that there is alot of information on some specific tvs , so lets help each other out by summarising this information , so that people do nt have to check 50 forums on the net and read 500 posts long threads to find out whether a given tv supports 1:1 pixelmapping .
other information regarding displays for htpcs etc , are also welcome .
its all very much a work in progress the wiki is available at : http://pixelmapping.wikispaces.com [ note : this also posted in lcd forum , which is technically a crosspost , but it applies evenly well in both places .
see fit to move / delete as appropiate ]
