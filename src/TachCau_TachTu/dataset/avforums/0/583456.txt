possible issue with samsung d8000 cell light in game mode ? .
hi guys , i have a samsung ps51d8000 and was just tinkering with my picture settings whilst i was on the xbox dashboard .
i turned on ' game ' mode and whilst i ca n't remember what the default cell light is for this mode , i noticed that no matter what number i chose from 9 onwards , the light did not get any brighter ??? this is n't necessarily an issue as 9 in ' game ' mode seems more than enough so i can only assume that this mode possibly maxes it to this number behind the scenes but i was wondering whether any of you people had also noticed this ?
i 'm not a tv whizz so please forgive me if i 've missed something !!!
cheers .
