samsung d8000 bad ir of channel logo .
hi guys , i have a samsung d8000 and 2 days ago i noticed the shadow of one ( actually 2 ) channel logo 's in the top left of my screen .
the tv is some 8 weeks old now .
the contrast wasnt very high ( like 60 ) .
scared that i ruined my tv i ran the screen wash 1 night and some repair dvd with colour snow i downloaded the other night .
it has now faded alot , though i can still see the shadow in a light background .
offcourse the contrast now is even more down ( the 2 channels have very bright logo 's ) and atm i am watching some full screen series without statics with contrast and colour put to full to see if that helps .
it seems that although it has faded a lot , that what remains is very persistant .
i 'm pretty sure it is n't burned in , but bad retention aka premature cell aging .
so if i understand it correctly the rest of the panel will catch up with it eventually ?
hope someone has had this before and can put me at ease cause some voice in my head keeps saying that i ruined my new tv ... thanks in advance !
