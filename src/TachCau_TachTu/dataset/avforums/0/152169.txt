plasma vs lcd / led , im confused ? .
i thought plasma was bad ?
i have always been warned by shop staff to avoid plasma like the plague !
because its unsafe for in your house , and if you put it on pause for evan half an hour its stains the screen forever ?
then all of a sudden you rarley found a plasma screen , and now the past year it seems to have made a huge comeback , is it any better now ?
whats better and whats worse about it than lcd / led ?
i do like to put my tv on pause quick alot , would this stain the screen ?
please help ?!?! thanks
