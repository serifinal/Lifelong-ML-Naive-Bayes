samsung 50 '' plasma tv .
could somebody tell me the model number .
hi , i have put my tv up on the wall in my new house and i do n't know the model number since i moved house i have lost the book i also removed the sticker on the right hand side of the tv so i can not get it that way either i ca n't get the tv back off the wall to get to the sticker on the back because im on my own now .
the tv has got another number on the left hand side aswell which is ps bn64 00633c if that helps .
