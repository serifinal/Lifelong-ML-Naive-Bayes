panasonic gt30 - is there a menu to see how long the screens been on for ? .
i have heard that some tv 's have this feature in the maintanance section .
im currently burning in my tv and have kind of lost count of how long its been running for lol ive looked around but cant see one .
however my last tv had a ' hidden ' section that you have to put in a special code to access .
is there one for the gt30 ?
