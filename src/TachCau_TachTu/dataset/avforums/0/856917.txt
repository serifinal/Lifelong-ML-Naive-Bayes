ok guys , those that have posted can you please add if you have contacted panasonic via email .
if you havent done this can you please do so .
i do nt mean to sound bossy or to tell you all what to do , but this is the only way to get attention .
we have 58 posters here , if we all mail panasonic it should get their attention at least .
