hd fury 4 aka 3dfury .
not sure if this is the right place to post this but theres prolly a few non 3d ready plasma owners like me who dont wana upgrade just for 3d .
the makers of hd fury are releasing hdfury4/3dfury this month .
hdfury.com no idea how this compares to 3d theater .
also seems somewhat bulky compared to hd fury which is more or less hidden when plugged into the vga port on my 42phd8
