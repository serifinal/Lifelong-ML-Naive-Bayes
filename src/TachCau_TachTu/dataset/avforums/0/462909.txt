anyone good with pioneer model numbers ?
500a / 500p .
just want to clarify what model tv my friend has .
on the back of the tv it states krp - 500p , although he believes it is a krp - 500a .
there is nothing on the box and i can not find anything referring to a 500p online .
any ideas how i can check ?
cheers
