advice needed & much obliged .
hi i have an lg50ps3000 , which was bought last year in jan10 .
in may a line appeared on the panel like a screen burn .
i took it to a tv repair guy who took it away .
he said he 's not seen anything like it and was consulting with lg .
after 2 wks he brought it back and said the panel is bust , however , as it 's fairly new i should contact lg .
i did and they in - turn contacted the tv repair guy and it now turns out that he never opened the tv , which must be done and a proper engineers report completed .
how much do these usually cost and should i do this considering what the tv repair guy told me he allegedly spoke to lg to dissect what was wrong with it , as he could n't be sure for sure it was the panel ?
thx
