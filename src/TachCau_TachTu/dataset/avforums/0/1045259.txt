panasonic tx-p42st30b buzzing noise ?? .
ok , ive already sent the samsung ps43d450 back because of this !
ive had the st30 2 days and its driving me crazy . .
does anyone know if its supposed to do this ?
therefore something ill have to get used too . .
or is it faulty ??
i bought it off amazon for # 450 : http://www.amazon.co.uk/panasonic-tx...3981026&sr=8-1 my old samsung le37r87bdx didnt make a decibal of noise at all !!
why do companies make tvs that buzz if you can make one that doesnt !??? its a shame because the tv is great . .
minus the noise it makes !!
i have no idea how anyone finds this tolerant . .
any comments or help would be appreciated . .
