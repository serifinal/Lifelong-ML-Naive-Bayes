panasonic v10 black problem but under gaurantee .
any help appreciated , as title says have a panasonic v10 42 " and overnight the black levels have rocketed which is very noticeable and makes dark scenes / films hard to discern .
i bought it january 2010 from tec7 so i got a 5 year guarantee but it was the display model .
apologise if this has been asked before but is there anything i can do about it ?
as it 's under guarantee will they replace / repair it or is it a case of having to get used to it ?
as i said apologise if this has been asked before and appreciate any help .
