do phosphor trails diminish over time ? .
i 've been searching the forums and elsewhere for a while now and have n't found a definitive answer .
phosphor trails were one of the first things i noticed on my new gt30 , but i did n't know what it was and assumed it was some artifact related to moving high contrast windows on my pc .
i did n't actually notice it anywhere else until i saw it on clarkson 's jacket & shirt on top gear the other day , and it 's almost painful in that kind of situation .
strange thing is , contrary to my understanding of the issue , yellow seems to be the leading edge with blue trailing .
so aside from me getting accustomed to it , does a pdp 's tendency to display plainbows improve as it beds in ?
also , does it vary much from panel to panel ?
( for the same model )
