pc - > tv : pq of content streamed via network vs pq of content sent via ` monitor cable ' .
hi videophiles - first time poster here .
just got my first-ever flat screen -lrb- samsung ps51d550 -rrb- and have connected it to a recently-built pc .
-lrb- this connexion will shortly be via hdmi . -rrb-
when i have some content on blu-ray i 'll use my computer 's bd-rom to access it .
what i 'm wondering is whether i 'm better off streaming content on blu-ray to the tv via the network the set 's plugged in to , or better off using any old media playing-application to play the content on the default computer monitor -lrb- which happens to be the plasma tv -rrb- .
the ` picture mode ' changes from ` movie ' to ` entertain ' when changing source from ` tv ' to ` pc ' , and this has me thinking -lrb- until i investigate calibration , at least -rrb- that i 'd be better off streaming .
appreciate any advice sent this newbie 's way !
