pc - > tv : pq of content streamed via network vs pq of content sent via ' monitor cable ' .
hi videophiles - first time poster here .
just got my first - ever flat screen ( samsung ps51d550 ) and have connected it to a recently - built pc .
( this connexion will shortly be via hdmi . )
when i have some content on blu - ray i 'll use my computer 's bd - rom to access it .
what i 'm wondering is whether i 'm better off streaming content on blu - ray to the tv via the network the set 's plugged in to , or better off using any old media playing - application to play the content on the default computer monitor ( which happens to be the plasma tv ) .
the ' picture mode ' changes from ' movie ' to ' entertain ' when changing source from ' tv ' to ' pc ' , and this has me thinking ( until i investigate calibration , at least ) that i 'd be better off streaming .
appreciate any advice sent this newbie 's way !
