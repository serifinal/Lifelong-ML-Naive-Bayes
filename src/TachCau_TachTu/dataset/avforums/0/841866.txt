panasonic 50hz bug , how do you get round it ? .
i was wondering to anyone who has a panasonic plasma 2010 or 2011 if it 's still here how do you get around this awful 50hz bug or do you just put up with it .
i have the lowest of the range c2 2010 model which in 50hz mode is pretty bad to my eyes with splitting images on pans and green trails on faces ( not the normal phosphor trailing but an extra one ) .
i heard ifc helps but i do not have that option on the lower model .
i originally was going to use the tv as a big pc monitor which it has been pretty good for because 60hz gets around the problem .
i use a dvb s2 card for the pc and get good results it 's just a pity 50hz is ruined by this bug .
it does not look like panasonic are going to fix it so is there a solution of running a satellite box which does 60hz .
it would be nice to find something that used very little power similar to a freesat hd box but could run at 60hz like the pc dvb - s2 card but was only around £ 100 - £ 150 .
is there something anyone has done like that or found another solution other than getting rid of it and buying another plasma .
it really is a shameful thing for panasonic to do especially if people are only using it for tv in the uk .
only for the fact i can use it in 60hz for my pc i could not put up with it , it 's that bad to my eyes .
