blury shadows on plasma tv .
hi , we got panasonic tx-p50v20ba last christmas .
it seems to be good tv but i have one think i would like to ask you about .
when watching something like eagle flying in front of clif or runner in front of the fence or similar scenario of moving object in front of detailed background i can see blury shadows on the background .
only little `` shadows '' kind of like what you see thru hot air .
i am pretty sure you know what i mean but i am not too familiar with corect wording for this issue .
-lrb- as i am czech and going in to some technical details and wording gets a bit too much for me -rrb- i would like to know if that is something that i will have to put up with for live of the tv as the technology simply is not good enough to generate sharply detailed pictures -lrb- in shoots like mentioned above -rrb- or if i can adjust it somehow .
please excuse me if you have already mentioned this somewhere .
if thats the case please give me the correct wording for the problem and directions/link where i can read how to reduce it -lrb- if possible -rrb- .
many thanx and happy christmas
