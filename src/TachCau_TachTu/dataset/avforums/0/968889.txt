plasmas .
hi ive never had a plasma before but bought a 5 inch panasonic plamsa last week and probably have 65 hours use .
im just wondering does the picture improve the more use it gets and beds in .
the reason i ask is that i keep adjusting the picture settings as the image appears to keep changing plus remember my old dlp sagem got better after several weeks usage .
