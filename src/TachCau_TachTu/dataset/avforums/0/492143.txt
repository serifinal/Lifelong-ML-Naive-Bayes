panasonic g10 .
hi guys .
i just got the sky hd box today and subscription today and have a few questions for ideal picture settings on the pansonic 42 inch g10 1 .
for the hd channels what are the recommended picture settings ?
2 .
the regular sd channel picture do nt seem to be as good under the hdmi port .
so does one normally just switch back to av 1 when watching regular channels .
sounds like a dumb question i know however when i switch back to regular the picture is better but i have a broken white line at the top of the screen at the mo ?
any suggestions ?
thanks bryan
