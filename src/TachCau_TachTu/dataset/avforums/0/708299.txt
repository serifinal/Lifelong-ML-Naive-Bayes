panasonic 46 " g20 .
bought mine from richer sounds about 6 weeks ago .
it was the display model .
however , due to house decoration it has been kept in it 's box .
during the last two weeks , it 's been unpacked and in use .
no buzzing , no floating blacks and no posterization .
in fact it 's been a joy to watch , what a clarity of picture , it 's almost 3d .
indeed today i watched avatar on bluray and it was magnificent .
this is truly a great tv .
i took out the five year warranty from rs , well you ca n't be too careful , can you ?
