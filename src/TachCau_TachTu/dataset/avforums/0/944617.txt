panasonic 2011 fluctuating brightness thread .
ive made this thread to be a central hub for all fbr talks .
i will try and keep this first post updated with the names of those effected by fbr 's , if they got fixed by a fw update issued by panasonic ( please no unofficial fw posts it will add to the confusion ) or if your set does nt have any at all without updates .
please post your model number and screen size .
eg 55 " vt30 , and the production date normally found at the back of the tv on the right hand side in one of the vent holes .
will try and post pictures for the vt30 later as to where this is .
also the firmware version of the set .
