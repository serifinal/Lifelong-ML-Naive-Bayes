panasonic g10 50 problems .
hi all i bought a panasoinc g10 50 " from sound and vision in bolton in jan 2010 with a 5 year garantee .
i use it with my sky hd box on a atacama pole stand my tv has now developed a loud electronic buzz which seems to be getting louder .
i phoned sound and vision to find out that the original company i bought the tv off has gone bust and the new owners are not hounouring the warrenty .
where to i stand with this the problem with the tv is really annoying but to be told it is not covered by anyones warrenty has really annoyed me .
is this problem common with these tv 's ?
