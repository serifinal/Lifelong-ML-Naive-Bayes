panasonic viera txp46g20 - does not switch on .
flashing red light .
i bought a panasonic viera txp46g20 from richer sounds 3 weeks ago but i have only used it 3 times since then as have been decorating .
i have plugged it in tonight and pressed the on / off button but the set does not switch on .
the screnn flashes like it is about to start but then the green light on the front is replaced by a red light .
this red light flashes eight times then stops for about 3 seconds before repeating the sequence .
what does this mean ??
i have unplugged and switched on and off a few times and the same thing happens .
