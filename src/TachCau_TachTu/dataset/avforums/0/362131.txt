vt30 - want to use more than one scart device ? .
hi , ive had a look through the manual and from what i can tell the vt30 only has one scart socket via an adaptor cable .
what do i do when i have a dvd player and a humax pvr that both connect via scart ?
can i not plug them both in at the same time ?
cheers
