fans getting louder on panny vt20 .
i picked up the p50vt20b last november , and so far it 's been fantastic .
however , in the last week or so , the fans have gotten noticeably louder and it 's not a constant sound , more a harmonic wave sound which makes it more noticeable still !
just wanted to check if anyone else has come across this before i call costco concierge services to get them to come have a look !
