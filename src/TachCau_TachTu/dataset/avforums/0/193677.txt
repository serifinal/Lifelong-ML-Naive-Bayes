lg plasma pink interference .
hi all , i have a 2 year old lg 42pq6000 plasma tv that has developed a strange fault over the last month or 2 .
it has started to show a pinkish haze in the top left hand section of the screen ( not all the time ) .
i do n't know if this is interference or not .
i normally notice it when there is or has been very bright colours on the screen .
or when i 'm playing my xbox and , for example , i am playing a football game and the score bar on the top left is very faintly left in a pink haze after the screen changes to another area .
very hard to describe amd i 'm probably not doing a very good job !!
could the power and hdmi , scart , antena cable etc be too close together ?
does it need re-gassing or is it kn@ckered !
this is my first post so be gentle about the poor description ... .
cheers dave
