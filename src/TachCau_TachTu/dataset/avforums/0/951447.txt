how can i tell if my tv has `` arc '' or `` hdmi control '' ? .
i just purchased a yamaha 671 av receiver .
i have connected that to my tv but am struggling with the hdmi management .
the instructions booklet of the yamaha says that i should connect to the tv using different method depending on whether the tv is equipped with arc -lrb- audio return channel -rrb- or hdmi control ... how can i tell if my tv is equipped with either of these ?
the tv is a panasonic th-46pz80 thanks
