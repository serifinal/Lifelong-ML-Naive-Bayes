vt30 & usb hdd recording .
bit of a long one but please bear with me ... .
just plugged in and set up my usb powered external hdd to record a bbc1 on freeview .
as it was dinner time i let the tv be to carry on .
on returning from dinner i went to see if programme had been recorded .
located media layer but it could not find the usb hdd .
i had to un plugged the usb and re plugged and hey presto it had recorded .
my question / problem is ?
1 .
will this happen all the time having to un plug and plug the hdd 2 .
am i better off getting a mains power hdd that will not require me to un plug and plug the hdd hope this makes some sort of sense to you all
