panasonic tv will not connect to laptop .
hi , i have a pansonic viera tx - p50g10b flat screen and for the past 6 months hooked my laptop up to the vga port and all worked fine .
for some reason is has stopped working and does not recognise my laptop is connected .
i have tried 2 different vga cables and 2 other laptops and still no joy .
is there a certain set up that may have changed on the tv itself ??
kind regards griff
