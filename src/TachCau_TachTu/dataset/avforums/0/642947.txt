pioneer 5090 and sc - lx83 settings .
i recently upgraded from my arcam av amp and pioneer 51fd blu - ray .
i use to go directly from the 51fd via hdmi to my 5090 plasma and was very happy , however since upgrading to a sc - lx83 av amp and lx54 blu - ray , whilst i am still happy i ca n't help feel the picture has changed slightly .
now i 'm not sure if this is because of a change in source i.e the lx54 , or the fact i come out of the lx54 into the amp then into the tv ?
which is doing the processing now the amp or the tv ?
should i alter any settings or do anything different ?
also where can i find the bumtious settings ?
ca n't seem to locate them .
thanks .
