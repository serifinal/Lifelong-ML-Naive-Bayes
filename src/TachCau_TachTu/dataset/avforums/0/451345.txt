screen on lg plasma cracks by itself .
hi , on saturday the screen on our lg pq2000 plasma cracked by itself and without warning .
the tv was switched on and being used to listen to the radio when without warning the it made a popping noise followed by hissing and when i looked towards it the screen was cracked .
there was no one else in the room and i was no where near the tv when it happened .
the pictures show the cracks which under close inspection reveal it is the inner glass which has cracked and not the outer .
the tv has not been moved or laid flat or disturbed in any other way .
the warranty has expired as the set is just over 12 months old .
does anyone know what the legal situation regarding this problem may be ?
the tv is not used a great deal as i have a projector for my main viewing and it is in immaculate condition with no impact marks or scratches etc. .
