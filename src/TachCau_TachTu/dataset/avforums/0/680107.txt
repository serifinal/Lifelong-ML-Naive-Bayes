with this display we?re bringing broadcast - level technology into the home to deliver an exceptional viewing experience that delivers realistic 3d images .
however , the variety of features and size enable other industries such as post production , retail , design and simulation to use it .
we?re continuing to develop technology that appeals to a number of sectors , yet doesn?t compromise on quality . ?

cedia was a big hit for panasonic with the whole show talking about how amazing the 152 ?
