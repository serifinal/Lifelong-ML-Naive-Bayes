is it still advisable to `` run in '' a new plasma ? .
i was in the market for a budget 42 '' after good advice from this forum i took delivery of a txp42s30b very pleased with the set , i have read various threads regarding this but most seem to be a few years old , i prefer a brighter picture so should i wait a while before adjusting the settings to my preferred settings ?
