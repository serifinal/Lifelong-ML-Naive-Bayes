panasonic customer ( don " t ) care .
this is a copy of a letter i sent to panasonic after a recent telephone call to customer care , i think you should call yourselves " customer do n't care " .
the representative i spoke to had an attitude which bordered on rudeness .
as a result of this conversation , i will never purchase another panasonic product again and i will make my opinion heard to any others who may be contemplating a panasonic purchase .
i do n't care what anybody says , a $ 3,000 tv ( viera th - 50pz80a 50 " ( 127 cm ) full - hd digital plasma tv ) should n't need $ 500 spent on it after 18 months to keep it going .
that is a bad product , i agree that the normal warranty period has expired but to be told " you should have purchased the extended warranty " has only added insult to injury .
i will post copies of this letter all over the internet to serve as a warning to others as to what panasonic thinks is a fair life span of a top end product .
i do n't think anyone else will agree with panasonic " customer ( do n't ) care " .
i am 48 years old , and this is the worst purchase i have ever made to date.i would have expected my product replaced with a new one that is not defected or to be offered new parts ( main board ) from panasonic or at least sympathy .
