tv diy .
my 50 inch lg plasma has a red haze over whole screen , the picture is viewable but makes the tv unwatchable , its like the picture is dull / deadish there is also a constant buzzing sound when the tv is on .
i showed my tv to a repair guy and he said x and y boards need replacing.is this easy to do myself ?
i have made computers from components before , but no soldering
