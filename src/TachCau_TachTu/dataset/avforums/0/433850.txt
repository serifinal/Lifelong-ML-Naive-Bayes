ps50c6900 help .
hi all i am new to the forum so thanks for your future help !
i have a ps50c6900 that is 13 months old and tonihgt i have used the tv with no problems but then later it was turned on from standby and it would not recognise sky or freesat via hdmi cables ?
i have tried all 4 hdmi ports and different cables but no luck .
there is definately no issue with sky as the feed can be seen upstairs on other tvs .
the firmware is also upto date .
i can view videos via usb on a hard drive .
any ideas ?
i even tried connecting up via the avi and scart but this does not work .
internet tv options work fine .
will ring samsung tomorrow but as its 1 month out of the guarantee i will be very fustrated if i have to pay for repair , if it can be repaired at all !
has anyone had this problem or know of it ?
thanks for your help simon
