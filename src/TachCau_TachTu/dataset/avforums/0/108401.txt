panasonic green patches problem .
my tv has the green patches / tinge problem as described in : green tinge fault - panasonic ( vt30 , gt30 and st30 ) please post / vote on this thread to get an idea of how many people had or still have this problem .
if you sent back your tv before any of the milestones in the poll , add the details as a post .
if you have n't got this problem and are gutsy and also have an hd humax pvr , go into the epg and press the i button on one of the programmes , this will bring up a big white box with the programme details that really highlights the problem .
