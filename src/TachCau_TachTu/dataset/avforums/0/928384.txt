panasonic tx - p50vt30 ; screen offset problem ? .
hi all , today i installed my p50vt30 , first experiences on image quality are very positive .
although i have something strange , the image starts about 5 cm from the left of the effective part of the screen .
in the setup menu a part of the text is missing on the left side , i restorend to factory settings and went through all setup options but ca n't get it covered .
from a user point of view it looks like the first 5 cm ( horizontal ) of the screen are not used / active .
i tried all aspect ratio 's but since the menu ( from initial setup on ) also shows the same problem , i think it 's not the aspect ratio ( in all ratio 's the same around 5 cm are black / unused ) .
here are some pictures : http://www.sierracosworth.nl/img/tx-p50vt30/ does someone recognise this problem ?
