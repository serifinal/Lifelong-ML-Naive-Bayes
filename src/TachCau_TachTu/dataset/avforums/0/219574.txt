gt30 and divx via dlna .
i 've had a bit of a search on this but ca n't find anything that answers my question .
i have some divx avi 's on my computer and want to dlna them to my gt30 .
all the divx avi 's i have tried either flat out do n't work or are jumpy , grey and blocky and stop after 15/20 seconds .
by stop i mean the player acts as if it is playing but it is silent and blank screen .
i have tried a few different dlna servers on my pc ( win 7 ultimate 64 ) serviio , tversity , wmp , mezzmo .
all have exactly the same end results .
the avi 's work fine in vlc and wmp on my pc .
the tv and computer are connected via 200mb / s home plugs .
the tv will happily cope with 1080p with hd sound mkvs streamed in exactly the same way .
curiously after re-encoding one of the divx avi 's as an h. 264 mkv it works perfectly on the tv .
has anyone got any help at all they could offer , experience , words of advice ?
i do n't want to have to re-encode my whole library ( 160 gb over 700 files ) just so i can have the option of watching it all on my tv ... cheers .
