panasonic hdmi2 .
sorry guys , i have read through the different threads on here about this , with no clear answer , this is my problem .
i got new st30 plasma , and have it connected on hdmi2 ( tv ) for arc to my onkyo 609avr , as thats the arc channel , but whenever i turn my tv on , i have to rummage around to find the tv remote so as i can switch to hdmi 2 , to get sky , blueray & ps3 , this is a really annoying issue , as the wife and kids phone me ( how do get this tv to work ) .
so in short is there a setting that whenever you turn the tv on from a standing start , it automatically defaults to hdmi 2 , then you just turn on whatever source you want eg sky etc. .
set up , onkyo 609 avr panasonic 50 " st30 sky hd ps3 panasonic bdp210 kef 3005se , and a big pile of wires
