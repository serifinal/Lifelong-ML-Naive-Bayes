pv500 problem poll .
yes , another pv500 thread .
i want to put the pv500 problems into context .
i would like to know if you have seen any of the problems with the pv500 and how much it affects your viewing .
this thread is not for moaning about too many pv500 threads , it is a serious thread for owners / potential buyers to see how widespread the problems are , and to see if they are of any concern .
i will be showing what results you have posted so only pv500 owners vote please .
if you can tell me : what size screen you have do you notice the contrast change regularly is there a buzzing that is audiable at low volumes do you have the split screen / horizonal line in the centre of the screen you can check more that one box to see who voted what , click on the number by the results normal viewing is when you are just watching the tv / dvd , not when you are specifically looking for the defects eg. .
universal logo ( contrast change ) .
if you can also make a comment once you have voted , thanks some other problems threads to read : pv500 problem thread discovered slight problem with pv500 thread horizontal line problem
