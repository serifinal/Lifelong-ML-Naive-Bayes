black bar 's above and below picture .
can anyone tell me how to get rid of these please ?
i have a thomson wysiu 42 " plasma connected up to a desktop pc via a vga plug , the graphics card is a geforce 4 ti4200 , some video is full screen and some has these black bars , such as when viewing widescreen dvd 's , the aspect ratio on the tv is set to 16x9 , i put a promo dvd in which says 4x3 and it 's full screen , some youtube is full screen , but the majority has the black bars .
the desktop on boot up is full screen .
is there anyway round this or do i have to live with ?
tia
