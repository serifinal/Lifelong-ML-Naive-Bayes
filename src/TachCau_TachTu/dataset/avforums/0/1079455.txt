panasonic th50px70 hd problems .
i have had the above tv for a few years and always said to friends that i could n't tell the difference between hd and sd channels , which everyone laughed at .
however , when friends came round to watch the fight saturday night they all agreed with me .
i have read a lot of reviews on the tv and it is from what ive read considered relatively good for its age so i was wondering if anyone else has this tv and had the same problem and have been able to sort it .
or if anyone can suggest something i can try .
any help would be much appreciated .
