panasonic th - 42ph9 .
we have a panasonic th - 42ph9 screen / monitor which we use for watching dvd 's & linking to a laptop - we have it linked to our home theatre amplifier .
we have the following boards : ty - fb9bd in slot 1 ; ty - fb8hm in slot 2 ; not sure of the number for the board in slot 4 - it has pc in ( female 15 pin ) + audio , plus serial ( female 9 pin ) - see attached photos .
[ slot 3 is empty ] we would like to add a tv receiver but we 're not sure which board to purchase - that 's if they 're still available !
any idea 's or can anyone help ?
