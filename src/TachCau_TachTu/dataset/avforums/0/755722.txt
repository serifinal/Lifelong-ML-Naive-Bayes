panasonic g20 ?
persistent channel logo .
hello , i have a panasonic g20 .
after watching movies on a tv channel for an entire afternoon , the logo now appears almost permanently ?
it?s especially visible with gray gradients .
in order to get rid of it , i played the toy story blu-ray more than twenty times .
i also ran the famous white scrolling bar for more than twenty hours .
unfortunately , the channel logo is still there ?
actually , i haven?t noticed any difference between before and after my attempts .
is there anything i can do ?
thanks !
