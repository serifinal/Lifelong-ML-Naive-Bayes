panny problems ... .
hi everyone , i 'm having trouble with my 4 year old panasonic px37 tv .
about 5 minutes after i switch it on , the picture flashes then goes dark if i wait about 5 mins then switch it on again the same thing happens .
i have n't contacted anyone yet - i will try the shop tomorrow ( but , i reckon they 'll wash their hands . ) .
has anyone here had any luck with the warranty which panasonic gave away with these sets ?
if so , did you have to pay much towards repairs , and was it even worth it ? .
