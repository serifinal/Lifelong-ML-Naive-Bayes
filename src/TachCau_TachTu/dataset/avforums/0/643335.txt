set up issues .
hi guys , could someone give me some advice here , i have a panny st 30 , i set it up with the hdmi coming from port 1 on the tv , to the input / output on my onkyo 609 , and everything seemed to work , blueray ps3 , sky etc , but then i was not getting the arc of the tv for the smart tv functions , i looked on here and found out that the arc is on hdmi 2 port on the pannys , so off the wall came the tv and plugged ithe hdmi in to port 2 , well done tv back on wall , now i have to use the tv remote to manually switch it to hdmi 2 , then i get sky , but no ps3 , no blueray , just big blue screens .
so my question is do you have to run 2 hdmi cables from the tv , one from port 1 on the telly to the amp to get my other functions , and then another one from port 2 on the telly to the amp to gain the arc , or have i wired it up wrong , can you please advise .
thanks guys ps , this is doing my head in so any advise is welcome , as my wife thinks im daft , of the wal , l on the wall , and so on , cheers
