no stereo output for lg 42 pj350 .
hi , i have recently purchased lg 42pj350 .
i have connected it to my computer for video vga cable , for audio pc sound input port of tv .
further i have connected my edifier 2.1 speakers to audio out port of tv .
so the sound from my pc goes to the tv and then from tv it is routed to edifier 2.1 speakers .
it is observed that when edifier 2.1 speakers connected directly to pc it works as stereo ( tested from realtek hd manager ) , however when its connected to the tv audioout port of tv via rca cables the sound comes out is only mono and without punch .
there is no option in tv set to change the sound from mono to stereo .
can anyone help ?
