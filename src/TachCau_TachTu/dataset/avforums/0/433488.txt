i have the 50 inch samsung ps50c450 i havent come across any problems untill i tried to configure the tv to work with the xbox 360 , now its to dark i went to full brightness n its still not the same as it should be , i have tried numerous settings but none with a clean proper picture , im using my hdmi cable i bought gold plated so its not that but if any one knows of anythin to help me it would be great i only started messin round with it because it kept droppin the picture during game play .
i tried ffactory reset and started again but im right back where i started .
