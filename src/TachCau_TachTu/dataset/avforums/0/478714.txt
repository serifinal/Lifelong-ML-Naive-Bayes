panasonic th50pf20 fault - flashing lines .
it looks like my 18 month old pf20 has developed a fault .
i noticed it a couple of weeks ago when my onkyo tx - nr807 was returned after having a new hdmi board as the ethernet board was playing up .
on first inspection i thought it was the new board was at fault , but after more diagnostics , it appears that its the pdp i 've uploaded a video of the problem , namely flashing horizontal lines appearing vertically on the right hand side of the screen .
any ideas on what the cause is before i call av sales on monday ?
