ps51d550 " screen fit " or " 16:9 " .
hi guys , i have the samsung ps51d550 51 " 3d pdp and was wondering what is the correct screen setting .
when i say correct , i mean without having to " strech " or " shrink " the original movie source .
or should i say sacrifice the quality of the encoding .
i have noticed that with " screen fit " the image is slightly narrower than when using the " 16:9 " .
this case applies to both , original bluray source and encoded mkv .
could someone please explain the difference to me and what the correct settings should be ?
thanks tomas
