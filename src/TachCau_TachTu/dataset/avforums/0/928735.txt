panasonic gt30 probs .
hi guys new tv arrived ( panasonic gt30 ) today , noticed on a few channels we are getting small square pixaling on the top right of the screen , and on outer edges very faint lines which seems to come and go , any ideas , also noticed when i switch on the virgin v + box it comes up with 1080i / 50hz input i thought the tv was a 600hz
