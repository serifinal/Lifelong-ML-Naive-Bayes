ps3 + panasonic tx - p50g20b what are best settings ? .
hi guys , i 've been some searching in this forum and some infomration on the web , i 'm trying to get the best settings for my tv to get the best playback for blu rays from my ps3 .
currently i have pretty much every ' advanced ' feature on my tv disabled ... including : p - nr - off cats - off vivid colour - off 24p smooth film - off ( if this is on , it produces artifacts on the screen ) 16:9 overscan - off ( only turn this on for various dodgy dvd 's with weird stuff round the edge of the picture ) resolution enhancer - max it just seems that in some blu rays i can see the ' refresh ' of the screen , like jagged tears appearing .
i must say it is more noticible on other blu rays same some ... also , if i try a software update i get ' communication with the server failed ' any ideas or suggestions , happy to test what i can !
thanks
