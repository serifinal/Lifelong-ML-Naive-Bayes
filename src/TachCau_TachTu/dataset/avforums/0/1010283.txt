plasmas above radiators of fireplaces .
okay i 'll throw this question out there .
should plasmas be mounted above radiators or above fireplaces .
in a lot of the promotional material you see the happy couple sitting by a roaring fire with a plasma ( usually switched off ) mounted on the chimney flu .
i 'm currently working out the best place to mount my plasma and there are two options .
1 is above a 1m double rad and the other other is on a bare wall .
my gut feal tell me mounting it above the rad is a bad idea ?
