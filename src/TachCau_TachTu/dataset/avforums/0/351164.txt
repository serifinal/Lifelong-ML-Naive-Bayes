panasonic plasma fault .
my panasonic th-37px60b has served me fine until tonight .
there was a popping noise and now only the left half of the screen is working .
then there 's a thin , incomplete vertical green line , the third quarter solid black , right hand quarter solid white .
is this a major fault ?
not worth replacing ?
it was purchased from ask in london in december 2006 and i did n't take out any extended warranty .
any advice would be much appreciated .
