panasonic th42pz81 colour swap ? .
i have acquired a panasonic th42pz81 and am quite pleased with it but one small gremlin in the works is bugging me .
the tv is plugged into a sony rht - g900 [ all in one stand / sound system ] which has a ps3 and xbox 360 plugged into it & everything is connected via hdmi .
occasionally when i switch to hdmi1 which is the channel the stand is on & power on the ps3 or xbox the colours of red and blue are swapped .
simply turning either console off then on again solves it but i was wondering if anyone has ever come across this and knows of a solution ?
