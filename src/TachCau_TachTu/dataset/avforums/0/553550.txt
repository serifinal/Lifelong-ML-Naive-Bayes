panasonic st30 problems - fuzzy / grainy images . .
hi guys .
i received my 50 " st30 a few days ago from amazon .
despite hearing a lot of negative comments on its design i 'm actually digging its looks .
so , hooked it up to my panny 3d bd - player and watched a few episodes of lost and then sherlock holmes on bluray of course .
this is my first plasma , having previously only used lcd tvs since the blu ' revolution .
i was extremely disappointed with one aspect of the picture .
now i knew that this would not be as bright as my last tv ( 3d samsung lcd ) but brightness is n't the issue .
i am using cinema mode and daytime scenes on lost and sherlock holmes were beautiful and i only expect them to get better as the set gets properly broken in .
however dark scenes , specifically night scenes shot outside are a terrible mess .
multiple scenes in the second season of lost before locke enters the hatch in the dark jungle were just abysmal to watch .
the only way i can describe it was that there was a sort of fuzz over the dark scenes , like white dots .
almost like what you would see if you put your face right up close to the screen .
when i switched the lights on it became less noticeable but i watch my blus ' in a dark room and will continue to do so .
i 'm getting pretty worried about the picture in this respect and i 'm beginning to regret selling my 3d samsung le40c750 - which although being 10 " smaller and older produced an absolutely stunning picture .
now i know lcd and plasma are two different beasts but night / dark scenes on the sammy were a joy to behold - so crisp and clear .
on the panny - an absolute mess .
even my technophobe grandmother could notice the blurry fuzz !
shame , because everything else i 've bought from panny has been absolutely fantastic and have lasted years and years .
maybe i just got a bad set . .
can anyone please help me out because i really need to figure out whether or not to return this pretty soon .
thanks .
