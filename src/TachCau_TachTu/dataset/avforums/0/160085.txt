problem with d8000 internal tuner ( applies to both led and plasma ) finally solved !! .
hello i 've noticed that i 'm not alone about using the samsung d8000 's internal tuners , either for terrestrial , cable or satellite .
there are at least two issues i 'm aware of , and they are fixable by a service technician .
problem 1 : randomly , picture may break up ( sometimes as often as 1 - 2 times a minute , other times as rare as 15 minutes between every time ) .
this seems to be the case for both dvb - t , dvb - c and dvb - s as long as there is a ca - module inserted into the ci - slot .
problem 2 : not sure how wide spread this one is , but the dvb - s tuner is picking up so much noise that the picture breaks up all the time , particularly on lower frequencies and hd broadcasts are particularly bad .
this is regardless of whether or not a ca - module is inserted .
fix for problem 1 : seems to be no other fix than a replacement of the mainboard ( the tuners is a part of that board and can not be changed individually ) fix for problem 2 : a service technician adds a capacitor to the main board , causing noise / spikes to be filtered out .
if you also suffer from the first problem ( hard to tell unless you 've tried this fix first ) the mainboard also needs replacing .
i 've now had the board changed on mine , and also applied the noise fix for dvb - s. issues with the satellite tuner is now fully gone .
kinda strange , though , but the signal meter still shows low signal quality and lots of bit errors , but seeing how this works flawlessly now i suspect that signal meter to not function correctly .
in the end , what matters is what you get on screen , not what those meters are saying .
anyway , just thought i 'd post this since there was finally a resolution to a problem that some are having and not knowing why .
hope this can be of help to whomever suffers from either of the two defects above .
