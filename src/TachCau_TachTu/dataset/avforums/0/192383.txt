panasonic 50 " plasma design issue .
we have a panasonic 50 " 3d plasma th - p50st30z tv and a panasonic 3d blu - ray home theater sc - btt755 .
they work apart from one silly problem .
i would expect it to be normal to place the front centre speaker centrally below , and close to , the tv screen .
our centre speaker is one of those wide low types , but with this tv , the speaker height obscures the tv remote control sensor , and also seems to stop the3d glasses from working .
the glasses have an ir sensor so i assume there is an ir transmitter in the tv also being obscured by the centre speaker .
to fix this , the tv pedestal will need attention to raise the screen by a small amount so the remote will work with the speaker in its normal position .
should n't really have to do that , but i ca n't see any other way to solve the problem .
