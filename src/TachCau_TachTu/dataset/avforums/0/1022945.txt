damaged screen on panny 50 " g20 - help ! .
dear all my darling daughter has damaged the screen on my father - in - laws 50 " panasonic g20 .
she has managed to put a few deep scratches across the length of the screen .
he is not keen to claim on his house insurance , as it will affect his premium .
does anyone know the cost of a new screen , or are you best getting a new tv ?
i feel really awful , and must get it fixed or replaced with a like - for - like .
still feeling numb from the whole event - kids , eh ?
