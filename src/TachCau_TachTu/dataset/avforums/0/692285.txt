faults with panasonic g10 ordered from marks & spencer in late 2009 .
hi , i bought a panasonic g10 plasma from marks and spencers with a 5 year guarantee .
the faults are mll black level rises and image retention for still images left on for short periods of time like 30 seconds .
i understand from reading the threads that the problem still happens after a engineer fix .
so because of this i would like a refund or exchange .
is it easier to get a refund / exhange through panasonic or the retailer ?
is there a template letter i can use in my email or post ?
whats the correct procedure to get this situation resolved ?
thanks ,
