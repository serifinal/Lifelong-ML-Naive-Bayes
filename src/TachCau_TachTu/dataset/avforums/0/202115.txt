panny th - 42pz80 : default to hdmi on switch on ? .
hi , i know that on this and similar panny plasmas , you have a menu option to default to internal " tv " tuner or " av " inputs when switching on , but there seems to be no option to default to any of the hdmi inputs .
no idea why there is this discrimination between analogue and digital external sources .
as i 'm running a panny hdd / dvd over hdmi as my main source , this is extremely annoying .
i can cope with it - a single press of the " av " button on the remote will bring up the right hdmi input - but that one extra button press may be too much for my kids to remember and may incur the wrath of the technophobic wife .
i 'm also daisychaining a sky box through it , so it 's not as relying on the viera link to autoswitch as soon as i hit " play " on the hdd / dvd recorder is going to be enough .
anyone able to help ?
is it just not possible to default to a specific hdmi input , or even switch off the internal tuner so the tv ignores it as an input ?
