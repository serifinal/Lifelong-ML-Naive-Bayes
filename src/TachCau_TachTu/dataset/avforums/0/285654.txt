panny plasma dithering ruining the experience .
hey , i recently bought the panny plasma tx - p42s20b after returning an led ( 37le7900 ) which had terrible black levels and poor viewing angle .
i certainly haven?t been dissapointed in that regard but there is something that is bothering me , ?
dithering ? .
up close ( less than a foot ) it looks like analogue snow .
the problem is from 5 foot ( normal viewing distance for 42 &#8243; ) i can still notice it pretty heavily making even the ps3 menu and tv menu look really grainy .
this inherent grain definitely exacerbates the natural grain of blu ray movies , making a double layer of grain .
for example ?
when i pause a blu ray the blurays natural grain freezes then i can see the tvs natural dither underneath .
i know this because i?ve watched all my blu rays on both tvs and although the black levels really enhance viewing pleasure on the plasma the extra grain certainly does not ?
it has become very distracting .
is it normal to see dithering at 5 feet , with 20/20 vision ?
sitting even further back helps a bit but then i lose the hd detail .
i didn?t buy a 1080p to sit at the other end of the room .
your advice is much appreciated .
