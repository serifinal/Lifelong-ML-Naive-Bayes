panasonic tx - p50u30b problem .
hi i recently bought a panasonic tx - p50u30b plasma to replace my aged samsung hd45 dlp which stopped working when the bun went .
initially i was fairly happy with the panasonic not blown away but for the money felt it was reasonable for the money .
but a week one i just cant get the settings work for a picture that im happy with .
sometimes the picture is good and other times the colours seem either too full on and the picture dim or the other way round .
this may well just be source and not the tvs fault but im getting fed up with constantly fiddling with the settings to get a picture i happy with .
also ive started to notice changes in the brightness whilst watching a program where it quite noticably changes brightness .
has anyone got any experience of this tv or suggest the best settings or can advise whether the brightness change may be a proccesing fault .
thanks .
