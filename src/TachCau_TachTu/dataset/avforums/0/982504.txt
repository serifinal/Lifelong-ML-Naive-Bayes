vt30 buzzing noise on 55 inch model .
hi the buzzing noise is louder on my 55 inch vt30 compared to my 42 inch pz800 plasma which i can only hear when i?m standing next to the pz800 when the tv volume is low on the vt30 i can hear the buzzing noise from where i?m sitting about 10 feet away ?
i can also hear the buzzing noise level going up and down sometimes on the vt30 ?
appreciate any comments !
thanks
