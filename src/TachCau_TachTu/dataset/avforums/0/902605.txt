pioneer kuro krp500 without mediacenter krp - m01 .
i 've a ( new ) krp500a without mediacenter krp - m01 .
now was i wondering if you could use the displayportconnection of the tv with the atlona converter wich can convert a hdmi signal to a mini displayport signal .
it 's capable at 1080p .
it 's developed for a hdmi signal ( ps3 , bd , dvd ) on a macscreen wich only has a minidisplayport .
has someone experience in this matter ?
i think the technology of the tv is inside the tv and not in de mediacenter ( for example the krp500m and the fact that the ir - eye of the remote controller is located in the tv and not in the mediacenter ) .
