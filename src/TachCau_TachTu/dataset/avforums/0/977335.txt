samsung plasma ps-42s5h problem : black screen .
hi all , i am new to this forum and this is my first post .
i finally late last year got my home theater system ready .
i got the loudspeakers i want .
however now i have encountered problem with my 3 year old tv .
i have samsung plasma tv -lrb- 42 '' -rrb- .
occasionally but several times every day , the screen has started to go black except one horizontal colour line -lrb- maybe 4 millileter high -rrb- somewhere in the screen .
does anyone happen to know and help me with this i.e. what could cause this ?
br , mtt
