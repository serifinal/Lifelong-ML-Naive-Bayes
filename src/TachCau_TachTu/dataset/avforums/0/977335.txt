samsung plasma ps - 42s5h problem : black screen .
hi all , i am new to this forum and this is my first post .
i finally late last year got my home theater system ready .
i got the loudspeakers i want .
however now i have encountered problem with my 3 year old tv .
i have samsung plasma tv ( 42 " ) .
occasionally but several times every day , the screen has started to go black except one horizontal colour line ( maybe 4 millileter high ) somewhere in the screen .
does anyone happen to know and help me with this i.e. what could cause this ?
br , mtt
