do john lewis do home repairs ?
( panny just broke - what could be wrong ? ) .
great christmas day for me today - switched my panny on this evening , flicked over to an hdmi input ready for my xbox and hear a small " pop " .
tv switched to hdmi one and i have a black bar about 3 inches wide to the left of the screen .
it seems as though one vertical 3 inch wide section of the screen has just stopped working obviously i 'm stuck now and ca n't call jl until wed i guess .
i 've tried leaving the set off for a while as i clutch as straws hoping that it might reset itself ( fat chance ) but did n't help .
as it is a 50inch model ( th50pz80b ) i 'm hoping they can repair it here rather than take it away ( and make the wait for it to be fixed even longer ) - is that what they tend to do ?
( if it 's a known easy fix ? )
as it all seems to be functioning other than this black bar i 'm hoping it is something relatively minor .
i 'm so gutted .
i love this tv and the thought of someone opening her up , and potentially ( accidentally ) putting finger marks in the screen fills me with dread thanks for any info p.s it was bought in aug 2008 so is under their 5 year warranty so do n't want to do anything drastic myself like remove the back panel to look for faults if i can avoid it .
even though i used to work in car hi - fi doing installations and repairs and so am confident with dismantling electronics , i 'd rather avoid it unless it may be an easy fix .
