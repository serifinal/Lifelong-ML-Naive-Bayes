panasonic tx-p50s30b .
hi guys , i 've had this set about a week now , and whilst i 'm well impressed with it , i 'm still adjusting the picture quite a bit .
i 've noticed that in various room lightness , the picture seems to look different for example , if we have the room quite dark with one light on , the best setting seems to be `` cinema '' , whereby if we have the main light on , it looks better on `` normal '' .
if we have it set to `` normal '' in a dark room , there appears to be a very slight grey tinge to the picture , which goes when we change it to cinema .
the other thing is i ca n't see to get the balance just right with the contrast and brightness .
can i ask similar tv owners , how do you have your 's set ?
thanks !
