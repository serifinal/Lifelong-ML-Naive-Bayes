panasonic p50g10b flickering over hdmi .
anyone got an idea what this problem is ?
youtube - & #x202a ; panny p50g10b flickering fault & #x202c ; & rlm ; the tv is fed over hdmi from a home theatre pc which runs w7mc .
the sound is constant as the sound is output to the 2.1 system from the pc .
i 'm not touching the remote or fiddling with any sources it just does this randomly , i thought it was the a board , the tv guy does n't think so as it wo n't do it with their br player or on freeview .
it 's been at the tv repair agent , they say they ca n't recreate the fault but the loan set they left does n't display the fault which leads me to believe my htpc is ok .
