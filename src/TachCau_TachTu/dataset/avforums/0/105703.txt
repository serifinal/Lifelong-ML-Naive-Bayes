lg 50pv350 htpc / receiver connection problem .
hello , i got my lg 50pv350 tv today , so far so good .
i wanted to connect my asrock htpc viac yamaha rx - v1065 receiver ( all hdmi ) as i did with my ex 's lg 50pk350 .
however : - while htpc is connected directly to tv everything works fine - after connecting the receiver to tv the receiver menu is visible on tv ( receiver - tv connection work fine on any resolution ) - after i connect the htpc to receiver and switch it to any of hdmi ports the htpc is currently on , the tv loses the signal .
receiver shows the htpc is connected to hdmi port and tv shows the tv hdmi port is live ( not grayed ) , however , " no signal " .
i am even able to play music on the receiver from htpc and at the same time see the receiver menu on tv or , " lost signal " when trying to show the htpc desktop .
- after i swich the resolution to 1280x720 ( using samsung monitor conneced to vga port ) , the tv shows the htpc screen .
switching to full hd results is " no signal " - even boot screen in text mode is not working in " via receiver " config - if i exchange the tv with my samsung 24 " monitor , the whole connection starts working as it is supposed to , - exchanging the cables and its ends does not result in any change , it 's deterministic , i can tell which setting works and which not , - this never happened with my ex 's 50pk350 ( the same devices , even the same cables ) , i did n't notice any problem also with samsung p50c6500 plasma ( except for buzzing - > returned ) .
the tv manual says " use the high speed hdmi cables " , however i do n't believe the cables causes the trouble ( one is bandridge looks like not 100 % connections all the time but works ok when plugged correctly , the second one is some noname with no apparent issues ) .
anyone having the similar experience ?
one of the solution is returning the tv and going for pk350 ( still available ) , however , i 'd appreciate avoiding this exercise ... thanks for help .
