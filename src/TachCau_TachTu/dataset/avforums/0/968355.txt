panasonic viera px - t42g20b switches off and back on ... .
hello everybody .
i have had this telly for almost 6 months now and luckilly we have got 5 years warranty on it .
the problem we are having , which started today , is that the telly switches off and back on on its own .
after unpluging the power and giving it a couple of minutes off the problem still existes .
i have read here that it was due to a signal boost on the freeview so as recomended unpluged the aerial cable and still happened once to this moment .
anybody has had this problem and what was the solution ?
cheers .
albert
