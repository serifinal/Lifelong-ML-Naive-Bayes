vt30 faint vertical lines .
seeking advice \ opinion \ experience of viewing programmes , i.e. football , where the camera pans quickly and faint vertical lines become visible .
i 've had two vt30 50 '' replaced because of this issue , and i 'm still not satisfied .
to my eyes the problem is with the panel , since picture setting changes make no difference .
is this a general problem affecting all vt30s ?
