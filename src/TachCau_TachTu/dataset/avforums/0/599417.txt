panasonic vt range stock availablility and display locations .
there is much interest in these sets at the moment -lrb- rightly or wrongly -rrb- , and it appears that the vt range from panasonic is going to be hard to come by for the next month -lrb- or two -rrb- , as they slowly make their way to the uk , and thus i thought i would start this thread so that people can be aware of where they can see the screens , and which retailers have stock .
