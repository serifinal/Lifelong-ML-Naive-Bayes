lg pv450 & ps3 question .
so , i have a new lg tv as listed in title and a ps3 i noticed when i watch a blu ray or dvd via ps3 ( and monster hdmi ) , and i press enter on the lg remote , it says 1080i and not 1080p ??? why is this and how to i get the 1080p picture ..... ?
kind of confused as i assumed all blu rays played 1080p ??? it also says 1080i when watching hd satellite ( but that is hooked up via monster component cables )
