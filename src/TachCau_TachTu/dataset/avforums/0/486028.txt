panasonic tx - p42v20 dvd quality .
to all you 42v20 owners out there who use their ps3 to upscale to 1080p , what is the quality of the picture like from dvd ??? i am far from impressed with the picture it displays .
i am using the thx setting that i use for blu ray , and it just seems blurry , i can honestly say my 4 yr old 37px70 is far better with dvd 's than this .
even the titles / words when you load the dvd 's seem that bit blurry .
has anyone tried the star wars films , the first 3 films ??? i saw quite a few jagged line here and there throughout ep .2 , and again overall not blown away by the pic .
surely it should be excellent with upscaled dvd 's .
helpp !!!!!!!
