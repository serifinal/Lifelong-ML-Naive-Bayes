lx5090 - cheesed off .
splashed out # 3200 3 years ago on an lx5090 , been mildly impressed with picture quality during that time .
my father in law has purchased a # 600 samsung and the pq is a million times better than mine - it 's awesome , super sharp .
seriously ****** off man , what the hell is all that about ??
some of you will no doubt say that it 's imperative to get it isf 'd but , why ?
as if paying out over # 3k on a tv is not enough , i have to spend a further # 300 on making it look as good as a # 600 set .
not happy man .
waste of money , case in point .
rant over .
