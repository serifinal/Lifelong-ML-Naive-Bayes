panasonic 42c3 3 vs 0 me .
good day , i heard about this forum from a friend and hopefully you guys will be able to provide me some help , because i almost went mental this weekend .
i just bought a panasonic 42c3 plasma tv and when i tried to connect it to my pc it did not work .
i bought a minihdmi - hdmi adapter , hdmi cable .
basically everything i need to get the job done .
when i try to connect to it with my pc it will not find it .
i should specify that the video card i am trying to connect the plasma is an asus nvidia gtx470 , and the operating system is windows 7 on 64 bit .
hopefully you can help me out of this jam .
thank you for your time .
