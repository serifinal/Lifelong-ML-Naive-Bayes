panasonic p42gt30b pc desktop resize .
i 've just received my 42gt30b andi 'm more than happy with the picture out of the box - but i do have a problem .
i currently connect everything to my receiver via hdmi ( currently a yamaha rx - v1065 with changing to an onkyo 609 ) , and then output to a splitter so i can send the output to my panasonic ae3000 projector and now my panasonic 42gt30b .
the issue i have is if i set the pc to output 1080p24hz the desktop on the pc is too big when displayed on the tv .
i could resize it on the pc , but then the picture when displayed on the projector would be wrong .
i previously owned a panasonic ph8d panel and you could resize the tv picture from the remote .
is there any way to resize the picture size on the tv ???
