lg 60pz550 screen size adjustment ? .
hello : i have recently purchased the lg 60pz550tv ... it is great , but i have one small problem ... the screen cuts off just the smallest bit of picture on the sides and top ... not much at all , but enough to cut off , say , a letter or two of a title or headline ... is there a way to adjust this ?
i have looked through the manual -lrb- really -rrb- and have n't found the answer ... thanks a lot , steve
