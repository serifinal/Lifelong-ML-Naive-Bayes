panasonic 50vt30b fan noise .
hi all , i wanted to get a feel for owners of the vt30b and whether or not they are noticing the sound of the fans at the rear of the set .
my environment at home is very quiet with a lot of hard surfaces and i can clearly hear the sound of the fans when either the set is on mute or when the volume in a particular scene drops .
at first this was n't an issue but now that i have latched on to it i find myself listening out for it and it is becoming a nuisance .
my questions to the group are : 1 ) do you hear the fans ?
2 ) given that my set is only 10 days old it is possible to ask for an exchange ?
thanks ,
