panasonic txp50s20b audio problem .
hi folks , need a bit of advice ... have recently bought as panasonic txp50s20b ... very happy with the picture . .
outstanding through sky,blu-ray and even freeview but the audio is causing some concern .
dont have a stand alone av set up at the moment so am currently limited to the onboard sound . .
which i am having major issues with basically can not hear speech without having to crank up the volume to such a level that the effects overpower the room .
this is especially true with blu-ray and sky have tried different leads and settings and even had a panasonic engineer out who , though acknowledged the problem , stated that the machine was operating within factory specs , , therefore no problem ... does this ring a bell with anyone else many thanks in advance
