new owner query re : tx - p50vt30b and thx .
i have today taken possession of a tx - p50vt30b and have a query , regarding viewing modes .
i have had the tv viewing mode set up as ' normal ' , but seem to have read that some people are using thx as it gives a more accurate colour .
i am not a ' techie ' and just want to know what is the ' best ' viewing mode for someone like myself , who is just starting to use plasma technology , and knows little about it .
when i mentioned thx to the engineer , he said that his older panasonic had experienced problems in this mode , so he did not use it .
he did agree that there did not seem to be any problems on mine , but still left it on normal .
any suggestions / recommendations ?
