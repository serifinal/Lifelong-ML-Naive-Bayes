panasonic 2011 brightness fluctuation ( test clip ) .
fluctuating brightness test clip here 's an mkv test clip 10.87 m .
during the scene a ' europa ' logo is shown .
the picture is slowing gaining brightness ( intentionally ) , but it then ( just before lady appears ) brightens up by an obviously unatural jump .
- home .2009 .
fbr.test.mkv - gigasize.com : host and share your files if i watch the above clip ( on a gt30 ) in full screen / auto , i get the brightness jump .
if i watch it in 4:3 ( with grey sidebars ) , i do n't ... if people let me know if this does indeed demonstrate the problem on their sets , then we have at least one clip to demonstrate / reproduce the problem !
from feedback thusfar it does seem that gt30 sets not coming with fw1213 show fluctuating brightness , whereas ones coming with fw1213 do not .
any tests people can perform ( with the above test ) to prove / disprove this would be useful .
ps : the previous fluctuation thread seems to have been closed due to some posting issues .
let 's keep this one clean folks !
