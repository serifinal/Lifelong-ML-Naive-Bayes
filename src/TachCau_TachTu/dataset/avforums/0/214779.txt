will a panny gt30 + bluray player replace my media centre .
hi all , and merry xmas , i 'm tempted to spoil myself with the sales with a panasonic gt30 ( 50 " ) .
right now i have a samsung lcd and tv source / network mkv playback is a win7 media centre running media portal .
i use a ps3 for bluray playback .
audio is handled by a sony dts amp from the htpc via spdif .
i always went for a full - on htpc to get away from the typical playback issues you got from embedded equipment .
i 'm wondering if a gt30 will be a good replacement for my htpc with regards to avi / mkv playback ( from a network smb share or dnla server ) as well as handling my dvbs2 recording ?
i 'm also wondering which panny bluray player would be the best match based on my requirements above , eg the 210 ?
or should i go for the combo bluray hdd recorder ?
i do nt want to duplicate features already on the tv unless necessary .
also tempted to go the whole panny hog and get the soundbar too !
any thoughts welcomed , before i go burn some cash many thanks in advance
