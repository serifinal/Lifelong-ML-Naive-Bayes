vt30 - stupid question about powering tv .
guys , this is gon na sound pretty stupid but i 'm dumb and need to ask !
...... .
as an owner of this tv , you 'll know it has a power on / off button on the front of the set .
since i purchased this set last week , after powering it on for the first time i 've been turning it off via the standby button on the remote then turning it completely off at the mains as opposed to actually switching it off on the actual set .
is that ok or should i really be switching it off on the tv before switching the mains off !!?!! i 'm sure it does n't matter either way but i wanted to be sure for certain !!
cheers .
