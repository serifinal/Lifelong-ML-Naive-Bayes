no picture on panasonic 50 " plasma .
after having no 50 " tv for six weeks because the panel was dead , dreading the thought of leaving myself wide open to the local plasma repair people , who wanted £ 60 to even register and decide if there was a fault . .
i decided to ring panasonic themselves ... i spoke with ashley and explained the problem .
the fact that i had had the tv for over 4 years , though it had only maybe functioned for less than 800 hours ... the fact that i had accepted i may have to pay between £ 100 and £ 500 for the repair and that i was hoping for some advice with regard to burnt out boards , fuses or drivers ... in the most humble polite voice , i told him that my telly was broke and that i needed advice , even though it was well out the gaurentee . .
there was nothing on the forums regarding no screen , i had scoured the net for possibly 16 - 20 hours and nothing . .
i 'd even phoned the folks who i 'd found off the net , offering allsorts of vey costly assessments ... however , at panasonic , ashley said . . "
hold the number 1 key down for about 5 seconds ... " my telly worked !!!! why is this not included in the troubleshooting section of the operator 's manual !!!!!??? there 's also bugger all on the forums i 'd googled ... .
anyway , i hope this helps . .
i 'm still smiling and thinking that ashley and panasonic have once against proved they are on top of the job .
thanks . . . .
and , hold the number 1 key down if your panel goes dead !!
