lg 42pj650 cracked glass .
hi everyone , i 'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but basically i need some help .
i bought a lg 42pj650 tv off ebay about a month a go , it was going cheap because it had a small crack in the front glass panel .
however the crack grew bigger and it turns out there were more as well that grew bigger .
does anyone know of anywhere that i can find a replacement outer shell - including glass front , it does nt matter about price really , and i am happy to fit it myself so i just need the case .
any advice on this would be appreciated , thanks , james
