green dithering pixels on my screen - samsung plasma .
hi peeps , i have the samsung c680 plasma and have noticed that when my brightness is at 70 i get green dithering circular flicks on the black bars top and bottom of picture !
... it also happens on the picture itself .
when i turn it from 64 to 63 they dissapear , i was trying to get a good contrast / brightness balance as i keep loosing shadow detail .
anyway , is this problem normal or is my set faulty ?
thanks .
