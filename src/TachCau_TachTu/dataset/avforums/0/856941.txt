pioneer pdp -435-xde freeview / memory issue .
hi guys - and gals ... i have a pioneer pdp - 435xde since it first came out and overall been pleased with it .
however a few weeks ago i turned on the plasma and a message on screen invited me to set the time / date .
i selected cancel to get rid of that message and then there was no dtv at all available .
i could not get even to tune the digital tv ( menu item greyed out ) - i did however have analogue available .
pressing between dtv and analogue etc. .
i switched the whole system off and powered up again .
this time i still given the option to enter time / date and did so .
i could then get into the dtv set up and succesfully tuned freeview etc. .
this happened two times two days apart and am worried it is going to get worse .
like i say it 's been about two weeks since it last did this .
the tv is turned off completely in the evening .
could this just be an internal memory battery losing power ??
any advice would be gratefully received before i take the media receiver apart .
regards , graeme .
