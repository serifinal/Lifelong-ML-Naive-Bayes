hitachi 42pd5200 e plasma daughterboard issue . .
have acquired a dead hitachi 42pd5200 .
from what i 've read on here it seems to have similar probs to the 42pd7200 .
i 've been informed that the 42pd5200 has a " daughter - board " and this daughter - board has 2 smd transistors that need checking before r003 / r005 are replaced , otherwise they 're likely to blow again .
so , my question is . .
: which board is the daughter - board and does anyone know the location of the transistors ?
or ... have i been given the wrong info and the 2 transistors are on the same board ( psu ) as r003 / r005 ?
