panasonic 50 " vt30 - best settings for less judder ? .
dear users , i am a proud owner of a panasonic 50 " vt30 .... love the display and its capabilities but .... in some movies / tv shows ( i think depends on mixing / mastering of the video ) i get annoyed by the juddering .... - im sitting like 3meters away from my 50 " , is this too close and therefore i see it much clearly ?
- is there a way to make it less visible ?
hope you can help me out .
cheers , mitch .
