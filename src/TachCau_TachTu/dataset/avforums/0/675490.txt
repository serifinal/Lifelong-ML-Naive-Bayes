getting pixelation while watching sports !
please help ? .
i just recently bought a lg 50pv450 television - 50 '' class 1080p plasma tv and i was watching sunday night football on nbc tonight .
i noticed that at certain times when there was fast motion going on , when the screen was moving very fast that certain areas of my tv would get fuzzy or pixelated .
also , at certain times nbc has their hud come up to show you certain stats and what not .
whenever that transitioned on to the screen that area would get fuzzy/pixelated too .
but on the other hand i was watching transformers on tnt , an extremly fast paced movie as you probably know and i did n't see any problems , from what i can tell .
whats going on ?
am i just nitpicking right now or is something really going on ?
what can i do about this .
i just got the dang tv 3 days ago .
also , i noticed the my tv will starting dimming in and out in certain areas of the tv , like a pulsating effect .
thanks for the help in advance !
