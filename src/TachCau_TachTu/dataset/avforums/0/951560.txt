how to bed / break in a new plasma tv ? .
hi i have just ordered my self a samsung ps51d550 and i was hoping you you could advise on how to bed this tv in as i have never had a plasma tv before .
i have seen some say 100 hours some say 200 hours and other have said they have not done any kind of bed in .
would really like the advise on and what sort of setting use on the tv after how long will it be safe to play games on the tv and is it safe to use it as a pc monitor .
thanks
