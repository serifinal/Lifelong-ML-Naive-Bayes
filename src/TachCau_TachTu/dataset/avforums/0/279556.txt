panasonic tx - p42g30e plasma - vertical band problem , please help ! .
hi , some of the experts i can ' tell if the screen of my panasonic tv tx - p42g30e ( purchased a few days ago 14-01-2012 ) is defective from the attached photos ?
the photos were taken by placing the tv on av1 when no signal and raising the brightness ' .
the screen is not ' uniform and has a large halo in the center bottom of the screen plus a well - defined vertical band .
during scarrellate fast ( as in football ) , denotes the band that bears overlapping rather annoying !

if yes , how ?
also does anyone know if there is a software fix for this problem ?
i await the answer , thanks !
