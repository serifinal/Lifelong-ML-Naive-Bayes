panasonic 50gt30b - 3d picture not coming out of tv .
not sure if it just me but when viewing in 3d on my panasonic 50gt30b the image does n't really feel like it is coming out of the tv .
the 3d picture look great - very good quality and depth but when images are meant to feel like they are coming towards you they just do n't .
i did try another 3d tv in a shop once ( not sure what model it was ) and the images really felt like they were coming towards me .
i even felt like ducking .
so i 'm very disappointed with my tv at the moment .
is there something wrong with the tv or the settings ?
