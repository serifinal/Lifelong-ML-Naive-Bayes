faulty samsung plasma - sound but no picture .
i realise that the " sound but no picture " question must have been asked countless times ... so i apologise for starting another thread .
i 've had a search through different threads but need some specific info please .
first of all ... i have no experience in fixing tv 's but am hoping to save my mother a few quid as it 's her tv .
it 's a tevion 42 " plasma which is basically a samsung on the inside .
i removed the back cover and noticed a burning smell which i thought was coming from the ' y main ' and so i replaced that part however it made no difference .
i found the cause of the smell to be the ' y buffer ( up ) ' and the far right - hand chip seems to be the culprit as the gold pins have a burnt / brown patch .
i then removed the ' y buffer ( up ) ' and powered the set up ( not attached to any input ) .
this time the bottom half of the screen had multiple random coloured flashing pixels .
i 've found a replacement ' y buffer ( up ) ' but before ordering it i thought i 'd get some advice : a. from the fault i 've described does anyone know if a new ' y buffer ( up ) ' is likely to rectify the problem ?
b. i 've heard that a faulty buffer could damage the main ... is this true ?
as mentioned above i powered up the set briefly with the faulty buffer attached to the new main so i 'm hoping i have n't damaged that .
there also appears to be a fast clicking noise coming from the set but i do n't know if this is normal as it 's very faint and you have to put your ear really close to hear it .
there are no flashing led 's etc that give a fault code .
the power light goes from amber ( standby ) to green ( on ) as normal .
