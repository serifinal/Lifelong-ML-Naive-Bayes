lg 42px4dv - power protect mode , how to fix ? .
hi this morning the tv made a pop sound and the screen went blank .
audio could still be heard .
i removed the back panel and tested the fuses .
the 4ah fuse had blown .
i replaced the fuse with 3.1 ah -lrb- the psu board indicates use fuse between 2.5 ah - 4ah -rrb- .
i replaced the cover panel and powered up the tv , i heard the usual ` click ' sound when initially powering up , i switch on and the standby light goes from red , to amber to green .
it stays on green for a few seconds and then goes back to red .
i switch on again and it then only goes from red - amber .
can anyone offer any assistance please ?
many thanks in advance .
