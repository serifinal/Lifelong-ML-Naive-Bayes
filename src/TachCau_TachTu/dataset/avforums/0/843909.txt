re : panasonic 50 " vt30b - image shadow . .
i am not sure if this has been covered before in the forum , but i am noticing that in certain conditions , commentators etc. , seem to have a very slight black edge to the image .
it is barely perceptible but once noticed , it becomes irritating .
i am generally delighted with the picture , except for this issue .
my question is , is this normal ?
if not , what can i do to eradicate it ?
the viewing mode is , normal , with brightness and contrast at about 50 % and cats off .
any advice would be much appreciated .
