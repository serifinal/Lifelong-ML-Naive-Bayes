panasonic 46gt30 streaking ? .
hi guys , just bought a 46 '' gt30 and when turning this on i can see some horizontal streaking across the screen .
i attach a couple of photo 's trying to indicate this streaking .
it only appears for a couple of minutes when i first turn this on .
however , last night , it did not appear ?!
which was a welcome relief !

or is this just a teething problem with a new set ?
please advise !!!! cheers
