th50pz80b - separate settings for each hdmi ? .
had this set since almost launch and up until recently ( when i bought a sky hd box etc ) the settings for each hdmi did n't bother me .
however , i like to use the cinema setting and then tweak it to my own liking .
but i ca n't seem to set each hdmi separately .
if i choose hdmi 1 and setup the cinema setting , when i go to hdmi 2 or 3 , those settings carry across and if i tweak them on one of the other inputs , then they carry back across to hdmi 1 .
surely there is a way of me setting each input individually ?
thanks .
