vizio wo n't turn on .
i was watching tv and my vizio vp50 shut off .
no lights on or any indication of power .
i unplugged it and plugged back in .
any ideas where i can research and see if a component can be replaced ?
perhaps it 's a component for the power that needs replaced .
tv is 3 years old and out of warranty .
