dvi input on 436xde used for pc .
i know this has been mentioned before , but have any of the retailers / installers / calibrators worked out a way of persuading the 436 panel to accept an input other than the media receiver via dvi ?
i imagine the media box sends some sort of signal down the dvi cable to remind the panel of it 's presence .
