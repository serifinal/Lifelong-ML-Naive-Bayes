ca n't tune bbc channels .
i have a really old samsung le46n87bdr which is working fine for most channels but for some reason it wont pick up the bbc channels ?
when i autotune the first channel is itv and if i manually tune , it wont let me go down beyond channel 21 ( bbc is 1 and 2 ) .
anyone had this kind of problem before ?
also noticed when it autotunes it starts at 21
