panasonic plasma , strange screen problem .
i just got my new tv in the day and when i took it out of the box there was a dark bar down the left hand side , about an inch thick .
the bar was still there when i turned it on , i could see the picture through it but it was darker the rest of the picture .
any ideas on how it can be fixed or will i be sending it back .
thanks
