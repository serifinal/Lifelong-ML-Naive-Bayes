pdp - lx5090 not working with laptop .
i 'm trying to get my laptop to output to the tv with no joy .
i connect the laptop with vga cable direct to the vga computer input but the pc channel on the tv shows a " no input signal " error and the laptop does not recognise that an external display device i.e. the tv is attached .
i 've tried another laptop - same problem .
i 've tried a vga to composite connection - same problem .
i would be extremely grateful for any ideas .
regards .
