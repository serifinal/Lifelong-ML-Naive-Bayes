panasonic g20 - horizontal spotted blue lines .
i have a g20b and it is a year old and whilst watching virgin over hdmi roughly 20 horizontal blue lines 5 cm apart and maybe 2 mm width are slowly coming down my screen ( at a rate of maybe 1 a second ) !!!
on any input ( including the 3 possible hdmi inputs i have , viera cast , and anolouge ) there still there .
does any one have any ideas what this is and more importantly can i fix it ???? ( have tried leaving it of for an hour and also removing all but one inputs , resetting to factory conditions )
