panasonic vt30 - stops freeview recordings when onkyo receiver is on ? .
hey , i have a panasonic 50 '' vt30 which is superb on all fronts .
one issue i have is that when i record on freeview , or saorview here in ireland , when my onkyo 609 receiver is on then it wont record and `` rec pause '' or the likes constantly comes up on the top right corner .
even though it says pauses no recording takes place , until i turn off my receiver and then the vt30 will start to record ?
i was wondering is there a setting that i can change on either the tv or the receiver so that the recordings dont stop ?
thanks , branners
