faint vertical lines ( like banding ) on my plasma .
in a nutshell i always notice this when watching football ... what i have are 2 very very faint vertical bars ( like ' watermarks ' ) about an inch wide that run from the very top to the very bottom of the screen .
one is to the left of centre and the other around 4 inches from the right edge of the bezel .
initially i thought it could be like a banding effect or even transmission but playing with the zoom proved the problem lies with the screen .
the tv in question is a 50ps6000 which i 've had for a couple of months ... tbh i only ever notice this very rarely during tv - when there 's a consistent colour and the picture is panning - which is why it 's most niticable with football !
any ideas ?
should i just live with it ?
is it a fault or is it like lcd clouding - a limitation of the tech ?
i 've never noticed this effect ever before and have had a few plasmas of various makes .
thanks in advance
