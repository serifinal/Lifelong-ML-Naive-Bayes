hd freeview ` shutter or blinking ' effect .
whilst watching hd freeview on my lg 50 '' every 15-60 seconds i get a very brief black screen , similar to the shutter on a slr camera , or the blink of an eye .
it doesnt happen on blu ray , or my ps3 games .
i have retuned , checked settings , reset tv to factory settings , no cure yet .
any ideas ?
