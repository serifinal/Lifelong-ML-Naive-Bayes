help !
kuro pdp - lx5080 red blinking lights ! .
two days before christmas half way through motd and the screen makes a funny chirp noise , turns off and i &#8217; m left with a blinking red light ( x2 blinks ) .
it &#8217; s under warranty so no worries there ( fingers crossed ) but any ideas what it can be ?
and how long to repair &#8211; is it a house visit or a send away ?
( please , its christmas ! )
thanks in advance
