panasonic tx - p46gt30b - picture freeze .
hi , i recently bought a panasonic tx - p46gt30b and have been using the media centre to stream hd videos .
on occasion , whenever playing an mkv file , the picture will freeze and the following scenes will continue to play behind , wiping the frozen image out .
this error consistently occurs in the same places on the file playback .
also , when playing back on my pc , the error is not there - which indicates that the file is fine .
i am streaming the file from my nas drive and both the tv and nas are wired to my my router .
as far as i am aware i am running the latest firmware .
is there anything i am able to do to fix this problem ?
thank you ,
