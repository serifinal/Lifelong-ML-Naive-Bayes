pioneer 6090 making cracking noises .
hi all , over the last few weeks my tv has started making noises like it 's expanding . .
similar to when radiators heat up sometimes .
it 's loud enough sometimes that my loonatic spaniel sometimes pricks up her ears !
the noise is randon , from quiet to " crikey , it 's going to conk out " !
i called pioneer , they sent 2 engineers out . .
the engineers arrived and appeared to be glorified couriers as they did not have anything apart from screwdrivers and pliers with them !
they wanted to take the set away .
i was not happy with this because of the usual horror stories ; for all i know the expansion or flexing may well be fixed by travelling in the van . .
any advice on what to do ?
i 'm considering contacting pioneer again to see where i stand but i 'd like to hear what you guys think . .
cheers !
jas
