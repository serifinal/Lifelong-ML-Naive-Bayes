ps50c7000 - 3d is not available in hd .
hi , i have a problem with samsung ps50c7000 .
blu ray movies recreating 3d -lrb- with pc by power dvd -rrb- options 3d -lrb- checkerboard -rrb- i only appear at a max resolution of 1680x1050 which makes watching the image in a small window on the side of my big white empty areas which completely distorts the view .
why hd 1920x1080 i can not launch any videos -lrb- such as resident evil 3d ~ > 40gb -rrb- ?
it may have something to do with the fact that i do not have hdmi 1.4 only 1.3 ?
has anyone had this problem ?
