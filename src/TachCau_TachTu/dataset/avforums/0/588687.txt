ps50c7000 - 3d is not available in hd .
hi , i have a problem with samsung ps50c7000 .
blu ray movies recreating 3d ( with pc by power dvd ) options 3d ( checkerboard ) i only appear at a max resolution of 1680x1050 which makes watching the image in a small window on the side of my big white empty areas which completely distorts the view .
why hd 1920x1080 i can not launch any videos ( such as resident evil 3d ~ > 40 gb ) ?
it may have something to do with the fact that i do not have hdmi 1.4 only 1.3 ?
has anyone had this problem ?
