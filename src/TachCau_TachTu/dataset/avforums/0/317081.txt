panasonic aspect ratio problem tx - p42g15b .
help ... have a panasonic tx - p42g15b .
the fixed aspect ratios are 16:9 14:9 4:3 however 14:9 is not a narrower version of 16:9 , but seems to be a widened version of 4:3 .
when you go from 16:9 to 14:9 you expect the image height to remain the same , but the picture width to decrease .
what actually happens is that although the width of the picture shrinks , the height increases , and if you check you find that switching afterward to 4:3 the overall image shrinks again , but the aspect ratio does no change moving from 14:9 to 4:3 .
ie there is no true 14:9 , just a butchered version of 4:3 .
is this a known problem with plasmas / panasonic / this model or is there a fault .
been like this since purchase , and very annoying , because you can never get a true ratio , people are always too fat or too thin .
thanks for any help .
