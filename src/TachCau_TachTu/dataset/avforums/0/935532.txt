freeview hd channels on panasonic 50s20 .
hi i recently bought a panny 50s20 and freeview website says i should be able to receive hd channels from april this year but i ca n't seem to get them .
on the other digital channels my signal strength and quality are at about 8 so i think the aerial is ok .
i have tried re scanning for channels but they do n't appear on my channel list .
does anyone have any ideas ?
am i doing anything wrong ?
any suggestions would be appreciated .
thank you
