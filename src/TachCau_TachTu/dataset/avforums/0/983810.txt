very blurry 3d on a pn59d7000 ?
skandinavian model .
hi all : 0 ) so i recieved my samsung ps59d7005 yesterday .
( scandinavia model ) before that i had the samsung ue55d8005 edge led , but it was suffering from alot of clouding ... i must say that the ue55d8005 had the best picture i have ever seen on any led / plasma .
it was absolutely amazing picture quality .
i was a bit dissapointed when i tried to watch a 3d movie yesterday on the pn59d7000 .
it was very blurry and seemed out of focus , but it had nice depht .
i have tried everything in the settings to try to improve 3d picture quality but with no luck : 0 ( .
i found that turning of all sharpness settings helped a little bit , but it is far from the 3d quality of the ue55d8000 edge led .
im running my movies from a dlna server could that be a problem with this tv ? .
it ´s mkv x264 movies also i can not enable " cinema smooth " and that really bothers me , because i like the look i gives to the movies .
i have bought this new tv for the 3d experience , but im really disapointed in the picture quality in 3d .
pc / ps3 / tv / regular movies look ´s great on this set !
am i doing something wrong with my setup ?
do i need to install new firmware ?
is there any way to enable " cinema smooth " so that i can use it for movies and tv ?
best regards thesleeper
