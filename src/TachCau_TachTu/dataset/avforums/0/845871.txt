bbc hd breaking up on panasonic tv - tx - p46vt20b .
i have a panasonic plasma tv - tx - p46vt20b ( 2010 model ) .
i am now having problems watching freesat channels bbc one hd , bbc hd and channel 4hd .
i have followed the guide below this note and whilst i now receive these channels they are breaking up .
i have checked the signal condition / quality and this is " green " at about 80 % and the bit error rate never changes from 0.00 e +00 .
all other channels are fine .
i have even reset to " shipping condition " .
any ideas ?
is anyone else with this tv having the same problems ?
------------------------------------------------------------------------- instructions followed so far ...... .
hd boxes and tvs will not pick up either of the bbc hd channels , and customers will be presented with a blank screen and an error message saying &#8220; channel not available &#8221; or similar .
to rectify this , you will need to put your tv into standby for 30 seconds and then restart it to continue to receive the two bbc hd channels .
if the channels remain unavailable , then you will need to carry out a &#8216; shipping condition restart &#8217; .
full instructions can be found in the product manual .
