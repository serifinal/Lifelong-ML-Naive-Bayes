panasonic txp46gt30 problem with hdd media player playback .
hi all ... can anyone shed some light on this wierd little problem for me please ?
i 've had my panny txp46gt30 for a few days now and everything seems peachy that i 've tried so far apart from one thing .
i have a dvico tvix 65000 hdd media player that i use to stream movies , tv stuff , music etc to my pioneer plasma -lrb- which worked fine without problem -rrb- .
now i 've just upgraded to the panny and strangely when i 'm watching a movie using the media player -lrb- hooked up exactly the same way as the pioneer was -rrb- the sound goes off , followed a few seconds later by the picture .
the screen thgen goes all pixellated the blocky before going off alltogether .
the screen just goes blank as if there 's no signal ! .
this seems to occur about 30mins plus into the movie , and if i switch off the media player and back on i can resume where it went off before .
naturally i 've done all the usual things like checking cables , trying other hdmi ports on the tv etc and ca n't find anything out of the ordinary that could cause this ! .
does anyone know of an issue with this make of tv and media players ?
basically i 'm at a complete loss as to why this is happening ! .
i 've also rang the shop where i bought it from and they 've suggested to try the old tv again to see if the media player is faulty which i 'm doing right now .
also they 've suggested me bringing in the media player for them to see if it does it for them .
so that 's it ... any suggestions would be very welcome
