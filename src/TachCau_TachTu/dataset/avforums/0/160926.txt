panasonic tx-42s30b - frame rate issue/settings .
hello , wondering if anyone can throw some light on this , , i have just bought the about tv , its lovely , really impressed by the picture on it.apart from one thing , i was watching a 720p film on my vbridge/hissense media player last night and noticed every now and then the framerate seemed to judder. , , the same film does not do this on my old asda lcd 720p tv .
have i got something set wrong , , the hisense is set to 1080p/60hz -lrb- could try 50hz -rrb- as appost to 720p/60hz on the old lcd .
the intellegent frame creation - max viewing mode-cinema resolution enhancer-max pixel orbiter-auto all i can see to adjust on it really.thank very much for any help
