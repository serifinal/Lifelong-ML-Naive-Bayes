plasma tv security .
for the second time in 8 months scumbags have stolen a 42 " panasonic from a community hall i 'm responsible for first time they wrecked the place by kicking doors in etc and other than the tv the took very little else .
this time they were more considerate and made very little mess ....... but still took the tv and mount ( in fact so little mess the insurance company are quibbing about whether they 'll pay out ! ) .
so my question is how would you go about securing a replacement to the wall ?
bearing in mind that the previous two were bolted at a height of 7 ' and they literally ripped the whole thing off in one go ( made a hell of a mess of the wall / plaster ) .
it has to be fixed on a cantilever type bracket as it sits in the corner and we swing it out when in action so to speak .
i did consider ceiling mount but this is quite high at about 15 ' and is only a suspended ceiling , so no real strength ( though it could be possible to put some trusses in to provide support if needed ) .
so annoyed at this as it affects elderly people who only use it now and again , and it 's got to the point of whether to renew or not , which really gets me as it 's like giving in to the **** s that do this sort of thing .
do n't help that the police could n't give a t *** and have n't even bothered to take details of the equipment taken which is security coded and pin numbered , plus we found a jar that was taken at the same time which clearly has evidence on it ( all they ensure is that i 'm given a sodding crime ref ) .
sorry for the rant but any advice would be greatly appreciated
