42px70 common sense run - in .
there have been a lot of comments on this and some people seem to be running their set on unwatchable settings for no apparent reason using the following settings ( taken from http://www.hdtvtest.co.uk ) from day one will cause your set no damage at all and will actually be watchable .
picture menu viewing mode : cinema contrast : no change brightness : 2 clicks left colour : no change sharpness : no change colour balance : warm colour management : off p - nr : off the following common sense tips ( also from hdtvtest.co.uk ) will suffice during the tv 's first few weeks : avoid prolonged static images being displayed anywhere on the screen , including logos and menu bars , idle computer images ... etc. .
avoid watching shows in pillar box or letterbox format .
use the zoom or change film aspect ratios to get rid of them .
using grey side masks or panel can reduce screen burn risks in pillar boxed format , but try not to get in that situation in the first place .
do n't use excessive contrast level setting in the early days .
image retention is temporary and can disappear quickly with uniform screen grey out or snow images .
there really is nothing else you need to do , enjoy your tv from day one and you might even find the missus likes it ( and you ) a bit more bob
