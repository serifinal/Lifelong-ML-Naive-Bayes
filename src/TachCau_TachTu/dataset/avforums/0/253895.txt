3d detection problem on new panasonic st31 .
i purchased a panasonic 50st31 from comet 3 days ago but seem to be having a problem with the 3d detection .
whilst watching some 3d content through my v + box the tv started constantly jumping between 3d & 2d for about 2 minutes , making it completely unwatchable .
it seemed liked it was struggling to detect the 3d content .
i rewound the programme to make sure it was not this particular part of the programme causing the problem but it did n't do it the second time .
i had the 3d detection set to on & not advanced as earlier in the day whilst playing call of duty on split screen it was also switching from 2d to 3d , but i put this down to exactly the same images being displayed in both halves of the screen hence confusing the tv into thinking it was a 3d image .
i think i will contact comet this morning to arrange an exchange on the tv .
