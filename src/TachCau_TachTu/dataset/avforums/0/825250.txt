panasonic p55gt30 plasma out of focus picture .
p55gt30 - a great deal of the time upwards of 70 % of the hd picture -lrb- dish network -rrb- is out of focus , even when there is no motion .
2 people can be sitting at a table talking and the one on the left is in focus , one on the right blurry .
then the picture will switch to a commercial and everything , foreground all the way into the distance is clear .
the focused portions of the picture are great , and i can understand some blurring when there is motion , but people that are sitting still or inanimate objects in the background ?
we owned a plasma before and never had this issue .
sorry , i 've got zip technical background but have made a number of adjustments based on some recommended settings i found here and other web sites , but none have resolved the blurring problems .
appreciate any advice , i still have two weeks in which to return the tv to amazon .
