techwood twp4210 .
having just joined i would like to say thanks for the help and thoughts imparted on these forums .
i have bought the dsg techwood plasma 4210 and am impressed by the quality .
i read a couple of threads about what the tuner box is so i slid the top off and had a looksee inside .
on the lable on the underside of the tuner is the words plasma42 -lrb- lg -rrb- .
this backs up the installers info that the 4210 is a rebadged lg inside -lrb- attached if i can is an pic -rrb- it has a sticker with the same info plasma42lg .
a few of the bigger chips are labled .
pixelworks pw181 and pw1231 .
thepanel controller is a sillicon image panel link chip .
i must say this panel / setup is pretty good for the price .
i will agree with the rest of the comments that scart/rgb connections are briliant from $ ly plus box .
panny e30 and xbox .
poor reception from terrestial tv tuner from a good ariel setup via booster though .
as per other threads the setup is best viewed from at least 15 foot , any closer and i get a headach after about 5 mins .
i am happy .
no i am more like a dog with 2 tails .
lol .
