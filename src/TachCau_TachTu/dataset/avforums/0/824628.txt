pioneer pdp - 508xd plasma - where can i find picture settings for virgin v + hd ? .
hi , i really need some help , some pointing in the right direction .
having purchased my pioneer 508xd a few years ago , i 've used bumtious ' picture settings to calibrate my plasma .
i was using sky hd / sd , and the picture looked superb using his settings .
recently i 've had to change to virgin hd ( using their virgin v + hd box ) .
i 've searched high and low for the best picture settings in this forum , but have failed to find any .
i 've tried adjusting my picture settings myself , but ca n't get them looking as good compared to my old sky hd settings .
my 508 is still amazing , and just want to know that i 've got the optimum settings for picture quality when using my new virgin box .
can anyone help ?
any advice would be greatfully appreciated .
many thanks
