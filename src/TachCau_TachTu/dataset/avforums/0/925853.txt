does mll ( black levels ) , floating blacks problems etc still exist in plasmas today ? .
after the bad stuff i been hearing within the last 3 years regarding these problems with plasma sets .
are the problems still there with plasmas now or have they gone ?
did every plasma tv suffered these problems within the last few years ?
if not which models were problem free ?
thanks ,
