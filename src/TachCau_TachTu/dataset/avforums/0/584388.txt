samsung psxxd450 / psxxd490 .
just wondered if anyone else had picked one of these up ?
these are samsung 's low end 4 series 720p hd ready tvs , 43 " and 51 " varieties ( the odd sizes are selling points : the frame is reduced to 1 " , which makes for a very attractive tv imo ) .
the d490 is 3d capable , the d450 is 2d only .
having seen one in jl , i pulled the trigger on the 51d450 and i 'm very impressed !
the picture is great ( sd and hd , although if i was sitting any closer to a set this big i 'd look towards 1080p ) and i have n't noticed any ir at all .
this was my big fear coming from lcd .
no 50hz bug and no major issues with fast moving objects either ( which put me off getting a panasonic 50g20 ) .
it is n't network enabled , unfortunately , but it plays music / videos / photos via usb .
gaming is a treat - the set seems very responsive and crysis 2 on my 360 looks insane .
my only real complaints are : it only has 2 hdmi inputs and the base / stand is a gloss black dust magnet .
