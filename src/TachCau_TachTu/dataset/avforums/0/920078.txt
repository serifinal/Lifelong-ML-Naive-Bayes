possible problem with new samsung ps59d6900 some advice plz .
hi folks , well i have had the new 59 d6900 here in the uk for 1 month now with a 5 year warranty .
i have noticed that at the top of the screen is a faint line going horizontally al the way along the top .
now it does n't move or anything when a movie is in full screen .
when the film is wide screen the faint line is just below the top black edge of the widescreenblack strip .
so basically the line is always on show depending where the picture ends .
its not a bad dark line , just faint strip .
should i send the tv back ?
should i ignore it ?
is it a known common problem ?
what could it be ?
also on some blue ray movies and iplayer ( both used from my ps3 connected by hdmi cable ) the sound seems to go quieter and then louder .
what could this be ?
i havent setup my onkyo surround system yet as im moving soon so its currently just running with the tv stock speakers .
many thanks on any help you can give me n whether i should return the tv for aanother one .
thank you peter
