lg 50pc55 part numbers different .
hi all , i have an lg 50pc55 50 inch plasma tv , had it for a few years until my 3 year old son decided to throw his toy car at it and cracked the screen , now no sound or picture but still turns on .
the screen part is extremly hard to find but found one in america second hand very cheap but a very silly postage price .
i do nt have insurance on it and cant claim on it either , i have found another lg 50 inch tv and he is selling the screen , the part numbers however , are a little different , beginning of the numbers are the same but then changes , but its look exactly the same and so do all the parts on it .
my main question is , would that screen still work on mines even if the part numbers are different ??
regards
