burn - in on lg pk590 plasma .
after just a few months of using the plasma ( tv , blueray , xbox , various use duration - anything from 5 min to 8hours ) there appears to be a white burn - in in the bottom left and right corners .
to be more specific these are elements from one of xbox games bad company 2 ( frame and digits size 3 inch by 3 inch ) .
it 's barely visible ( mainly on a black background ) nevertheless you can spot it .
i made lg aware of the problem .
they came back with two points : the first is that warranty does not cover burn - in and the second is to run ?
white wash ?
which is simply white image which you need to keep on for some time .
i?ve done the ?
white wash ?
no improvement at all .
not quite sure what else i can do to fix it .
now , i was aware of the concept of burn - in before i purchased this plasma and i was particularly careful not to leave still images for prolonged periods .
but hey you can?t help it sometimes some channels / games will have some still images present for some time ?
that?s the way it is - i bought the plasma to use and enjoy it not to have it off or on 20 % of brightness to prevent burn - in .
despite this the screen still suffered .
i think this is quite bad that it is so easy to get burn - in on this otherwise good quality product .
i think lg should warn you and write it in bold and capital letters in documentation attached to the product how to prevent it ( if possible ) because once it happens it is your problem since lg told me that this is not covered by the warranty .
i wonder if anyone knows how to fix this problem , in possible at all .
cheers
