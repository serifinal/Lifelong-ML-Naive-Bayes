jl 5yr warranty with second hand tv .
a number of us used the john lewis pricematch to get out tvs and the 5yr warranty , which is very very nice .
but , what if we were sell our tv to someone else when upgrading -lrb- size of course -rrb- .
will the warranty be able to be transfered over to the new owner , or will it be void with the new owner ?
not intending to go 50inch yet , as i have no money , but i really do n't know if i can hold off the upgraditis for 5 more years
