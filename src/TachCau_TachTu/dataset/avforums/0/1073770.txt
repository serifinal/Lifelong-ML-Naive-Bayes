is this a good deal for a panasonic tx-p42s30 plasma ? .
i can get a panasonic tx-p42s30 plasma from a local retailer for # 545 including the 5 year warranty , plus they also offer a tv swap out service .
is this any better than the normal panasonic warranty ?
is the swap out service really worth while ?
i have a spare tv to use should any new tv fail . .
cheers .
