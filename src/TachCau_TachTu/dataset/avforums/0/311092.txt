panasonic tx-p50gt30b sounds `` tinny '' .
hi just recieved the above tv a few days ago but i feel the sound is quite `` tinny '' compared to the 7 year old plasma i 've just replaced ... i quite like a lot of bass and ive looked in the sound menu etc and played around with settings etc but still sounds weak .
ive tried the preset sound choices and the equaliser but still sounds poor to me .
is there something im missing .
thanks sorry im in the wrong section ... reposted in plasma thread .
