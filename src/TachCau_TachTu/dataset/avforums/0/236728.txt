sony bravia kdl - 26s2030 9 blinks .
hey everyone !
yesterday my dad came home with a sony bravia he picked up from a flat he lets out which had been left by the previous person staying there , i tried it today and although it works it turns off randomly and the you have to press the power button to get it on again , after 2 - 3 times of doing this the tv 's power / standby light flashes red 9 times and pauses for 2/3 seconds and does nt stop until you unplug the power cable , i 've looked all over the web and have heard it can be 2 diodes ( d 6116 and d 6301 ) but i cant find them on the tv 's power board so i think thats a fix for a defferent model , other threads on this forum have said it could be a tuner card but im completely stumped : / can anyone help me please ?
many thanks , curtis .
i forgot the link to the other thread : sony bravia standby light flashes 9 times and have i got this thread in the right place lol ?
