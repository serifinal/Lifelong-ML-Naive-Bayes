panasonic plasma g30 skin blurring problem .
hi everyone , can anyone help me out there ?
bought a panny g30 50 inch last week .
what 's going on with skin tones ??
there is a very noticeable " blurring " every time a character turns their head .
i previously had a g10 and noticed the same issue , albeit to a lesser degree .
can anyone tell me what this is , will it go away through time , is their an ideal picture setting to minimise it ?
any replies greatly appreciated
