samsung ps42q7hd and dnie .
i have this display and thought i would give the turning off dnie ago , to see if it would make any difference .
however , the dnie bypass option just isnt there , went to the correct menu , second column no dnie bypass anywhere .
anyone have any ideas , or have samsung removed it to stop us playing .
cheers .
