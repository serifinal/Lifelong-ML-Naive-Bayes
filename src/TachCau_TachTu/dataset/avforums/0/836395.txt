styling on the ' 30 ' panasonic range .
although they do make great plamsa tv 's , i think the styling on most of their sets is still poor compared to the competition , even on the current range .
the vt30 is the nicest though , but too expensive !
i am getting the gt50 on monday , but i do n't like the white fading effect on the front where the panasonic logo is , or the thin silver border around the panel .
i will compromise on looks though , as i have always preferred the panasonic plasmas overall quality .
i do think that the styling of the gt30 is a massive improvement from any previous models though and way better than the ugly st30 with its wide frame and cheap looking bevel effect .
it looks like a throwback from the 90's .
