philips plasma repair advice thread .
hi , my 18 month old philips plasma has decided to stop working .
i have a 37fd9944 / 01s that has a seperate tuner box .
when you turn on the display the led goes green for a few seconds then switches to a continuosly rapid flashing red with no picture .
i figured it must be the display as i connected my xbox 360 straight in and it still did the same thing .
i contacted philips who could not help without sending the unit away to be inspected ( at my own cost ) .
i then contacted the retailer , discount electronics uk , who could n't have been more unhelpful .
does anyone have any ideas as to what could have happened or any links to some technical advice on philips plasma ( i 've already checked philips.com ) cheers , h_p .
