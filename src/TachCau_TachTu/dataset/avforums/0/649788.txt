lg rz42px11 - smoke ! .
hi , my lg is about 6 years old and while watching tv , the picture lost some colour and then smoke came out the top .
luckily i cought this early and switched it off quickly .
as it turns out , the only faulty component i was able to find was a 6u8f unpolarised polyester capacitor on the y-sus board -lrb- popped open -rrb- and the 47uf , 250v electrolitic next to it which seemed damaged -lrb- slightly swolen -rrb- by the heat generated by the 6u8f .
no other components have any visual damage .
has anyone had similar problems and has anyone had a capacitor as a single fault on a y-sus board ?
help would be greatly appreciated !
