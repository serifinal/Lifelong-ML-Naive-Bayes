moving picture resolution .
i only really found out about this because panasonic publish this information .
does anyone else ?
would be interesting to see what the values for this really are on new plasma / lcd sets .
surely this is much more important than static .
does anyone not watch a moving picture on their tv ?
how do tv companies get away with this ?
how many consumers are buying a full hd set with a low ' moving picture resolution ' ( mpr ) or perhaps newer lcd / plasma have quite a high mpr and the consumer is ok .
well who knows as its impossible to find any information on this
