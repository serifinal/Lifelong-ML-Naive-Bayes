panasonic plasma posterisation and colour banding 2010/2011 .
its been pointed out that there is confusion about these issues and the 50hz bug .
as there is a good thread going on regarding 50hz on 2010/2011 models why not one dedicated to this stuff ?
there 's been plenty of posts about it spread over many threads but not a focussed discussion or opportunity to get informed opinion .
so whats it all about ?
well i have a 46g20 , 6 months old now .
i love it on blu - rays and my hddvds .
can happily lose myself in the film , great picture !
( see , there 's the balance ) watching tv programs i often see the weird picture processing problems of posterisation and colour banding on faces .
its been described already by me and others in some detail and i find it maddeningly annoying !
some have sold up rather than put up with it .
its been seen on the new models too !
now in the recent reviews both on here and elsewhere i kind of get a feeling of having my wrist being slapped for being so petty as to not just put up with it !
it is apparently a minor issue , generic plasma stuff going on , nothing to worry about !
what causes it ?
is there something wrong with my tv ?
am i being over critical ?
