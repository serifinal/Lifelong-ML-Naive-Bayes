panasonic p42ut30b strange dots .
i just purchased this tv today and i was happy with it until you go to a black screen ( ps3 , tv , xbox , anything ) you can see what i 'd almost call snow from a regular old set however it is grey , red and sometimes green dots .
is this a new plasma problem that resolves itself over time or what ?
i 'm pretty worried so any help will be very much appreciated !!!!!
