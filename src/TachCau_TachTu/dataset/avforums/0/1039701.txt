panasonic p50vt20 turning off / on by itself .
my p50vt20 has started turning off and back on again by itself , seems to happen completely randomly but at times it is almost not possible to get it to stay on for longer than 10 seconds .
yet other times it runs for hours with no problems .
i have removed all connections from it and tried different wall sockets .
did a factory reset in case there is some kind of corruption on the channel guide or something but to no avail .
fortunately i have the 5 year cover direct with panasonic and it 's being taken away to be looked at on monday .
ca n't say i 'm over the moon at the idea of it being carted off , maybe it 's a bit paranoid but i think i will take some photos of the condition of it , model number , hours watched etc. .
anyone had the same problem ?
