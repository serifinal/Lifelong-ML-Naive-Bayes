plasmasync plasma monitor and nakamichi sound space 10 .
hello , i have jus acquired a plasmasync plasma monitor px - 42vp4pg and a nakamichi sounds pace 10 home theatre system and have absolutely no idea where to start setting them up !
i ' vemanaged to connect the surround sound to the monitor and had a dvd playing .... .
i then got a he digital freeview set top box and ca n't for the life of me work out how to connect everything !!
i 'm not fussed about having it hd it would be nice but as long as it works i 'd be happy ... is this even possible ?
any help would be greatly appreciated !!
many thanks , a very clueless emma !
