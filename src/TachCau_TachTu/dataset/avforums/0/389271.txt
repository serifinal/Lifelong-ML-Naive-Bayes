lg 50pz550t has turned itself off twice ! .
hi , just bought my lg 50pz550t 50 " plasma 4 days ago and it 's been perfect untill today when it switched itself off this morning and then did the same again this afternoon !
as soon as it turned itself off i switched it back on by the remote and all was fine ??
but to do this twice in 1 day when it 's just 4 days old is a bit odd is n't it ?
thanks .
