samsung screen filter removal .
hi the story is my samsung plasma got a small scratch in it so i thought i would polish it out with t - cut like i do with great affect on cd and dvds , but silly me did n't bother to do any research into it so now i know there is a filter on the screen as i have rubbed some of it away so the question is what can i use to get all the filter off easily as i do n't fancy doing the full 50 " screen with t - cut as i probably wo n't get into the corners and edges fully ?
