samsung ps50 c7000 plasma tv .
i purchased this model tv in early february 2011 from amazon .
the tv is just what i wanted and has lots of good points but has suffered from momentarily flicking off during transmission .
i am on my third tv and used the 3d over the bank holiday and the transmission flicked off once again.this also occurs on 2d but not as often .
this is particularly annoying in 3d as you have to go through the menu again to log back on .
i do n't think its anything to do with connections , as if you playback on ' sky ' the transmission is uninterrupted.i am now at my wits end and about to return the tv for a full refund by amazon.has any body had similar experiences with this model ?
any suggestions as to the possible cause , or am i just unlucky?km .
