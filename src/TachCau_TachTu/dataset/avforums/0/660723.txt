pioneer plasma standby issue ( no , not the usual flashing lights one ! ) .
anyone know anything about this issue ?
i 've had it for sometime and just put it down to a setting i 've mistakenly changed or similar but i see one other person has posted it ( so long ago avf wo n't let me post this as a reply to it - there were no replies i should also point out ) .
i ca n't find any other reference to this particular issue anywhere .
pressing power on remote switches my pdp - 436xde into standby ( both receiver and panel ) .
receiver goes ' red light ' instantly , panel cycles between red ( standby ) and blue ( power on ) for a few seconds before going dark ( no lights ) to turn the tv back on i either have to get up and physically press the receiver 's power button and / or turn the panel off at its power button and then back on .
not the greatest problem in the world for a tv that i 've had nothing but good things from in its 6 years with me but if there are any solutions i 'd love to hear them .
cheers nick
