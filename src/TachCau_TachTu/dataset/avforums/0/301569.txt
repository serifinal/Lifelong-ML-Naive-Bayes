flashing horizontal line when in 3d - panasonic -lrb- vt30 , gt30 and st30 -rrb- .
hi , i 've just got the 50 '' panasonic st30 .
a few days old now .
i plugged it in last sunday -lrb- 08/01/12 -rrb- .
watching sky 3d tonight i noticed a completely horizontal flashing / flickering line / bar to the bottom of the set about 1cm from the bottom .
this was in 3d mode .
when you dont have 3d mode activated but watch a 3d channel you get two images , the bar was only present on the left image and stopped at the centre of the tv where the right image started .
the the flashing bar was also present when the tv was in 3d mode .
at first i presumed it might have been some nastyness in the recording so i viewed a recorded 3d program i had on my sky plus box .
the flashing bar was present then as well .
i have n't been able to replicate the problem since .
both the sky program i recorded and the one playing live now is ok ... the bar definitly seemed like something nasty happening in the tv set .
prehaps an issue with the image processor or something .
i 've watched currently since purchase about an hours worth in total of 3d footage and have n't seen this .
can anyone shed some light on this potential issue .
i 'm really hoping its not the tv .
