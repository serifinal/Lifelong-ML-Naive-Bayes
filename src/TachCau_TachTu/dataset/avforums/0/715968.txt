panasonic tx - p42g20b - repaired but awful pic .
hello .
i bought one of these in november 2010 , and about 6 weeks ago it stopped working .
oh yes , the 7 blinks of death .
so we reported it to comet and they arranged for an engineer to come out .
the next day after the 7 blinks came up , a spider web type crack appeared on the screen .
we updated comet .
they were useless and mucked us around for several weeks .
eventually after more than a month , the tv was repaired and delivered back to us .
however , the picture does nt look anywhere near as good as it did before it went pop .
it is like it is a different television .
it isnt the settings - i 've put them to how i had them before .
the contrast isnt anywhere as good , there is a lot of pixelation and blurriness or blockiness .
one of the things that impressed me so much when i first bought it , was how well it displayed sd pictures .
now that we 've got it back from repair , it is almost unwatchable .
even the hd stuff isnt as sharp and clear as before .
i 've checked the signal quality and strength and they are as strong as before .
so i wonder , could they have replaced the panel with a more inferior model ?
is this a possibility ?
how would i find out for sure ?
comet are sending an ' engineer ' out on monday but going by their current poor service and the previous engineer who knew less than i did about the set , i can guess he will just try and fob us off and tell us we 've changed the settings and merely fiddle with them himself , so i 'm keen to get some more thoughts on it before then .
any suggestions or advice will be most appreciated .
regards , greg
