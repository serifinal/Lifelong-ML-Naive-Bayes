panny g20 hdd recording .
i 'm aware that the g20 re-formats the hdd to ensure that recordings can not be played back on other devices ... .
however ... having used the hdd for a few weeks i now need to use it to back up my laptop .
the only problem is that my laptop can no longer see the drive to let me re-format it .
is this right ?
... .
are we saying here that once the hdd has been formatted for use with the tv there is effectively no going back ?
