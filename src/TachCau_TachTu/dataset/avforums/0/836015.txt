panasonic vt30 image retention help .
so i returned the sony xbr55hx929 that i bought to get a vt30 and so far i 've been pretty happy with it .
only real complaints i have is that when i play 30 fps games , the judder is really noticeable .
also , when i get closer to the screen , when i move the camera it seems as if certain parts of the screen get grainy until i stop moving it .
that aside , my real question is about some ir i 'm having trouble with .
this is my first plasma so maybe it still needs more time to break in and i 'm being impatient .
when i first got it i ran break in slides for 100 hours non stop .
from there , i started gaming on it .
have n't really had too much ir problems ( most goes away in a few minutes ) , but today when i turned on my tv i saw images from my game i played last night .
i ran the anti-image retention scrolling white bar three times ( 15 minutes a time ) and it 's still there .
is it possible i already have burn in ?
