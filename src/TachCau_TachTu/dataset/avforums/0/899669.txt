panasonic viera th - 42pz800b problems .
i really hope somebody has some insight on this , basically i had my laptop connected through hd cable to my viera , as i pressed the volume up button on the remote the tv switched to a self check screen all black with white text , it says everything is ok .
i then turned the tv of and unplugged for 5 minutes plugged this back in and it came up to auto tune sort of screen and then asked me to enter a new pin to help police and security ??? no matter what button i press on the remote it goes back to this " self check " screen with the black backround and white text .
please someone if you know anything i would be so grateful .
thanks in advance karl .
