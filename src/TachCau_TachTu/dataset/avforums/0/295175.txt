panasonic g30 usb recording .
hello just bought a g30 -lrb- super -rrb- , are you able to use any usb stick , or usb powered drive , or is there a specifc one that has to be plugged into a wall socket ?
i have had a look on panasonics site , but i could not see anything .
i probably missed it !
thanks !
