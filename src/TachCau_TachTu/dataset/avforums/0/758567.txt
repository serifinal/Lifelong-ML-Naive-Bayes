samsung ps50c700 with red blinking light ? .
i have noticed today that my samsung ps50c7000 plasma 's red power light keeps blinking .
its repeating three blinks and then a pause .
the tv is working fine with nothing obvious to indicate a fault .
is this some kind of error code or is it nothing to worry about ?
any help would be greatly appreciated .
thanks in advance .
