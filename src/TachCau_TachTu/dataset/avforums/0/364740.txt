panasonic tx - p46st30b yellow ghosting / intrusion .
just get this tonight and whilst watching bright scenes there seems to be a yellowing ghosting intrusion visible around objects in the scene .
most noticeable on the bright scene when you move your eyes around the scene and blink , can still be seen whilst trying to keep eyes steady on the scene .
seems to vanish when doing the 2d to 3d conversion .
happens both on freeview and on external freesat .
any ideas from anyone please .
