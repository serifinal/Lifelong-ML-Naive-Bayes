a little help please .
alright guys ...... i just got myself a 427xa and its great .
but i have problems dealing with settings .
i had a sony plasma before this .... rocking pq and i understood all the settings and what to do with them .
but man there 's like 10 times more on the pioneer .
what are your settings when viewing pal dvd 's .
i watched pitch black last night and im sure i had the settings set wrong .
what should be on / off to achieve better pq ?
btw does this plasma get better when it ages abit ?
..... would the black levels get better with time and stuff like that ?
help is appreciate it ..... and thanks .
