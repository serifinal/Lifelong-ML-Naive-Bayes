panasonic g30 professional calibration settings ? .
hi guys i got myself a g30 46 " panny this week .
did anyone here get their g30 professionally calibrated ?
if so , can you post the exact settings you ended up with after calibration ?
is that ok to ask ?
i tried the setting from the flatpanelshd.com review but it was too dim for my taste .
looked bland and lifeless ( the ' game ' profile is more to my liking ) also , my panel has very loud buzzing , noticable even at volume 15 .
is this normal during first 100 hrs ?
thanks !
