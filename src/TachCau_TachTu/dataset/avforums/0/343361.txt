soap opera effect on samsung plasma .
hello everyone , its more then 1 year since i have my samsung ps50c7700 plasma and i 'm more then satisfied with it , however last week i went to a local store to check new tv 's and they had this `` video '' effect that looked very nice .
i have read on this and this seems to be caused by higher fresh rates .
is there a setting i can turn this `` video effect '' on my tv ?
would love it on my blurays and sport events on tv .
hope you guys can help .
