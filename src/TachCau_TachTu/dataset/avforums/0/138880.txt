just sold my th-42px80 and bought a tx-p50c3b .
hi i have just bought a tx-p50c3b to replace my 4yo th-42px80 .
i ordered the tv for # 399 which seemed like a bargain , it will be connected to a nas running whs2011 via hdmi .
i have not found a lot of info on the new tv other than a few reviews which are not really that encouraging .
the old tv was great but when i was offered # 350 it seemed like a no brainer to change it for a new bigger set for only # 49 .
i sit about 10 feet from the tv in a fairly dark room & it will be connected to the nas , skyhd , xbox360 & sony s380br -lrb- both barely used -rrb- via an hdmi switch .
i did like the look of the tx-p50g30b at # 549 in currys but it is now out of stock & i would have had difficulty convincing the wife on the extra # 150 .
has anyone any idea how the picture quality will compare with my old set , have i made a mistake ?
thanks andrew
