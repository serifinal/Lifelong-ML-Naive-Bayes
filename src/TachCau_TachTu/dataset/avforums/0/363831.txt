help !
only can see 1080i video on my th - 37px25 .
greetings , i am totally at the end of my rope .
last night my panisonic th - 37px25 got in to a strange " funk . "
i was watching a football game ( american ) in hd and after it was over , my wife switched the input to where i have our directv tivo attached .
the video ( component ) from my directv unit would not display .
i can get audio , but no video .
so i switched to the input for the dvd player , same story .
when i switched to the antenna input , the only video i can get are the channels broadcasting in high def .
the standard def channels are all audio only .
i even plugged in an external hd set top i have for another tv , same story , only the hd channels show video .
it seems like the tv will only display video in 1080i .
i have tried everything i can think of ... going through all the setup menus , plugging in another device into one of the componet inputs , switching cables , upgrading the firmware , with no success .
i wanted to post this to see if any of you have any ideas before log a service call .
this is driving me crazy .
thanks , doug knight
