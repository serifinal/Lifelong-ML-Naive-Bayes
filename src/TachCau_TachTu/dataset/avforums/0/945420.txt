lg 3d plasma 50pw450t best settings please .
hi guys .
i got this tv last week and never having had a plasma tv before i 'm really struggling to get a decent picture from it .
is setting up a plasma so different from an lcd ?
i 've had 3 lg lcd 's and never had much problems re picture settings .
i ca n't find any threads about this tv anywhere .
does anyone have any suggestions .
many thanks
