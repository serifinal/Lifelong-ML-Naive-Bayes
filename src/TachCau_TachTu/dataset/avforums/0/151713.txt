hitachi 42pd6600 video display fault .
hi all , i have a hitachi 42pd6600 .
last week the tv would not output any signal on the screen except from the scart2 socket .
no component ( xbox 360 ) or hdmi ( ps3 ) or any other input would work .
freeview digi box and xbox 360 scart were tested and only scart2 would allow a picture to be displayed .
when i selected the input ( hdmi , component , any other scart ) in the channel select menu the tv would lock up , display a black screen and the tv would not accept any input from the remote control .
i had to either turn off the tv or wait for ages till the tv reset itself to channel 11 .
i had a service engineer visit from comet and he did n't really do much except confirm the fault .
he said that the video board would need replacing in the tv and when he finds out which board it is he would return and replace it , probably in about a week .
after he left i input the engineers code on the remote , as i had seen him do it and memorised the code , and with nothing to loose i performed a factory reset in the engineers menu and now everything works fine !!
the question now is do i get them to replace the board or do i leave it and hope everything is ok ??
my warranty expires in jan 2009 .
thanks in advance folks !
