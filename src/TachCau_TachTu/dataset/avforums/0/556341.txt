tx - p42v20b - i 'm not panicing yet .
just taken delivery of the panny tx - p42v20b to replace my sammy le40m87bd first impressions out of the box - disappointing .
i know there 's lots of messing about to come but the sammy sky hd pictures were better & there seems to be huge variation in picture quality across hd , sd & freeview anybody have the link to a tx - p42v20b set up suggestions ?
will keep you informed
