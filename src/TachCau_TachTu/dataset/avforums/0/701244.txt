techsurgeons .
they came up on a google shopping search and appear to offer suspiciously low pricing .
however , they claim to have a shop ( in birmingham ) and speaking to them , they sounded very plausible .
they also claim to be panasonic approved dealers .
any stories - good or bad ?
considering a panny 42g30 for £ 449 + £ 79 5 yr extended warranty .
i suppose one way to find out would be to see if john lewis would price match !
