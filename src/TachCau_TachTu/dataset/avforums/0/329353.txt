panasonic g20 subtitles ono bbc 1 hd .
if i watch bbc1 hd on freesat with subtitles on and ` mute ' enabled , my g20 -lrb- bought 11/2010 -rrb- locks up and has to be power cycled .
interestingly turning the sound down instead of pressing mute avoids the problem !
does any one else get this ?
i have the latest software i think simon
