pioneer pdp - 433pe broken or needs media box .
i found a pioneer pdp - 433pe 42 ` plasma screen at the garbage hoping to see if i could fix it .
when i try to turn it on the red standby light flashes and when i try to press the button to get out of standby the green light flashes a few times and i hear the clicking sound but the tv does nt turn on and goes back to that red light .
i connected it to my computer , it has a port that looks like a normal dvi port but it says " system cable " white and gray and the dvi fits the white one .
the computer does recognize the screen type but still the same problem .
theres no media box or remote .
so i heard i might need a media box but then i read this : quote :
