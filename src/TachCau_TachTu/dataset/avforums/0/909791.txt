my panasonic tx - p55vt30 has almost half screen slightly darker , any clues ? .
hi everybody , i 'm pretty new on this forum but i have a problem and i believe you 're the only ones who could help me figure it out .
1 week ago i bought a panasonic tx - p55vt30 and i 'm actually doing the break in routine with the dvd iso playing on my cyclone mkv 2 via hdmi .
now during the break in process some solid colours are displayed and i 've noticed that almost half of the screen ( is not perfectly central as it starts over the p of the panasonic logo ) is slightly brighter on the left hand side with an almost invisible line that goes vertically from the top to the bottom of the screen dividing the tv in 2 parts ( brighter and darker ) .
even though this is almost invisible i found it inacceptable in a screen of this quality .
now i have a 5 years warranty and i 'm pretty sure that i did n't caused the problem burning the screen ( i never played anything with this weird half screen shape ) .
i 've tried to call the panasonic uk support all day today and it 's always super busy so i 'm thinking to go to my retail shop and talk with them about the problem .
do you know if this is a known issue ?
could it be related to the cyclone mkv 2 player giving an incorrect output ?
any clues ?
suggestions ?
this panel is so incredibly expensive and the only thought of having bought a faulty product is freaking me out .
many thanks in advance for your help guys !
