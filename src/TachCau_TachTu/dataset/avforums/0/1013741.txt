budget 51 " screen .
okay so the 46 " st30 is probably going back ( fan noise & also black level is n't what i wanted ) but can not find a decent alternative in the same / similar price range with the specs etc so i was thinking of going for a budget model instead seen this samsung ps51d495 | 51 inch 3d plasma tv hd ready freeview hd | richer sounds just wondering if anyone has one , know anything about it ?
its only hd ready but i sit about 10 feet away and after having 3d i really want this sort of size screen ( 46 " to 51 " ) similar models in the us get good reviews but i 'm hesitant after reading reviews cos the st30 was not at all what i expected after reading them not one mentions fan noise
