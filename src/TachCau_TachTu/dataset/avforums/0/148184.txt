panasonic vt30 & broken glasses .
hi all just bought a new vt and one of glasses that came with the tv are dead model number ( ty - ew3d2ma ) .
i will contact the local retailer tomorrow and to see if they can change the glasses for me .
are these glasses the newer modles that panasonic have or are they newer one out ther on the market that i should be pushing for ?
thanks
