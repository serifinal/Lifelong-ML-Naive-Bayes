panasonic px60 settings thread .
seeing as the owners thread is getting long , and addressing a wide variety of issues , i thought it might be useful to start a dedicated settings thread .
for example , what settings are people using to run in the set to avoid ( hopefully ) potential screen burn problems later .
the only changes i made to the out of the box settings ( for the run - in ) were - dynamic mode off - turned down contrast to mid way .
- everything else was mid way out of the box .
any suggestions for settings ?
also , i notice there is n't an accurate numerical counter for settings , just a bar .
i guess this makes it a bit harder to share settings .
( or am i missing something ) so , what settings are you using ?
