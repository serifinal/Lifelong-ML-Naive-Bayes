panasonic txp42gt20b tv wont play videos from an hdc - sd700 camcorder ( using sd card ) .
hi , i 've just bought a panasonic tx - p42gt20b ( bargain from harvey norman ) .
its a 2010 model but still a great tv .
well apart from the problem that i 'm having and its so so annoying , and the only major disappointment this far with it ... and thats it wont play videos recorded by my panasonic hdc - sd700 camcorder ( also 2010 model ) .
the camcorder uses sd cards and when i insert any of sd cards into the tv and go to the media player , choose video i get the error message " no valid file to play " .
the weird thing is that my dad has a slightly older panansonic tv and inserting the same sd card in his works just fine - it can play all the video content no problem from the sd card direct .
i 've recorded at 1080 / 50p .
other things i 've tried : - it can read jpgs ( whoopy do !! )
- i 've tried putting the sd card into a usb reader - same result - i 've updated the firmware on the tv to 2.810 - still no joy - connecting the camcorder to the tv via hdmi works fine - but thats not the solution i 'm after .
does anyone have any other suggestions ( other than doing conversions etc on the file ) , i just cant believe that these 2 panasonic products arent compatible .
the official documentation reads like it supports the file format and thats not even starting about so called ' viera link ' compatibility .
so maybe its a fault with the tv ??
any ideas / suggestions would be so welcome .
thx carrie
