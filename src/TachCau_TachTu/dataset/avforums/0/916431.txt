panasonic th42px60b - switching on / off .
my th42px60b is coming up to 3 years old and has so far been very well - behaved .
this week my ailing thomson sky + hd box was replaced with a new amstrad ; the pana has since started to go into a regular switching on and off cycle in freeview mode though the problem seems to resolve itself when i switch the sky box on ( from standby ) .
it seems too much of a coincidence ... any thoughts , similar experiences ?
