calibration via usb ? .
hi all , just got my panasonic gt30 and am giving it a 150 hour run in but would like to calibrate it after .
i know there are a couple of good dvds out there but i do n't actually have a dvd player believe it or not !
are there any options out there like a video file that could be played off usb or a set of image slides and accompanying pdf guide to follow ?
just want a non-dvd solution thanks russ
