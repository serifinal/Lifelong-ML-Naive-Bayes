samsung psxxd8000 buzz !! .
just got my ps58c7000 exchanged with a ps59d8000 due to the 3d crosstalk and glasses losing sync .
pq is fantastic with great motion , better blacks and improved 3d .
i am really happy with the set except on around the 2nd or 3rd day of viewing i have noticed a fairly loud buzz from the set .
i know from having plasma 's before that there is usually a slight hum and i did have a slight buzz on the c7000 but it usually went whisper quiet after a bit of viewing .
it was n't even enough to bother me when it was buzzing .
but ... the level of the buzz on this new set is pretty irratating even with the volume up .
i ca n't see myself getting used to it as unless your pretty much listening to a loud concert or something , you hear the buzz in the background the whole time .
i obviously have all my sound running through my amp and the buzz is coming straight from the back of the set .
does anyone have any experience with having the buzz on any samsung palsma 's fixed ?
2011 series or earlier ?
i remember seeing people saying a new power cable fixed it , or tightening screws in the back of the panel which were vibrating causing the buzz .
others have said the whole panel needed to be changed out .
anyone with anything to add would be much appreciated as it really seems to be a lottery getting a samsung plasma when it comes to buzzing , bad banding etc. .
