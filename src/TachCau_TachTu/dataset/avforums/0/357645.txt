panasonic th42px600 plasma - vertical line on screen .
hi .
i have a 42 '' panasonic plasma which is displaying a vertical line of about 3-4mm right down the middle of the screen .
i do n't think it 's screen burn as it 's a line and not an image .
does anyone have any experience of this ?
i 've been told it 's not a connection/signal issue as it still appears when i watch a dvd .
the tv is less than 18 months old .
any advice/suggestions would be appreciated .
thanks !
