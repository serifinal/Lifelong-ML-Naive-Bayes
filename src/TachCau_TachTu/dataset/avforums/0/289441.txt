deep colour - on or off on my samsung plasma .
hi , i am hoping someone here can help .
my tv ( samsung c680 ) a nasty habit of showing dithering , fuzzy pixels on dark areas of the picture and on lighter areas at times of textures like walls , doors anything it can be .
this happens on blurays .
my source is a ps3 and c5900 samsung3d blu player ... they are both connected using the newest sony hdmi with high speed , ethernet , arc etc. . .
so they are very good cables .
i figured it could have been a deep colour issue after doin extensive research so i turned this setting off in both the ps3 and bluray player and itactually improved the dithering of the pixels .
but now i am getting alot of banding / false contouring / gradiatio n so my question is can this now be fixed by tweaking anything else settings-wise ?
i assume i am getting this as the deep colour has lowered the bit depth the colour ?!
... i am not happy i get either of these problems ... is there no happy / medium ?!
... would changing the gamma / brightness / contrast / colour settings on my tv help remove the banding / posturization i am getting ?
... .
please help , thankyou .
