panasonic tx - p50v10b - black has turned grey ? .
hi guys , my mate has had he 's tx - p50v10b since it was released in summer 2009 and there is something really wrong with he 's tv .
he 's tv is unable to display any shade of black at all !
i am by no means exaggerating here but he 's pq on that once a great plasma tv is worse than an entry level lcd .
there is sooo much brightness or some form of light all around the screen .
anything that 's supposed to be black is grey .
i tried lowering the brightness control so much i actually turned it off completely and the tv still could n't display black .
it was just a big grey mess .
normally if you turn off the brightness completely , you would struggle to see anything right ?
not on this set .
there is no such thing as black on this tv .
i 'll try and take some pictures if i go down to he 's place tonight .
i read about the black level / mll rise on this particular set and i strongly believe this set has been affected real bad .
my mate who owns it and knows absolutely nothing about tv 's noticed it and called me over to come look at it .
is there anything he can do ?
he did get the 5 year panasonic warranty when he bought the set ?
i feel really sorry for him , the tv is a total waste and unwatchable !!
