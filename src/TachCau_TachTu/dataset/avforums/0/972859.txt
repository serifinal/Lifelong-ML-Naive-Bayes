panasonic p42g20b failed at 14 months .
large black vertical bar left quarter of screen 1 day ago , now no picture , just red led flashes 7 times , pause , 7 times again , etc , etc. ... retailer - amazon - say speak to panasonic first , so i did , after they ignored my email .
premium rate phone number , totally arrogant and want me to pay for it to be " assessed " and only if i take it to a " service centre " nearly 30 miles away .
i have never come across such appalling customer support but , as he said , it 's outside 12 months warranty ( by less than two months ) so " tough " .
i 'm waiting for amazon to get back to me again , hopefully they will have more respect for the current eu rules on " warranty " of electrical goods .
lesson , never buy panasonic .
