please help me ! .
i very stupidly cleaned my lg 50 " plasma screen with an oven cleaner fluid , and now i have smudges and traces of fluid that seem to be engraved in the screen .
it seems to have seeped right through as i ca n't remove them .
i know it was stupid now , but i just did n't know at the time !
i bought it second hand and it did n't come with a manual , and now i feel so annoyed and terribly frustrated .
is there anything i can do to repair this ?
any help / advice would be tremendously appreciated .
thank you .
holly
