has anybody got a trouble free v20 ? .
mine is away at the service centre due to the buzzing problem - about to get the power supply is getting replaced under the panny warranty .
the guys at the centre arent very confident that this will solve the problem though .
got me thinking , has anybody actually got a v20 that has no issues ?
and am i wasting my time in trying to get the buzzing sorted ?
i 've only had the set about 5 weeks and two of them it has spent at the service place - so i can still return it if i want .
