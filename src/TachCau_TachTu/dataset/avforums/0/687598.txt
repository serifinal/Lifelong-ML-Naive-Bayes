panasonic plasma tv tx-p50u30 - problem .
my problem is that when showing a video and selecting 4x3 aspect or when an old movie is shown on a tv chanel and is shown as 4x3 the unused sides of the tv screen is displayed as light grey which is very distracting .
every other tv i have shows the unused sides as black .
i am almost sure when i first bought this plasma tv it did show the sides as black .
i ca n't find any reference to this in the manual nor in the menu of the tv .
can this colour at the sides be changed back to black , and if so how .
the tv set is only a month old and everything else is fine .
any help will be most welcome .
