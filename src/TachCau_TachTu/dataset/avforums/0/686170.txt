1 plumber , lots of blood sweat and tears , and a few hundred quid later ... .
i do n't post on here very often but i do read a lot , so i thought i 'd contribute to the forum with a guide to how i installed my pioneer 436xde with 5 b&w fpm speakers .
i have never done anything like this before , not really the diy sort , but i thought i 'd give it a go , so i took photos to show you where i went wrong !
hope you find it helpful !!
