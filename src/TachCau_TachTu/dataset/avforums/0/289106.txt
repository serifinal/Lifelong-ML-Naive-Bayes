panasonic vt30 fan noise .
i want to ascertain if i 've actually got a problem with the fan ( s ) on my 42vt30 or do they all sound this way .
for the first month or so i could hear the fans but they simply made a faint " wooshing " sound that was n't that intrusive , certainly i could n't hear it over the fans on my sky + hd box .
for some reason over the last few weeks the sound has changed to more of a higher pitch " whirring " sound that can be heard over the tv sound for anything less than 50 % volume .
i can also hear the noise pulsing , presumeably when the fans get out of synch with each other .
it 's beginning to get quite annoying .
fyi , this is not related to the buzzing or crickets issue .
