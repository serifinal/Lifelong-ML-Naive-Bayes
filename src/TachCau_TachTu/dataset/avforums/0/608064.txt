samsung tv and dvd combo sound issue .
hi there , hopefully i have posted this on the right forum .
i friend of mine purchased a samsung ps42c450 tv and ht - d5500 blu ray dvd player and surround sound system as a combo from curries for christmas , which i have tried to setup for him .
the blu ray player is connected to the tv via a 1.4 hdmi cable .
the sky box is connected to the tv via the blu ray player with 2 x 1.4 hdmi cables .
this is as per samsungs instructions .
the dvd player works fine , however i can not get the tv to work correctly with the sky box .
when he turns the telly and sky box on , the picture is shown for a couple of seconds , but then he gets the following error message .
&#8220; connect an optical cable from this product to an external digital device such as a cable box or satellite receiver &#8221; with or without an optical cable connected between the sky box and the bru ray dvd the tv then defaults to av1 ( which isn &#8217; t in use ) you then have to go to the menu then cycle through the inputs manually until you reach av4 at which point everything , including the sound works fine .
i tried connecting the sky box directly to the tv via hdmi and this stops the error message being displayed , but , as the surround sound it integrated with the blu ray player this is not a workable solution .
does anyone have a setup similar to this and know how to solve the problem , i assume he needs to set an audio default on the tv to none optical , but i ca n't find any such setting .
i would appreciate any suggestions .
thanks kris
