problems streaming to panny .
hi all just setup my pc to be connected to my 42gt20b using ps3media server .
divx files will stream without a hitch but as sonn as i try mkv files it just wont read them .
i have converted the files already to remove the dts audio as this was supposed to cause problems but all to no avail .
the bizarre thing is the very first time i tried to stream kung fu panda over the wireless network it started but was choppy so i stopped and hard wired the pc to the network and now it wont play the file at all .
it clearly states in the manual that the tv will stream mkv files so where am i going wrong ???
