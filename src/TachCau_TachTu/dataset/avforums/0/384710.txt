panasonic pv500 buzz unacceptable .
i went to see the pv500cab in currys today with a view of getting one .
i have been put off because it has a very loud buzz coming from the rear .
the pioneer had less but the philips was awful .
the 50 '' panasonic -lrb- had a 30 in the model -rrb- had less buzz than the pv500 .
noise is a problem for me .
i hate any noise that should n't be there .
i do n't think the pv500 is an option now
