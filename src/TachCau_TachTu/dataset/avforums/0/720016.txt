connecting sammy ps50c680 to ps3 for 3d .
hi there .
for some reason i can not unlock any 3d modes on the tv .
i only have the crappy tv 3d conversion which is terrible .
has anyone set-up their ps3 to run 3d content ?
please help if possible .
samsung tech support are impossible to get hold of .
i have the latest firmware upgrade on ps3 .
thanks in advance .
