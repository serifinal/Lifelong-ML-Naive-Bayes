panasonic th42pz80 pc connection missing .
trying to help a friend connect his laptop to a panasonic plasma tv th42pz80 .
we used an standard analogue " sub-d " cable used to connect pc monitors to pc 's .
this was plugged into the socket marked pc on the back of the tv .
from the remote we pressed " av " and a list of av connections was displayed .
the manual states that there should be an entry entitled " pc " , but there was n't ( ? )
needless to say we could not display the laptop screen on the tv .
the " hdmi3 " connection was also missing from the list despite there being a socket so marked .
tried different power up sequences ( tv - laptop ; laptop - pc ) but to no avail .
i have used this type of cable to connect laptops and pc 's to sony tv 's via the sub-d connector and they worked fine first time .
any thoughts ?
does your th42pz80 show a pc connection on the av list ?
