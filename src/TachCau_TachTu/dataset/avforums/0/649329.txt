should my plasma be doing this ?! .
hi , after issues with lcd tv 's , i made the switch to plasma .
everything was fine ( bar a few phosphor trails on certain things ) and then i started getting some xbox 360 time in .
been playing rdr recently and have now noticed that whenever i pan the camera around , the background , erm ... ghosts ?
best way to describe it is the picture ca n't keep up when i pan around .
it almost looks like i 'm looking at a 3d picture without 3d glasses on .
everything goes blurry .
if i pan slowly , it 's fine .
as soon as i pan quickly , it becomes an issue , so it 's a nightmare in fps games at the moment .
was playing mass effect 2 last night and with a couple of characters on the screen , when i was panning the camera , it looked as if the characters had doubled up .
i can try and film it if people do n't know what i 'm talking about , lol .
