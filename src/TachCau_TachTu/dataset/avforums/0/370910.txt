anyone know anything about the panasonic tx-p50gw30 ? .
hi , i live in germany and after weeks of umming and rrring about which tv to get i had decided on the tx-p50g30b .
but , i could n't find it on the panasonic.de site or in many other places for that matter .
they do however have the tx-p50gw30 which seems quite similar .
anyone know if this is similar/better/worse ?
many thanks
