th - 42pz70ba .
hi .
i have a panasonic plasma th - 42pz70ba which had developed a fault , but is now repaired by myself , but i need the latest firmware to stop the fault returning !
it 's a known fault .
7 blinks .
i have replaced the transistor on the scan board and the tv is working fine but i need a firmware upgrade .
i contacted panasonic but they do nt provide the firmware to the public .
any help would be greatly appreciated , tia .
