artifacts / screen noise on samsung plasma ? .
i have a samsung hpr5012x / xaa 50 " plasma tv .
i got this tv from a friend , it had no picture but it did have sound so i figured it was worth trying to fix .
so , here i am now .
i replaced the y - sustain board , which my friend bought but never put in , as well as the lower buffer board which had a short in one of the chips and you could see where it had blown out .
i now have a picture but it has horizontal lines of artifacts as you can see in the picture .
my question is whether i should first try replacing the x-sustain board or the logic board next ?
the picture is below
