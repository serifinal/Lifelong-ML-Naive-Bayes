latest firmware for panny s10 ? .
i 'm on my second panny s10 - first had lots of pixel defects - that was at software version 1209 .
my replacement is at software version 1208 .
not sure if this is the firmware version being reported .
my current set has less colour banding than the " later " model ( based on serial no ) but still too much imho , especially on standard def from dvb - s ( satellite ) .
what is the most current software / firmware version for this model ?
has the colour banding problem ( as reported by which ) been resolved or not ?
