pioneer pdp lx6090 has stopped displaying . . .
hi after just over 2 years and within 3 weeks of our digital switch over my pioneer pdp lx6090 has stopped displaying digital channels .
the channels which have a strong signal come up with the error ' this channel is not in service ' the epg is populated , the analogue service works properly and all the scart and hdmi inputs work correctly .
i have not touched any settings but could something of happened with an automatic update .
the reason for this posting is has anybody else had this problem ?
i 'm not to concerned has i 'm still covered by a 5 year warranty .
has anybody had to call on this cover .
