help !!!
just bought a tv but i dont have an aerial ?!
read this if you want to laugh .
hi guys ok - so i have just splashed out on a lovely panny p50gt30 not had a tv here before so i was very much looking forward to it !
however - on trying to connect it to the aerial cables i had in the flat -lrb- which were here when i started renting a couple of months back ... -rrb- i have just noticed a little sign saying `` virgin '' on them ... .
so i can only assume that the previous tennants had virgin installed .
i assume there is no way to adapt the output from the virgin cable to allow it to enter my tv ?
also - i just so happen to have an old virgin media box lying around which i removed from my old house .
will plugging this in allow me to access the basic tv channels ?
help !
i wan na watch my new tv lol im such a muppet !!!!
