panasonic vt30 buzzing question ? .
those of you with buzzing sets , is your tv wall mounted ?
those of you without a buzz , is your tv stand mounted ?
i only have until tomorrow to decided if i want to return my tv to the suppliers for a refund ( 28 days after purchase ) .
they do n't have anymore in stock and wo n't be getting anymore , so a swap out is not an option .
i 've spoken to a panasonic service centre who advised that they have solved the buzzing on a number of these units that were walled mounted , by fitting a small spacer between the bracket and the tv , something like a plastic washer .
not in all cases has this solved the problem , but with quite a few .
i 'm going to try it tonight on my 55vt30 and will let you know the outcome .
has anyone tried this already with or without success ?
thanks .
