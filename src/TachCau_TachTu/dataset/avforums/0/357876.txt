help me get the best out of new 50 " panasonic plasma .
hi , can somene please advise everything i should be doing to get the best out of my plasma ?
i have had a p50st30 for about two weeks , but only got around to hooking it up yesterday .
i know about the ' green tinge ' issue , and straight out of the box i am seeing the ' green tinge ' and also some ' pink tinge ' .
i have done nothing to this set as far as setting it up , just switched on and watching stuff in normal mode .
i just have basic sky at the moment hooked up via a scart lead , and the picture is n't all that great - not the best detail , colour a bit too red , when faces move on the screen they very briefly lose definition and but look ok when not moving .
is the lack of high def material causing any of these problems ?
just after some advice really ( new to plasmas and high def ... etc ) , mainly for the green tinge which is very evident ( i know there is meant to be a f / w fix , but can i do anything first to try and improve my viewing ? )
i do nt have blu ray player so cant test films yet .
thanks .
