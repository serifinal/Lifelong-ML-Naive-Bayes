how to connect panasonic th - 42pw3 plasma to thomson dv3 digital terrestrial recorder ? .
how do i connect my panasonic th - 42pw3 plasma television directly to my thomson dv3 digital terrestrial recorder ?
i have an old th - 42pw3 plasma but the tuner / receiver that comes with it is not working very well .
is there a way to plug my thomson dv3 digital terrestrial recorder directly into the th - 42pw3 without going through the tuner / receiver box ?
the dv3 only has scart out and s - video .
the th - 42pw3 has the following : av in : i tried going in through this using a scart to rca ( yellow , red , white ) adapter but it did not work .
i tried s - video but quality was very poor .
component / rgb in : i have not tried this yet pc in : i bought a cheap ( Â£ 2 from ebay ) scart to pc lead as a cheap punt but it did not work .
did i have the wrong lead or is this not possible as the quality of my xbox 360 through the pc in is great .
tuner in : i guess this is just for the tuner only serial : i 'm not sure what this is for here is a link to the user manual for the tv : http://www.canong3.co.uk/tv/42pw3.pdf what would be the best quality connection ?
if you have a link to the exact lead i need that would really help .
thanks , daryl
