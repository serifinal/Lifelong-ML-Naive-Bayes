help needed with new plasma screen . .
hi , yesterday recieved my new plasma screen a techwood 42 '' job from curries .
tested it with dvd and it looks fantastic , plugged in sky + and video , video is ok .
sky + i 'm having a nightmare with , some channels are lovely , others are really badly blocky , especially on grey 's / black 's .
is this a general issue with plasma screens or is something wrong ?
and does anyone know the sky + remote code for controlling the tv with the sky + remote ?
thanks
