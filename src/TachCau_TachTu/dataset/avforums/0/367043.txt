my samsung ps50c680g5kxxu has died after 6 months .
just sharing my experience .
my samsung 3d ps50c680g5kxxu has died after 6 months - sound , no picture , responds to remote , meaning the y - sus or z - sus boards have blown .
dixons has asked to talk to samsung , and samsung to dixons - would obviously get repaired until 1 year is over .
Â£ 1,000 3d tv for 1 year , with no hope after - avoid , and buy a sony or panasonic - most importantly , buy with extended warranty !!!
