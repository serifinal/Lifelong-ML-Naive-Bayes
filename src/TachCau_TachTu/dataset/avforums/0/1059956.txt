long long time ago i bought a pw5 .
s per the above i have a pw5 with only one components input , which i use for apple tv 1 .
now i 'm getting multi room installed and hd in my bedroom where this tv is , does anyone know how hdmi to vga is i know it 's not true hd but i think i should be able to get a better picture than scary to vga .
so does anyone have a converter ??
any experience where can i get a cheap one and finally would a standard hdmi to vga work ??
not a powered one
