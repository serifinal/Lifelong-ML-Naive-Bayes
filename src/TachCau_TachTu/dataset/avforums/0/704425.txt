burned image problem .
hello , my first post here .
few months ago i bought my first plasma tv ( lg pk760 ) .
i knew that i had to be careful about static images , because they could be burned into the screen but i totally forgot about the black line on top ( and bottom ) of the screen that 80 % channels that i watch have .
now that place has become " lighter " than the rest of the screen , which is visible when watching fullscreen channels or playing playstation .
right now it does n't bother me much , since you only see it if you focus on it , but i 'm worried that after more time it will become more and more visible ( if just 3 months is enough for this kind of damage ) i 'm guessing there 's nothing i can do to fix that but would like to know how do other plasma users avoid getting this and what should i do to not damage my screen any further ?
i do n't think i 've been using tv too exessively , but there were a few times when it 's been turned on for whole day - i 'm now guessing this is the main reason i just did n't think it could be this bad ... thanks for the answers and sorry for my bad english .
