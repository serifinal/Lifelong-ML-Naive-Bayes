ps51d530 service menu .
hi to all !
i ´ m sorry for asking maybe a dump question but i ´ m out of any ideas now .
please , help me how to activate service menu in my samsung ps51d530 plasma tv .
pressing info-menu-mute-power on remote when tv is in standby is not working for me .
maybe i ´ m doing something wrong but i have no idea what that could be .
thank you very much !
