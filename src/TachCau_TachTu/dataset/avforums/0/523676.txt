panasonic flicker .
do all panasonics flicker ?
even the vt models at 96hz ?
i guess the reason they flicker is because they run pal50 @ 50hz and 24p @ 48hz ?
except for the vt models which can run 24p @ 96hz ... am i correct about this or do all panasonics have the flicker ?
also am i correct in thinking that only the vt models can do 24p / 96hz and pal50 / 100hz ?
