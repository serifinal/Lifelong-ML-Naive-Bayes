breaking in my new plasma .
i just got a panasonic tcp42s30 .
how do i calibrate this ?
right now i have it set to : picture mode : cinema contrast : +50 brightness : +50 color : +50 tint : 0 sharpness : +50 should i have things set lower / higher ?
i 'm trying to ease into this plasma ... would hate to get some image retention / burn in after i just got it .
