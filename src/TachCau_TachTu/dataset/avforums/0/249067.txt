panasonic p50vt20b gaming issue .
hi , has anyone got any comments on gaming lag when using xbox 360 with this model of tv ?
reason i ask is i 've just got the 50 '' version p50vt20b of this tv and although all reviews i had read say there is almost no game lag i am experiencing terrible gaming lag so much so that its almost impossible to play games online such as cod .
before anyone asks about my broadband , etc , etc. .
i am benchmarking against my existing panasonic tv -lrb- 46pz80ba -rrb- which i have had for years using that tv i have no problems whatsoever .
plug my new tv in and the gaming lag is giving me a headache .
i 've got the tv connected to the internet and upgraded to the latest firmware , set the xbox input to ` game ' in the video settings .
what else can i try or has anyone else noticed the same ?
thanks
