panasonic 42vt20 settings .
hello everyone , recently got myself one of these and was wondering if anyone had some calibrated settings i could put onto the set ?
i know thx mode is meant to look really good but for some reason when watching sky -lrb- not tried blu ray -rrb- i got a thin blue bar on the right hand edge of the screen going top to bottom .
been using the cinema settings but i 'm not sure if they are the best as i 'm sure i 'm seeing a little ghosting on movement .
-lrb- not sure if thats because the screen is brand new or not .
first plasma and i heard they need to be warmed in -rrb-
