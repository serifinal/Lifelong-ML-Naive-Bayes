brightness fluctuation on my samsung plasma tv - please help ! .
hi , last night i discovered a really bizzare occurance and im concerned about my tv .
basically i had on my plasma tv , bluray player and hd dvd player ... i put in happy feet hd dvd to play and noticed 4mins in on a very dark scene that the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen were fluctuating in brightness !
i havent ever noticed this before however i have had a nasty time of setting my settings as i would like them for awhile now and i wonder if this has been the problem as too why ?! . .
it appeared when the screen went brighter the black bars settled down -lrb- although it could just be my eyes -rrb- but on a darkscene it definatly was almost like a black level dip up and down all over the bars .
is there anything that could likely be a cause for this ?!
... is it a voltage or cable issue ?! . .
i tried resetting settings all back to default and that made no difference ... for the record , i am not using cinema smooth either !
its turned off , so it must be something else causing this ?!
please help anyone , as im quite confused and concerned over this .
thankyou .
