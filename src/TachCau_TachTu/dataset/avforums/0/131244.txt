problem with picture quality ( graininess ) from hdmi & component input , lg 42pq2000 .
hello everyone , please forgive me if my explanation is not that clear or if i do n't use the correct terminology - i 'm a relative newbie to this av world !
i have a lg 42pq2000 , which i 've had for about 2 years , and recently have been having a problem with picture quality .
the picture coming from the aerial / freeview is fine , no probs with that .
the picture quality on the component input from my xbox360 used to be fine , but a couple of months ago it started to get really grainy , more so on some light / bright colours .
to clarify , the white background on the xbox ' dashboard ' / homepage is ' grain ' free - but should i play a game / dvd and there 's an explosion , bright sky or sunrise for example , the brightest parts of the picture go really grainy .
sometimes it 's worse than other times - it 's fairly inconsistent regarding the level of graininess .
hoping it might just be the xbox or component cable , i bought a blu ray player and hdmi cable ( which i tested on another tv , both worked fine ) - only to find the same problem , but this time it was obviously happening on the hdmi input channels ( i tried them all ) .
so to summarise : aerial = fine , hdmi & component = grainy .
have any of you wise souls experienced this problem with a plasma tv before or know what the problem / solution may be ?
i 'd be extremely grateful for any help / advice , thanks !
