panasonic 2011 range - hdmi ethernet .
does the new range implement hdmi ethernet ?
the current situation is . .
1x ethernet cable to bd palyer ( bd live and / or skype ) 1x ethernet cable to tv ( vierra connect ) 1x ethernet to my amp for internet radio would be nice ( dare i say desirable ) to use only 1x ethernet connection then let hdmi take care of the rest .
audio return channel is it possible to connect a 3d bd palyer hdmi 1.4 to the tv ( for best picture quality , bypassing the amp 's picture processing , then using the audio return channel send bitstream / lpcm full hd surround sound to the amp ?
lpcm would be handy for older amps .
currently , a dual hdmi 3d bd player is required for this ( 1x hdmi cable to the tv and 1x hdmi cable to the amp ( lpcm ) when the amp cant decode hd bitstreams .
suround audio ( arc ) has this been sorted ?
from 1st of april , all tvs must have an encoder / decoder to send surround sound ( freeview hd ) as dts to the amp ( not dolby pulse and mixed codecs required for audio description ) .
2010 range could not do this , all had was stereo .
thanks bill
