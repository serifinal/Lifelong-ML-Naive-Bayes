disappointing john lewis tv delivery service .
i 've ordered samsung ps59d6900 from john lewis a week a ago .
i could have bought somewhere else and would have received much earlier but i think the customer service with jl is worthy the one week wait .
the delivery was scheduled 2 pm to 9 pm today .
i had to take one day off to wait for the delivery at home .
called jl customer service around lunch time to make sure they will deliver today and they said ok but ca n't give a estimated time .
call them again around 4 pm and the message i got was still positive and would be delivered today but still ca n't give me a time .
i waited patiently till 8:30 pm and finally got a phone call from the driver and told me they ca n't make it today .
i was so disappointed .
even then , they could have done a lot of things to make things better .
1 ) if jl knows i am on the bottom of your deliver list , why do n't you tell me earlier so that i did n't have to take the whole day off and waited at home for nothing .
2 ) why do n't you offer me a delivery slot straight away the next day if you ca n't make it for today ?
now i probably need to wait for another delivery slot which may be a week away .
the party i organised at home for the bank holiday weekend will just become a joke without the tv .
i need to at least take another day off to wait for the delivery at home without doing anything wrong .
how ridiculous is that !
i may cancel the order and get it from somewhere else .
think carefully before ordering for john lewis .
they do no longer offer the premium service as they used to do .
