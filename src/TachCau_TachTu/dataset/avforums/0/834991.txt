viera high pitch buzzing / squeal .
i have a panasonic viera tx - p42u30b and ever since i turned it on there has been a high pitch buzzing almost a squeal .
the only time you do n't hear it is when the volume is loud enough to drown it out .
it is becoming the only thing i hear because it is annoying me so much .
what is it ?
