screen burn .
my panasonic tx - p50g20b is about 1 year old now , i watch a lot of blu rays and dvd 's on it using ' cinema ' mode with the contrast defaulting at about 75 % .
i 've never used dynamic mode after reading the high contrast can burn the screen easier .
however over the christmas period i had a particularly lengthy stint on assassins creed revelations on the ps3 , only to discover to my horror that the life bar has burnt my tv in the top left .
now i 've read all the bits n pieces on the web saying that plasma burn has virtually been eradicated from new tv 's but i can assure you it has not !
so my question now is does anyone know a good method to remove the burn or try to reverse it ?
thanks
