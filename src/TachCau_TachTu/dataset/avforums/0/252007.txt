has anyone seen this problem before - panasonic pz80 .
hi .
my plasma is just over a year old and it 's suddenly encountered a drastic colour change problem where the black colour has changed to red .
i 've rang up the warranty company , curry 's whateverhappens ( before you ask , i bought it from there because it was a very good price at the time ! )
who said they re going to take the tv away for 2 - 3 weeks !
so i was just wondering if anyone knows a fix before it gets sent away .
