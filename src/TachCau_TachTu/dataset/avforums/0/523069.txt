tx - p46gt30b - only 3d when i stand up ? .
i 've just got my new panny tx - p46gt30b out of the box popped resident evil afterlife into my lg 3d bluray player and discovered that i can only watch the film in 3d if i stand up ... my normal viewing position is 3m from the screen and my head would come dead centre of the screen height wise .
if i stand up the image clicks into 3d mode .
if i then sit down , that mode is retained for about 5 seconds and then the image blurs and 3d is lost .
i get the same effect with sky 3d too .
i 'm using panny 's ty - ew3d2me glasses .
i have even tried propping up the rear of the tv stand with a couple of drinks coasters to simulate a greater viewing elevation , but that did n't give me a seated 3d image .
any thoughts ?
thanks
