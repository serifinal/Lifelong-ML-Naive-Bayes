samsung c series - brightness dip problem .
hello !
im after a bit of help , can anyone explain or fix the issue i am getting ?!
basically , when i play a bluray , movie , game , if i set the brightness under 50 on a scene in a movie that fades to blackness or the screen goes completely black then the screen just turns off !
it comes back when the next scene starts or say ive just finished a multiplayer game on cod on my ps3 the screen will go black and shut off until im back at the lobby screen .
this may seem an unannoying feature to some but when you are trying to watch a movie and you get these intervals of darkness its like someone has hit the tv off button accidentaly !
is this really samsungs idea of a pleasurable viewing experience ?!
lol ... i guess it would n't be so bad if the black levels were better and being above 50 was fine for standard mode but sadly this isnt overly the case .
id like to add no image enhancements are on !
no energy eco saver settings are enabled !
also it can happen in any of the 3 available modes ( movie , standard or dynamic ) so what causes this phenomenon ?!
... on a side note , i managed to unlock custom colour space today via the service menu on my tv - if anyone is curious it just needs the colourspace support changed from huesat type to rgb type thanks !
