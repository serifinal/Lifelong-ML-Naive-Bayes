panasonic tvs ` red light of death ' ! .
i have a panasonic plasma tv tx-p42g10b which i purchased from currys on 29th august 2009 which makes it under 2 years old .
recently the tv started to switch itself off .
on trying to turn it back on again either from the power button or the remote sometimes it will turn on for a while and then turn off .
other times it is trying to turn on with the red light flashing but not turning to green and the tv on .
i now have currys coming out to look at it next thursday 21st july 2011 .
i have told them that i have googled this particular fault and it is a well known one in most panasonic plasma tvs -lrb- tx range particularly -rrb- both here in the uk plus america .
this fault is apparantly know as `` the red light of death '' and seems to be a fault in the power supply to the inner workings of the tv .
