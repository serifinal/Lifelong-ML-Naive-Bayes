can anyone help me with my tuner for the thomson wysius ?? .
help !!!!! im so dumb when it comes to my tv i dont even know the right terminology to use to describe what is happening !
bear with me - i think its an easy one .
i bought a thomson 42wb02/3s about two years ago and it worked great until the other week .
now the plasma screen itself seems fine but the tuner box thing that plugs into it just constantly has a red light on the front .
if i press the remote control it just seems to randomly flash the red light on the front of the tuner box but nothing happens .
normally when it works this red light is a steady green .
if i turn it all off then on again i get a steady red light until i use the remote then it randomly flashes again .
any ideas ?
anyone that can help will get a huge from me !!
