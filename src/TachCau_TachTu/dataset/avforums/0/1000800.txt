panasonic plasma screen problem th - 42px60b .
hello , i have a panasonic th - 42px60b that has developed a 3 inch vertical black line right in the centre of the screen ?
the line appears whatever i watch ( tv , dvd , cable ) and a can not seem to get rid of the line .
i have disconnected and reconnected all cables but no luck .
does anyone have any idea what the problem could be ?
any advice would be greatly appreciated .
thanks .
