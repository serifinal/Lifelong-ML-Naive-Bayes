panasonic tx - p50vt20 picture settings .
i 've had the tx - p50vt20l model for almost 18 months and i 'm still in search of picture settings that i 'll be happy with .
unfortunately , i 've been using the dynamic mode from the outset , so whenever i try to change to any recommended settings , i convince myself that the loss in overall brightness is decreasing the pq .
i 've even set sharpness and p - nr to max despite reading how ill - advised that is .
i would be grateful for any advice regarding this issue .
i am utterly clueless when it comes to calibration .
