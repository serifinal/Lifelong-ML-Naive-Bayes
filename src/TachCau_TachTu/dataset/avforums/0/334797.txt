arc problem with panasonic vt30 .
dear all , i have a panasonic p55vt30 plasma tv connected to a yamaha rx - v571 amp via hdmi .
i have a focal dome 2.1 system connected to the amp .
i have a sky + box plugged into the amp 's hdmi input 1 .
everything works perfectly - the sky picture appears on the tv , the sound comes out the speakers connected to the amp ... no problem .
however , when i go to use the viera 's internet function and access bbc iplayer ( for example ) , the sound comes out of the tv 's speakers which is obviously not what i want .
i have enabled arc on the amp and set the hdmi return input channel to ' av 4 ' .
i know that this is all set up correctly as when i open iplayer using the panasonic remote , the amp automatically switches to av 4 .
i 've made sure that the ' speakers ' setting in the viera link menu is set to ' home theatre ' as opposed to ' tv ' but no sound comes out of the speakers .
the only thing i can think is that the hdmi cable is not 1.4 ( or even 1.3 ) spec and therefore does n't support arc .
the hdmi cable that connects the tv to the amp is channelled into the wall - i 'm living in a new - build apartment and the hdmi cables were already installed as standard spec .
i 'm an av novice ( as you can probably tell from the lingo i 'm using ! )
and would hugely appreciate any advice that could be given .
many thanks in advance !
