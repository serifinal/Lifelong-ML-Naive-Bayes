vlc/ext usb drive on panasonic plasma .
hi , will vlc potable on a external usb 1tb hardive work if connected to panasonic plasma ?
the reason is , that vlc portable is the only plugin that will open .
rec media files/movies , on portable drives/disks etc. .
just wanted to know if this will work or will it have to be a powered hardrive for 1tb disk to work ?
its a real shame panasonics have no built in vlc so you can play any format .
