samsung tv ? .
hi i just bought a 51 " samsung plasma tv model - ps51d550c1m , i am waiting for it to be delivered but i am thinking about changing the tv for another one ... i was browsing through one of the catalogues and i saw the same tv and it says 600hz im assuming thats the power it uses , and i looked at all the other tv 's and they only use about 100hz ... can someone tell me what the hz means ?
does this mean my tv is going to use alot of electricity ?
thanks
