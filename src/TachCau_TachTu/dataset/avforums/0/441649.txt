panasonic tcp50x3 and wireless headphones ? .
i just got this television today as a gift from my parents -lrb- who got it for a great price after spending a certain amount at a store -rrb- and have a question about hooking up wireless headphones .
i do a lot of gaming at night and do n't want to wake up the others in the house , on my smaller tv i had a headphone jack and used that every time it was on .
the panasonic does n't have that option but i figured my wireless headphones would work .
after plugging in the wh into every port imaginable at the back and playing with both the ps3 's settings and the tv 's settings , i could n't get them to work .
am i doing something wrong or does this tv not support that ability ?
since it 's brand new i 'm also not sure about image retention and how much it can be gamed on at one time before settling in .
on my old crt i 'd sometimes wrack up 6-8 hours at a time of halo and it has the map and weapons icons firmly in the bottom .
any advice on how to properly tune this tv would be much appreciated .
i 'm new to plasmas , my only experience with owning a high definition tv is a sony bravia lcd .
thanks .
