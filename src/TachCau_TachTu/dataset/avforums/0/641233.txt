problem with samsung ps50c7000 !?! .
hey guys , ive just bought a new samsung ps50c7000 .
im not sure what i think to it yet as the black levels are pretty grey compared to my 4 year old le40f86 lcd which i thought was pretty odd seeings i allways thought plasma had better blacks ?
just wonder if the black levels will get better after the 200 hour running in period ?
this is my first plasma so not sure whether its a fault or if the blacks should look grey ?
ive played around with the brightness / contrast / cell light etc but to no avail really .
id be really grateful for any input , thanks in advance .
