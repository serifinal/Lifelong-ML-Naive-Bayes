tv repair lg .
my lg ps3000 got the red haze error , best described as being like when back in the day when you had to use a coathanger for an aerial and had a bad picture add to that a red / pink wash to the whole picture .
plus there is a buzzing sound , almost like a fan but certainly louder than what is normal .
anyway engineer reports states ' internal main circuit board ( pcb ) , the sustain z / y pcbs have failed ' .
anyone know how much i can pick up replacements of this type and if i would be able to do the work myself .
i know its a big ask , any advice would be appreciated .
