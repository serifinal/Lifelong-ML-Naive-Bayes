panasonic tx - p46s20ba - unique hdmi xbox 360 connection problem .
hi , i have a xbox 360 however when connecting to the tv i get no signal , if i wiggle it about in the back of the xbox , i get a green picture , and can not get it the correct colour .
now , the problem can not be the xbox , as when connecting it to another samsung tv the hdmi works fine . .
im so confused of this one . .
no one seems to know the answer of my problem . .
anyone have any ideas ?
many thanks wadey
