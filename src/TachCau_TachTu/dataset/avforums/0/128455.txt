connect laptop to panasonic p42ut30b .
hi , can anyone tell me the best way to connect my laptop to my panasonic p42ut30 ?
my laptop only has a vga connection and tv has hdmi , it also has an ethernet port , but not sure if ethernet will only connect to the internet router i see there are vga to hdmi cables and then there 's vga to hdmi converter boxes etc , but it 's all confusing me now , so if someone could help clear things up much appreciated
