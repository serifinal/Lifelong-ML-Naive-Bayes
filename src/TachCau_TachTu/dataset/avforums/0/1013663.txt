pioneer 435xde speakers and hdmi question .
hi , i have a pioneer 435xde plasma that i 'm going to connect up to a new xbox 360 via a hdmi lead to the media box .
all good so far , but what i wanted to know in advance ( since it 's all packed in boxes at mo due to house move ) is will the sound go through the hdmi and come out of the pioneer 's tv speakers ?
i do have a denon amp and some mission surround speakers but no room for those at the moment .
i 'm going to connect a couple of mission speakers direct to the speaker outlets on the back of the tv rather than use the official pio ones for now .
i guess the xbox will just pass sound through the hdmi , and it will come out in stereo ?
i hope .... .
thanks in advance for light people can shed onto this .
neil .
