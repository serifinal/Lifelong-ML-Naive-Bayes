is boost mobile blackberry unlimited with international connect the best plan ? .
i 'm a canadian moving to the us looking for a new phone .
i 've been using a blackberry 9700 with bis and i 'm looking for a plan in the us that offers the following : lots of minutes to canada reasonable local calling bis service ( ~ 100mb of blackberry data ) is boost mobile 's international connect option the best for people wishing to call canada a lot ?
the plan seems great ( $ 70 a month for unlimited everything ) but its painful shelling out $ 200 for a 8330 when i have a perfectly good 9700 .
are there any alternatives ?
i 'm not huge google voice fan , too much of a delay when talking ...
