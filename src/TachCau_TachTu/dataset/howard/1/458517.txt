ditching iphone4 for htc evo .
okay i need some advice here .
i was one of the very first to successfully place the pre-order for the iphone4 .
it was early tuesday morning around 7:45 .
i had zero issues and it all went through in 1 attempt .
it also states on the confirmation that it should arrive around june 24 .
now i have decided i no longer want the iphone4 and will be picking up an evo tomorrow .
i called att to cancel the iphone order and she said it is already processed and possibly en route so she could not cancel it , but that i would just need to refuse shipment or if i receive it , simply ship it back for a full refund .
now to the question : do i refuse shipment ?
or do i list this mfer on ebay for a premium ( 800-1000 ) and when i get the phone just tell att to shove it and charge me the $ 325 cancellation fee ?
can i do this ?
is there any other penalty in doing this ?
like will it affect my credit or anything like that ?
thx
