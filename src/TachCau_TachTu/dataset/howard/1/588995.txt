bell samsung galaxy question .
this is probably a stupid question to ask , but is it possible to get the samsung galaxy on just a voice plan , and no data ?
i use wifi a lot so that would be plenty for me .
i tried it out in store and i really like it , but this is the only thing setting me back .
my contract needs to be renewed soon .
if i ca n't , what 's a good phone on bell that does n't require data ?
