att cs claim they will charge for new mini - sim cards iphone 4 switching micro-sims .
obviously many of us switch gsm phones frequently on howard forums .
easy to slide one mini-sim from one gsm phone and put it in another gsm phone .
however , with the iphone 4 , we are going to have to use a micro sim .
i called att cs up and they say they wo n't provide us with a micro sim adapter to enable us to put the micro sim into a regular gsm phone that only accepts mini-sims .
so i asked if they could supply with with free mini-sims and microsim so everything i switch , i could just call att cs and swap out micro sim numbers for mini sim numbers .
i use currently 4 gsm phones in my monthly rotation .
the new iphone 4 will just become part of my weekly rotation .
this micro-sim that iphone 4 is using is going to cause a lot of headaches for us gsm phone switches .
guess it 's time to go on ebay to start surfing for microsim adapters .
