negotiating with retentions .
hey guys - i know there `s a retention sticky at the top , but just a quick question : from your experiences , is it possible to negotiate successfully with retentions before your contract expires ?
currently , i 'm about 9 months out from the end of my contract and i really want to pick up a bb 9700 before then because my htc touch is crapping out on me .
however , i do n't want to renew without getting some type of bonus .
any thoughts ?
