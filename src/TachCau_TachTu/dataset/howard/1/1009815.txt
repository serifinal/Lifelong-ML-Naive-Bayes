where to buy sealed , factory unlocked phones with warranty ? .
i 'm in need of a new unlocked phone , but i 'm not having much luck finding " just a phone " .
i want an unlocked phone in the sealed , original factory packing , that has never had anything whatsoever to do with any carrier , and has a full manufacturer warranty .
in other words , i want to buy a phone like i buy anything else .
is this even possible ?
i see i can buy that way directly from nokia on their website ( and one aging motorola on theirs ) , but i was hoping to find a retailer with a variety to choose from ( and hopefully some competitive pricing ) .
does anyone know if such a retailer exists ?
or am i stuck with nokia ( which i 'm not too fond of ) ?
thanks !
