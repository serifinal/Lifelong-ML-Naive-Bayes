htc desire / google nexus one and the even more plus 500 talk + text + web plan .
hi howardforums .
i 've been looking for a good phone to upgrade to for awhile now , with a cheap voice + text + data plan .
i 've decided to buy a htc desire or google nexus one to go with this plan .
http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/plans/c...-talk-text-web i have a few questions .
1 ) can i simply buy the unlocked phone and get this plan from the website or store ?
or is it more complicated ?
( more fees and such ) 2 ) can i get this plan for cheaper ?
( with discounts , etc ) 3 ) htc desire or google nexus one ?
thanks .
