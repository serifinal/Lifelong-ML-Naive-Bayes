samsung galaxy s , samsung beam , or se xperia x10 .
i ca n't make up my mind between these three phones .
i love the way that the x10 looks , but i do n't really use facebook or any of those so the whole timescape thing would be a waste .
the beam would be nice b / c i like samsung and the projector would be useful for my kids if they get bored while we 're waiting around somewhere .
plus , the power tends to go out a lot here during storms .
the galaxy s just seems like it will be nice all around .
it looks like a fingerprint magnet , but i love the nice video recording that it does .
i 've never had an android phone before so i do n't think i 'll really know what i 'm missing if i just get 1.6 on the se .
i 'm on at&t , but i do n't care about it not having 3g .
