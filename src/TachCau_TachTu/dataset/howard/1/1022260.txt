using unlocked galaxy s / samsung vibrant without a data plan ? .
hello all , i was thinking about buying a samsung vibrant ( or other android t mobile phone ) until i got some bad news .
i called a tmobile store ( official , not reseller ) in my neighborhood and they said they would n't sell the phone without a data plan .
i thought that was weird so i called tmobile customer service and they told me that the phone would not work at all unless i had a 30 $ data plan .
i do n't really want a data plan because i planned on using wifi ( available in most places i will be using the phone ) for internet access instead .
so my question is , can i buy an unlocked galaxy s and use it on t - mobile ( us ) without a data plan ?
will any problems arise from me going this route ( updates , servicing , etc ) .
thanks
