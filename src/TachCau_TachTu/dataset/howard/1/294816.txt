switching to the pre .
just got the droid when it was released but i still have my eye on the pre plus !
i know the hardware specs are not as good as the droid but i still love it !
is anyone else in the same boat as me ?
i am really considering switching . .
touchstone . .
multitouch . .
portrait keyboard ... more pocket-able . .
looking at one major negative would be going back to : vzw nav
