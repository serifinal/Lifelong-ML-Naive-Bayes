what next for super amoled after galaxy s and wave ? .
i am in no hurry to get a new phone , but i was wondering if there was any good super amoled phones ( samsung exclusive right ? )
that are being rumored about for the future and would provide a good middleground for what i want .
i really like the wave and its looks , but the screen size is on the small size and it is n't running android .
the galaxy s looks too big and i definitely do n't like the design or aesthetics .
what else is looking on the horizon ?
