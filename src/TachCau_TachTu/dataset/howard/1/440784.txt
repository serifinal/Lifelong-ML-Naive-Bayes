can i get this voice / data plan from bell for an iphone ? .
i would like to purchase a new 3gs 16g iphone from bell and get this plan : 250 weekday min vm , call id unltd eve / wknds @ 6 pm unltd incom unltd text 1 gb data i will sign a 3 yr contract .
i would like to get the plan for $ 60 ( taxes included ) .
can i get this plan ?
where would i have best chance to get this plan ?
call bell ?
a bell corporate store ?
a third party reseller ?
i would just like to say to the rep that i will sign for 3 yrs if they can give me this plan ... though from reading it seems that typically reps tell us what we can get . .
just thought , why cant we make an offer for the plan and the price we want ( maybe we can - but they will tell us where to go ) .
ps - i would like to get the phone for $ 149 ( they normally sell for $ 199 on 3 yr contract ) ...
