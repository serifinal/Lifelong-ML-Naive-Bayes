good place to buy a factory unlocked iphone ? .
i need one to use between at&t in the u.s. and rogers in canada .
i just want it to be plug and play -lrb- not have to worry about jailbreaking and extra stuff everytime i update it -rrb- .
if i buy factory unlocked i can just update it normally right ?
is there anything else different about the factory unlocked iphones ?
i do n't care about the warranty , just want to be able to switch my sim card at will .
any recommendations on a reliable place to get one ?
thanks in advance !
