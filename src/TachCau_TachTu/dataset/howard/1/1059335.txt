is there en error on the unlimited international calling plan for blackberry .
i was thinking of getting the blackberry for my wife with the unlimited international calling plan .
it says its $ 10 a month on top of the $ 60 rate plan .
the other $ 60 plan comes with it and the smartphone plan is $ 50 a month and $ 10 to add it and it brings it to $ 60 also .
so $ 70 a month for blackberry users .
is that an error on the website .
i tried calling metro but they did nt have a clue of the new flat rate changes that included the tax .
i was shocked and hung up .
