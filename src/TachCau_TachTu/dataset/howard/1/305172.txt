iphone 4 vs. nexus one .
i have iphone 3gs and i have to shell out $ 500 for iphone4 and a long wait now .
i am really interested if people who have tried both iphone 3gs and google nexus -lrb- also $ 529 and unlocked -rrb- one to compare the phones please .
on usability , features , accessibility .
i have used many htc fans in past , wm phones , symbian etc and fairly conversant with unix/linux .
so on geekiness side i know android are great , more interested in direct comparisons from howard forum members who had handled both . .
i may take android road and ditch iphone4 altogether for a year thanks
