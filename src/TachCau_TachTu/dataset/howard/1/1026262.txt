anyone ditching wm for the nexus one ? .
wow , it 's been dead around here lately .
i know , i know , wm 6.5 .
so now that the n1 is out and is supposedly going to displace the iphone as the ultimate " superphone , " who is jumping off the wm bandwagon to get one at a measly $ 530 ?
( well , measly compared to the $ 700 - $ 1000 we 've been paying for our old htc devices ) i 've been using all of my self control not to order one .
i want one pretty badly , especially for the navigation .
the whole device just looks so delicious that i ca n't resist .
almost .
the only things that are stopping me are : 1 .
i just got my tp2 in july , and while that is ages ago for most people on this board who get a new device every 3 months ( i 'm jealous of you all ) , i ca n't justify dropping almost $ 600 after taxes on the n1 when my tp2 is still so new ( not to mention i love it ) .
2 .
no hardware keyboard on the n1 makes me nervous .
just when i think i can get by with no keyboard because i am fine with using the software keyboard on my tp2 and i do n't feel like sliding out the real keyboard , i get an email or a text and i need to slide out the keyboard to reply or i 'll go crazy .
not sure i 'm ready to do without a bonafide keyboard .
3 .
i just had to hard reset my tp2 and microsoft myphone was an awesome experience ( along with sashimi ) .
i do n't know if google has anything similar to make reinstalling after a hard reset so easy .
in spite of this , though , i keep googling " nexus one " and staring at the photos .
i 'm not sure if i can hold out much longer .
what say you all ?
