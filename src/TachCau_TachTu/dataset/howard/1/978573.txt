factory unlocked iphone 4 .
i am thinking of getting a facory unlocked iphone 4 ( e.g. from canada ) .
i am not very familiar with iphone settings ( i 'm nore of a nokia user ) so i have a few qs : i do n't use att -- should i be able to use a t - mobile data plan with it ?
is it just a case of cutting the sim to 3ff size and putting it in ?
as far as i can see , normal ( locked ) iphones do n't have easy access to the apn settings -- is it possible to edit those on a factory unlocked one ?
i assume there is no difficulty in swapping sims ( e.g. when travelling ) , and getting data working with the new sim 's plan ?
does the phone have any hiccups when doing this ( assuming my apn q above is solved ) ?
i asked twice in the us apple store about the international warranty -- they said that an unlocked foreign - bought iphone warrenty would be honored in the us -- does anyone have any comments on that ?
is it really true ?
ultimately , i may jailbreak the iphone 4 , but i want some assurance that it will work out - of - the - box initially .
