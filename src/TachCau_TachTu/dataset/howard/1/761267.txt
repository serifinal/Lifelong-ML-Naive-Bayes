video call / video chat / video messenger ? .
so i am planning on leaving sprint and getting an at&t tilt .
i noticed the unbranded kaiser has a camera on the front for video calls while the at&t branded tilt does not .
is there any way to get that front camera working on at&t ?
say i had 2 of the unbranded kaisers , 1 for me qnd 1 for my wife .
is there any app i could install that would let us video chat ?
