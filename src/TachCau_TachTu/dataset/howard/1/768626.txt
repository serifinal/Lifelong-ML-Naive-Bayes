google nexus one or htc desire for rogers network questions .
hey there guys , just need some opinions on the matter .
now i have been doing a lot of homework on both phones .
so far i 'm leaning towards the nexus one , because i do use a lot of data on the rogers network and i know the google nexus one supports 850 hspda and the desire only supports 900/1200 , does this mean that the desire will not run at all on the rogers network with 3g speeds ?
also i i like the fact that nexus one is already out , but from what i 'm hearing on the reviews , i 'm getting mixed bag reviews with the sound quality of the phone , some people are saying the the noise cancellation feature is really good , but the outside speaker is terrible , you can barely hear it , and the internal speaker for listening to calls is also really bad .
the sense ui is an attractive feature on the desire , but i know there is an alpha build of the sense ui which can be uploaded to the nexus , but i will wait on that down the road for a beta or even release .
can anyone tell me the major disadvantages to having the sense ui over the nexus ui ?
this means for updates in the future as well , as i 'm sure google always does updates on the phone from what i have been reading .
also the widgets in the videos i have seen for the sense ui , is that also available on the nexus ui ?
thanks for anyone able to answer these questions , and sharing their input .
