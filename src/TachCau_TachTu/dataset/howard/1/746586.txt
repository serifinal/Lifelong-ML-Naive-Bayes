micro sim upgrade logistics .
i wonder when the next iphone is released if the fact they require a micro sim going to cause a logistics nightmare .
when i go and upgrade i am going to want to keep my phone number , so any micro sim bundled with the new phone will be no good for me .
in the past people reused their existing sims this time everybody will be forced to replace them .
i do know you can cut down your original sim to fit but really how many people are going to that ?
