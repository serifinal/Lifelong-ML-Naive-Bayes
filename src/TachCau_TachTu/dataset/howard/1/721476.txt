nexus one real world usage battery life .
i 'm getting ready to buy one as i 've done away with at&t + the iphone 3gs ( love it but too expensive ) , so i jumped ship to the tmobile and thinking about getting a nexus one .
my big question is , what is the battery life like on this device ?
with respectable backlight brightness ( 50 % ) to get the daily pop from the screen but what is your typical battery life like ??
also can anyone recommend a good headphone for the nexus one ( hopefully pressing a button to scroll to the next song ) and what music app to use to play songs ?
