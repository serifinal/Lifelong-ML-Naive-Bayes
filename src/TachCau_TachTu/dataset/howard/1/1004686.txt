difference between the " unlimited data useage " and " email and web for smartphones " .
i just want to know the difference between the " unlimited data useage " and " email and web for smartphones " options as you check out on the verizon site .
i plan on getting a droid phone .
have n't decided which yet , but what is there difference between the two options as i check out ?
other than the $ 45 for one and the $ 30 for the other ?
