wtb / wtt : my 16 gb white iphone 3gs ( unlocked ) for your white ( or black ) telus hero .
pretty simple .
i have a mint 3gs as described in the post title that 's been sitting in a box for three months .
it 's been unlocked ( and updated to the latest firmware ) .
i 'm looking to either trade for a telus hero , or buy a hero outright from some enterprising canadian .
i can provide pics and anything else one might require if and when interest is expressed .
