wtb/wtt : my 16gb white iphone 3gs -lrb- unlocked -rrb- for your white -lrb- or black -rrb- telus hero .
pretty simple .
i have a mint 3gs as described in the post title that 's been sitting in a box for three months .
it 's been unlocked -lrb- and updated to the latest firmware -rrb- .
i 'm looking to either trade for a telus hero , or buy a hero outright from some enterprising canadian .
i can provide pics and anything else one might require if and when interest is expressed .
