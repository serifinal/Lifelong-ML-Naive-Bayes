is it possible to replace n82 lcd with n85 's amoled ? .
i broke my n82 's lcd while trying to replace the housing , so now i need to get a new one .
then it occured to me that maybe i can replace it with an n85 amoled lcd ?
i know that the n85 screen is bigger ( 2.6 inch ) , so i 'm not sure if it 'll fit .
also , i do n't know if n82 and n85 use the same plug for the lcd .
lastly , i do n't know if n82 can supply enough voltage to it .
so has anyone thought about this or actually tried it ?
edit : did some uber - rough theoretical measures , the width fits for sure , and the height should fit after some modifications .
edit 2 : scrap this , it looks like amoled screens use a different ic ( lds532 ) it drive them than tft screens .
edit 3 : actually , i think the display ic is mounted on the lcd 's pcb , so when you swap the screen , the ic is swapped as well .
thoughts ?
