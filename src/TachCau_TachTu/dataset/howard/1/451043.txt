iphone and $ 7 unlimited data plan ? .
i could n't find anything on google or this forum ... so i thought i should ask .
i currently have an htc touch with a $ 7 unlimited data plan ... i 'm thinking of getting an iphone on my current plan .
what i do n't understand is ... will the $ 7 somehow work on the iphone ?
i cant seem to wrap my head around how i can download / browse tons on my htc touch , yet with an iphone , i have to pay an incredible amount for unlimited .
any knowledge would be appreciated !
thank you .
