damn it .
voyager 510 crapping out on me already .
anyone ? .
i use my bluetooth headset about " 2 times " a year .
during summer time for about 2 ~ 3 months , and winter time for about 1 month .
summer is coming again , and i started using my voyager 510 that i got 1.5 year ago .
it has been flawless .
despite its ugly design , sound quality and fitment was 11 out of 10 for me .
i totally fell in love with plantronics .
however , this year is no good .
i charged it fully and just used it , and there is a lot of sound distortion .
its not the echo problem , but just static noise .
keep in mind , i always use this headset in exact same environment with nothing changed .
for example , i use it most of the times in my car or in my work room .
same car , same place .
no additional bluetooth / wifi stuff added that might cause the distortion .
i tried to lower the volume but the same distortion is there .
i do n't think the person on the other side can hear it , noise is within just my headset .
this never happened before .
i tried to reset bluetooth , reset connection , etc. .
did n't work .
im not angry at the headset actually , im just bummed that such good headset is crapping out on me .
does anyone know how to solve this issue ?
mean while , im researching on a new headset .
i thought about upgrading to voyager pro , but seeing so many people going back to 510 or purchasing 510 instead of pro due to price / performance ratio and some static issue with pros , im a little skeptic about the pro .
it seems like aliph jawbone prime , plantronics discovery 975 is doing well according to magazine reviews .
is this true ?
can someone recommend me a headset under $ 100 ?
appearence is a zero concern .
im more geared towards fitment and sound quality .
