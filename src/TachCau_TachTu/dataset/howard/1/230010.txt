verizon : buy one motorola droid get an htc droid eris free question .
my wife does n't really want the htc eris with the data plan so if i was to buy the motorola droid for myself and put the free htc eris on my wife 's phone number temporarily for 1 day , would i then be able to switch my wife 's phone number back to her old env with no data plan and sell her `` free '' eris on ebay -lrb- clear esn ? -rrb- ?
what a schemer i am .
this would be too good to be true since both require a new 2 year activation with a data plan .
