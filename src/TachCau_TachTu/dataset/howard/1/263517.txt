getting a micro-sim for my unlocked iphone 4 ? .
hey everyone , been searching the net but ca n't seem to find an answer .
i have a 3gs so the large sim .
bought iphone 4 from apple.ca unlocked full price on launch day and it says it will be delivered tomorrow .
when you check out , it does n't let you pick a sim .
my question is how does it work to get a telus micro-sim ?
i 'm in toronto , i understand going to an apple store they 'll give you one for free but telus stores are closer and i do n't care if i have to pay $ 10 for it .
my issue though is can i go today for example and buy one so that i have it when i get the phone then just call in to switch it ?
or would they deactivate my current sim and then activate the new one in the store ?
my issue is that i need my 3gs to work until i get the iphone 4 as i need that phone for work and my condo concierge to tell me fedex is here !
i know i can always just get the phone then go into telus but would be nicer to have the sim ready and waiting already
