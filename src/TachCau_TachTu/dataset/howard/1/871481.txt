any non-smartphones able to sync microsoft outlook ( calendar and contacts ) ? .
cheers everyone .
i 'm switching to at&t ( from verizon ) .
initially , i wanted a wifi capable smartphone that could sync to microsoft outlook , but it appears that you must have a data plan if you get a subsidized smartphone .
i do not need or want the data plan , but i do want my phone to be able to provide calendar reminders and have the calendar sync to my microsoft outlook calendar at work ( manually syncing via usb cable or bluetooth is perfectly fine by me ) .
do you know of any non-smartphones that can do this well ?
i 've done a little research and it appears lg phones ca n't for the most part ( just a couple of verizon lg hones can - env 3 ( vx9200 ) , env touch ( vx11000 ) and chocolate touch ( vx8575 ) ) .
i 've read that nokia has a software application called nokia pc suite that can do this .
has anyone ever used this software and done this ?
if so , what was your experience like ?
was the calendar or contacts limited in info ?
what phone do you have ?
how much memory on the phone ?
i was think of trying the nokia 6350 or mural ( 6750 ) .
thanks in advance !
regards , mark
