hspa + router recommendations - rural setup ( unlocked ? ) .
gon na setup a rural internet for someone , looking for recs on how to get this done .
i 'm thinking 1 ) hspa + router , compatible with external / outdoor antenna .
2 ) hspa + router mounted in a outdoor enclosure , onto a tree etc. .
option 2 is more complicated , but i do n't have to deal with signal loss on long antenna cables , since the cables will be only the power cable and an ethernet cable ( or a wifi ap ) .
i did a test run with an android phone ... using wifi tethering , with my phone outside positioned at a particular angle i was able get 1mbit with fairly stable pings .
the connection felt very fast for web browsing , i want to make it even better with a setup as indicated above .
i heard there 's even some routers with a built in pstn port to make voice calls ( awesome ! ) .
although if i can get this connection stable enough , voip over 3g might be more interesting .
i 'm certainly not willing to pay 150 $ more for one that supports voice .
ideally i 'd like this device to be unlocked , but if it 's rogers - only , i wo n't complain ... i 'm probably gon na get the 5gb ipad plan , hopefully by using only 2gb per month they wo n't care ...
