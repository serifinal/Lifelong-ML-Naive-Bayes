wtb : nexus one -lrb- at&t / rogers 3g bands -rrb- .
hello hofo members !
i am looking to buy a nexus one in 10/10 condition .
i will not take any phones that have even a scuff on it .
- please keep that in mind .
i prefer the rogers/at & t 3g bands but i will take a t-mo if the price is right .
i am located in canada so i would prefer to buy from a canadian or someone who can mark it as a gift so i avoid those nasty customs .
the phone must have it 's original box .
please contact me via e-mail -lrb- look below -rrb- or pm .
i guarantee a fast response to either one .
i prefer if you e-mail me .
