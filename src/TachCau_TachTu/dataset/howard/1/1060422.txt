important pre-paid porting question .
i have a question about porting a verizon pre - paid phone number over to page plus .
i have a verizon pre-paid account and i want to buy a new phone ( samsung i760 ) and then switch to page plus once i receive the new phone .
i currently have an old pre-paid flip top nokia phone that i plan to trash after i get the new samsung i760 and switch to page plus .
i plan to switch and activate the new samsung to page plus at the same time so the samsung phone will never be on my verizon pre-paid account .
the samsung phone will be brand new and never activated before .
my question is will i be able to port my old pre-paid number to page plus so i can use the samsung i760 .
i am getting mixed answers when i call around to some local page plus dealers here in south jersey .
can anyone clear this up for me before i purchase the new phone ?
thanks
