switching to p + .
well , i 'm yet another who will be making the switch to page plus shortly .
i bought a verizon prepaid at target a few weeks ago , and activated it on page plus to test out the network , and i think it 's going to work out just fine .
from reading this forum , it seems like it will be difficult to covert the prepaid we bought to access data on the page plus network , so i will probably use that for my wife 's line when we port -lrb- she does n't use the data anyway -rrb- , and i 've bought a htc touch diamond off ebay for my use -lrb- it was advertised as verizon , but it 's branded alltel ... so hopefully that does n't come back to bite me -rrb- .
i 'm planning on porting my wife 's line over first -lrb- since she has the secondary line in our current sprint account -rrb- to the test phone we 're using now and changing it to the unlimited talk/text , then porting mine to the touch diamond on the 1200 minute/text a month plan , mostly because i 'd still like to have a little data to check emails remotely from time to time .
thanks for everyone 's advice in other threads on this forum -- i think i 've read enough i 'm ready to make the plunge .
any other `` gotchas '' that stand out that i should watch out for in this process ?
