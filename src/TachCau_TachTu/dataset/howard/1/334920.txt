ctr - 500 ( cradlepoint router ) and uma ? .
i need to know for a international trip i 'll be taking .
i plan to get a usb modem with unlimited data in the country i 'm going to ( uk ) so i can plug it into my ctr - 500 and then use that wi - fi signal to get uma on my t - mo bb to call back home ( us ) for free .
does anyone know if it 's possible to use uma off of a ctr - 500 router ?
i would try it myself but i do not have a usb modem of my own , nor any other phone to try .
