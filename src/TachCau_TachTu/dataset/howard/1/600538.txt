bell turbo hub .
does anybody have any information on the bell turbo hub ?
from what i know its basically a turbo stick that runs off the 3g hspa network but allows you to connect up to 15 computers .
i need a hispeed internet solution for my business but the standard cable or dsl service is not available in my area .
it needs to be solid and reliable .
does anybody have any first hand information on this service ... i ca n't afford to play guessing games ... it needs to be fast and work all the time .
thanks .
