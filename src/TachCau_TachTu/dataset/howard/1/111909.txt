questions before buying 5800/5330 xpressmusic .
hi , i lost my samsung at&t phone and am considering nokia 5530 and 5800 .
my questions are about 3g and ovi store .
my phone use is voice , texting , and message with photo .
i do n't have a data plan .
am i going to be okay with non-3g phone ( 5530 ) ?
to get the mail - in rebate , i have to activate ovi store , pressing ovi store button on the phone .
is this some kind contract to buy ?
