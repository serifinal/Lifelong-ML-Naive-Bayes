data only plan - can i add some minutes .
hey guys , i 'm about to order a nokia n900 and i really want to have data on it , i called t - mobile and they have a data only plan / sim that i can get for $ 39.99 a month .
i think it is a bit steep but w / e. is there a way i can add some minutes to the data plan sim ?
either 100 minutes a month or something or just a pre-paid amount of minutes ?
the phone will be for data and video stuff while traveling so the minutes would be primarily for situations when i do n't have my bb on me ... thanks guys , mike
