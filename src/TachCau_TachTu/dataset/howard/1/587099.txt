will unlocked gsm bell / telus phones work on fido ? .
i 'm dying to get a bb9700 and have a friend who can use their bell blue chips to get me one .
i 'm just wondering if i get it unlocked , will it work with fido service ?
i 'm looking for at least 3g speeds for browsing , calling and basically whatever else bbs were made to do .
or any other gsm phones that come out with bell / telus for that matter , if unlocked , will they work with fido / rogers?thanks for your input !
