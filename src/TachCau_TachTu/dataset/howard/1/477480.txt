does memory class speed make much difference on a smartphone ? .
i currently purchased an htc pro2 .
i am interested in adding some additional memory , possibly at least 8gb or 16gb .
problem i hit is , would the class speed really make much difference on this phone , i know there 's class 2,4 , and 6 , 6 being the fastest , 2 being the slowest .
also is there any brand that 's not too compatible with the htc pro2 ?
i know my old env touch did not like kingston modules .
i am mostly trying to figure out if it 's really worth paying extra for a class 6 vs a class 4 and i also notice the higher the memory the more rare it becomes for a class 6 modules , all i see is some odd name brands for the 16gb modules .
whats a good place to buy non-counterfeit memory well priced ?
