does virgin mobile texting have issues ?
long delays , never delivered , etc. .
i 'm considering a rumor2 with texter 's delight but a few google searches have shown people mentioning if they text to a certain carrier like verizon the text never goes through or that they 'll recieve texts with hours of delays from when it was sent .
is this true ?
do you have any issues with texting ?
are the issues known but it 's a " you get what you pay for and it 's not a deal breaker for me " thing ?
because that would definitely be a deal breaker for me if it took a few hours for someone to get my text ( if they get it at all ) .
thanks .
