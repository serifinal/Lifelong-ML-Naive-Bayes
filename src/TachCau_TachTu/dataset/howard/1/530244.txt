hd2 or iphone4 .
hello , i really want a new phone !
my current phone : lg cookie , well i 'm tired of it .
i gave it a few new interfaces and tweaked it etc , but its not a good phone for me .
now my friend has the hd2 , i really like it especially the screen .
and also the coming iphone4 i really like .
my phone subscription ( is that the right english word ? )
lasts 8more months its from hi , a dutch phone - company , in the last 4 months i can get a new phone , but that takes to long .
so should i buy an hd2 for 450euro simlock - free and get an extra unlimited internet with it .
( 10euro / month ) or should i get the new iphone4 + subscription which i do n't know the price of yet , but if it 's the same as the 3gs now it would cost me 20euro a month ( that is + internet ) +350 euro for the phone , and i still have my old subscription .
my friend know all about the hd2 he has about a 100games + many more apps he knows al about different interfaces and other tweaks , and i have a 16gb micro sd card .
but ofcourse the iphone4 has many more apps to offer , and some nice new features and it has 32gb of space , but a smaller , but higher resolution screen .
i personally think that the hd2 screen would fit me better as i 'm not looking at the screen so close that i can see the pixels , so i do nt see a big advantage in the iphone4 screen , and the hd2 screen is so big and i think its better for the internet or watching movies .
what do you recommend me ?
