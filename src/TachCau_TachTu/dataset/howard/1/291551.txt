nokia 5800 apps & wifi questions .
hi gang , so bought the nokia 5800 last night and have a few questions as i set it up .
first , i thought i 'd see how it is for browsing the net .
while i have n't yet signed up for the unlimited mobile browsing , figured could use my wifi at home .
while it sees it and connects okay , when i try to go to a website , says i need to get the umb plan or pay the day charge .
is rogers blocking the wifi , or i am not doing something right ?
next up , i 'm going to get umb , with the $ 20 voicemail , call id , text package .
i read through most of the stickyed thread here in the forum , but still confused .
will i be charged if i download and use 3rd party apps like google maps , accu weather , twitter ?
i assume the pre-installed apps are free .
finally been told the built in web browser is okay but not great .
therefore i 'm looking at getting at either opera mini or skyfire .
one better than the other ?
can i use both with umb ?
thanks in advance for any info .
cheers ,
