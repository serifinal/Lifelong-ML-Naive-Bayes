iphone share plan not soo bad . . .
am i missing anything ?
my wife and i are probably going to get iphones .
we are looking at the shared $ 100 plan .
450 + 50 minutes ( shared ) unlimited calling between both phones unlimited text messaging ( we 're picking this option ) 3 gb shared they are throwing in the standard caller id / vm option for free over 3 years . .
my wife and i do n't talk very much on the cell phones . .
so texting is more important . .
she wo n't use that much data . .
i will . .
but i do n't think i 'll burn through 1.5 gbs per month . .
i hope . .
am i missing anything ?
that is about $ 50 per phone .
