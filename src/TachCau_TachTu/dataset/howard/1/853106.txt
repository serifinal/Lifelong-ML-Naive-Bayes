please suggest a solid / reliable phone that works with telus hspa network .
i would like to make the switch to hspa and am looking for a phone that offers : - exceptional reception and call quality - qwerty keypad ( makes txting easy ) - ability to transfer contacts from outlook to the phone i am not looking for data ( i.e. email or web ) and i know that hspa is really geared to this market .
i figure if i am to renew my contact , i might as well go on the new network then the existing one .
so to that end , what phones ( either sold by telus or other vendors ) would work on telus hspa network in toronto area ?
thanks ,
