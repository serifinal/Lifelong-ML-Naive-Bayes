samsung galaxy s with at&t 3g bands .
does anyone know if a version of the galaxy s is going to be released with the at&t 3g bands ?
i 've heard at&t is supposed to be receiving the captivate , however , i have no interest in picking up a branded -lrb- and most likely crippled -rrb- phone .
i wanted to purchase an unbranded and unlocked galaxy s that supports at&t 3g , but i search google and the forums here and found no information about where to purchase one , or if one even exists .
it shows on gsmarena.com that there is supposed to be a version of the galaxy s with at&t bands but i wanted to know if anyone has any information on where to purchase one or if one is actually going to be released and when .
thanks !
