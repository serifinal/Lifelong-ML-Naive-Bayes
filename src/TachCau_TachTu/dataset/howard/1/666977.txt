nexus one ... from an ex-iphone 3gs pov .
i have been seriously considering jumping into the android pool and replacing my iphone 3gs with a nexus one ... but i 'll admit to being more than a little concerned about jumping to a phone with so small a support base , and one that may or may not be better than my iphone .
i ca n't very well go to my local google store and play with one ... and it seems there is a lot of buck-passing between google & htc over warranty responsibility .
although i 'm a phone junkie ... i am not really a techie or geek , so all the advantages of the android os being `` open '' compared to the ultimate closed platform of the iphone os means little to me .
could i get some good , objective advice for/against the n1 compared to the iphone 3gs from those of you who have made the switch ?
please tell me how they compare in ... 1 .
fit/finish - quality and solidity of build -lrb- hardware -rrb- ?
2 .
volume of earpiece speaker & quality of incoming calls ?
3 .
consistancy of 3g network connectivity w/at & t service ?
4 .
speakerphone performance 5 .
battery life thanks very much in advance !
