which carrier has the best iphone data / voice plan ? .
i 'm going to get an iphone but do n't know which provider to sign up with as their plans all seem to be about the same .
i need about 500 mins local calling , 300 mins long distance ( primarily within canada ) , vmail , call display , 2g data should do it .
i have been with rogers for about 15 yrs - never had an issue with availability but their customer service could use some improvement .
i have bell landline and tv .
can i get some opinions on the other carriers wrt iphone packages ?
i see that fido has per second billing which is attractive .
how can i get the best deal ?
thanks .
