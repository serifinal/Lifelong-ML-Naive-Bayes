nexus one vs. iphone .
http://www.fevermagazine.com/a/techn...vs-iphone.html now that google?s nexus one phone has been revealed , the question everyone is asking is how does it compare to the other current top smartphones on the market , most notably , iphone and motorola droid ?
moreover , is it worth switching to nexus one from your current device ?
billshrink has put together a handy comparison chart that breaks the devices down ( including palm pre too ) on all key features .
there are a few obvious differences ?
the iphone ( iphone ) still lacks multitasking while the android ( android ) devices have fewer apps ?
but for the most part , the devices are fairly similar on paper .
the biggest difference is total cost of ownership , and nexus one wins big there over iphone and droid because t - mobile?s plans are less expensive than those offered by at&t and verizon , who carry the iphone and droid , respectively .
but that comes with a caveat too ?
t - mobile?s 3g coverage isn?t on par with that of verizon , and even trails that of the much maligned at&t .
overall , it seems just about impossible to pick a winner just off the specs , but here?s a look at how the device?s stack
