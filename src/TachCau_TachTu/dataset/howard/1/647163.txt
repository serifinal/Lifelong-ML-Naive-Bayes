need input for new sticky thread - " official sprint discounts " .
we are looking for official links / procedures to available discounts sprint offers .
preferably these will be the most recent ones of course .
this has been a common question and it would be of benefit to many if we had a central common thread to which we could edit as new info comes in .
the sticky thread will be started / edited once we can establish a common list !!
