to wait or not to wait ... that is the question !!! .
hi everyone i am now bored with my iphone and want to switch to a blackberry bold 9700 .
so my first question is that should i wait a little longer for a new blackberry ?
i heard that there was going to be a new blackberry coming to rogers later this year .
i also heard that it was going to be a touch screen blackberry .
is this information correct ?
my current plan with rogers is : 250 / unlimited eve / wkds plan ( starting at 8:00 pm ) unlimited incoming calls - credited rogers to rogers calling - credited voicemail - credited call display - credited ends october 08 , 2011 i also have the $ 30 for 6 gb data plan , which ends on june 23 , 2010 .
plus , i add the $ 3 for 30 text messages to my plan .
i end up paying about $ 63 each month .
i wanted to go over to bell with this plan : up to 500 minutes 2 gb data unlimited sent and received text , picture , and video messages call display message center voicemail to text video calling gps nav bonus : unlimited nhl pick of one of these : nationwide fab five , unlimited sent and received text ( but this is already included in the plan ) , double you anytime minutes , extend hours ( 5pm - 7am ) call waiting conference calling call forwarding no system access fees this plan is $ 100 per month , but since i am a wal - mart employee , i get 50 % off any plan .
so this plan would cost me $ 50 per month .
i would end up paying $ 57.35 each month .
i save about $ 5 each month and no worrying about going over my text messages .
if i leave and go to bell , my sister is going to be taking over this plan , without data .
so do people suggest i wait for the new blackberry on rogers or move onto bell ?
thanks
