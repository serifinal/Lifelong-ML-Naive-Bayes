cheapest way to get samsung galaxy s and / or wave .
what 's the cheapest way to get a samsung wave and / or galaxy s as a new customer ?
i got some friends who are new bell customers too and they were able to get some excellent plans from bell a while back , something that 's comparable to my own fido plan in sig .
i understand they 're smart phones so they both require data plans to get them at the bell and best buy advertised price , but what if i do n't get a data plan ?
