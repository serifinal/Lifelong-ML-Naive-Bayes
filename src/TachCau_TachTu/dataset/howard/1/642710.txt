samsung i7500 galaxy on wind mobile .
specs : http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_i7500-2791.php it looks like this phone will be on wind .
in this other thread there 's a video of samsung canada demoing the omni 2 and galaxy .
they said it 's going to be released by the end of the year .
the only version of galaxy that currenlty exists only has 900 / 2100/1700 bands .
which means it 's not compatible with rogers / bell / telus 3g ( rogers in 2g only ) .
the only company with a compatible network in canada by the end of the year is wind .
dave will also be compatible but they wo n't launch until early 2010 .
interestingly , wind greece and italy also sell this phone on their websites .
i 'm looking forward to android and amoled capacitive touchscreen .
