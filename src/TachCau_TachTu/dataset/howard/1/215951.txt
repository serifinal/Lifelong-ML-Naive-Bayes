iphone 4 : use another line to upgrade ?
micro sim swap possible ? .
if i have 2 lines and only 1 of them is available for the upgrade , so i ordered on that line , but i want to really use the iphone 4 on the non-upgradeable line ( my line ) .
how will that work with swapping the micro sim ?
do i have to get a separate micro sim from the store for my line ?
thanks
