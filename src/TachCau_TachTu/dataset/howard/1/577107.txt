samsung vibrant from bell on virgin .
hi all , i 'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question but here goes ... i am on virgin mobile and recently broke my phone .
i was wondering if it is possible to buy a samsung vibrant from bell and then use it on virgin mobile .
would i need to unlock the phone and/or buy a sim card ?
thanks
