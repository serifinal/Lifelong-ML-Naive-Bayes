ditching old phone , switching to iphone .
quick question guys , sorry if this has been asked before through searching , i know that an unlocked 3gs 32gb iphone will work on the new bell network with a sim card ... but since i already have an existing bell plan on my lg vantage -lrb- non-smart phone , and internet has been disabled -rrb- can i just ask them to give me a sim card , and put it in my iphone ?
no questions asked ?
and still remain on my old plan ?
