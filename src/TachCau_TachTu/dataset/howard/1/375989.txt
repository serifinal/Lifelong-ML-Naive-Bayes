using an unlocked iphone on hspa and keeping current plan on telus .
i have had differing answers on this so please reply if you have a concrete answer i want to get an unlocked iphone ( or telus iphone ) and put it on my plan i have heard that you can just go purchase a sim card from a telus dealer , then call telus to swap your plan onto the sim card .
from what i hear , they wo n't swap your unlimited data over ( you have to purchase one of their new add - ons ) but they will swap over your freebies ( unlimited text , caller id , vm , incoming calls etc ) now , will i be able to put this sim into the iphone and use it ?
some people say it will work fine in the iphone while others are saying it will work in all other smartphones but the iphone .
a telus csr told me today that it wo n't work in the iphone but i have read other postings saying the contrary i need a definitive answer so i can decide what to do next .
thanks !
