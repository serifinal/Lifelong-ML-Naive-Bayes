will any lg micro-usb data cable work .
i am looking on ebay for a data transfer cable to use with bitpim or datapilot for reading the contacts off the phone .
but i 've noticed that if i search for ( ax155 , " ax 155 " ) ( data , transfer , usb , cable ) the prices are ( naturally ) higher than a search for ( microusb , " micro usb " ) ( data , transfer , usb , cable ) .
but will pretty much any data cable work ?
especially if it mentions it 's compatible with a similar lg phone ?
also what software works with the ax * phones ?
will lg desktop , lg phone manager , or lg phone tools work with them ?
i bought an ax5000 off of ebay and want to move my stuff over to it .
