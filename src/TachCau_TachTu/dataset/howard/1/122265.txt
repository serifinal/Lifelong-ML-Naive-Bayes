nokia 5800 phone plan questions .
hi , i am going to get a nokia 5800 for my wife , right now under our roger account my wife rogers plan is on month to month , and my iphone ( hup upgrade last july ) is just past the first year of the 3 yrs contract ( voice and 6gb data plan ) .
my question is there any hup on my wife month to month plan ( right now there is no contract on that phone ) ?
and is there a family plan that can share the voice and data with iphone and nokia 5800 ?
i need the advice to see which way should i do , continue 2 indiviual plan or just a family plan .
thanks guys .
