strom ( ugh ) to iphone4 .
heya , so i 've finally decided on iphone , i currently have a bb storm 1 and i have about 17 months left on my contract .
i have unlimited data on my bb storm .
i 'm thinking of purchasing an iphone from apple and continuing my contract with telus .
is that possible ?
... of course , unless i weasle a subsidized iphone4 from telus for another 3 years ... .
cheers .
