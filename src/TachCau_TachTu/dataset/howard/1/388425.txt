few questions regarding upgrading to iphone4 .
i bought my iphone 3g back in april 2009 , of course a few months later the 3gs came out ( they said they did nt know it was coming out , i asked before i bought a 3g ) .
anyway , not apparently i have to pay 399 for an iphone 4 when other peeps that bought 3gs only pay 159 .
sucks but i can suck it up .
anyway a few questions : 1 .
if i upgrade at the 399 price through bestbuy will they just bill my rogers account or must i bring money with me ?
2 .
should i bring a copy of my account statement with me then ?
3 .
would it make more sense to just pay full price from apple for a unlocked iphone4 , then next year when the 5 or whatever comes out , i can upgrade to that for cheap through rogers and sell the 4 for a still good price ?
any help or other info would be appreciated , got ta go to work soon and would like to figure this out before then if i can !
thanks
