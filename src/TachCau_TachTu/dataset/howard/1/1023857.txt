will bell / telus 3g work for fido ?? .
im planning on purchasing a blackberry bold 9700 from either bell or telus , but im concern that the 3g network on the phone may not work with my fido sim card ( which is what im currently using ) .
any ideas ?
ps .
not sure if this is the right forum for this question .
sorry if it 's not .
