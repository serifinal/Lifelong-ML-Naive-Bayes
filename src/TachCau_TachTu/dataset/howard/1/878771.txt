how do i get a micro-sim card from telus ?
( for iphone 4 ) .
hello .
i 've never owned a smartphone before and am looking at jumping straight to the iphone 4 when it 's released .
i currently have a nice phone - only plan from telus ( no data ) , so i do intend with sticking with them into the future .
if i buy my iphone from apple , i 've read that it 'll be ' unlocked ' , thus able to go on to the carrier of my choice ( telus ! ) .
how would i get a micro-sim card from telus ?
would it be less complicated to purchase my iphone 4 through telus instead ?
would delivery times from apple vs. telus be similar ?
thanks !
