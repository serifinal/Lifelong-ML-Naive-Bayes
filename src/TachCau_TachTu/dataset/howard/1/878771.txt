how do i get a micro-sim card from telus ?
-lrb- for iphone 4 -rrb- .
hello .
i 've never owned a smartphone before and am looking at jumping straight to the iphone 4 when it 's released .
i currently have a nice phone-only plan from telus -lrb- no data -rrb- , so i do intend with sticking with them into the future .
if i buy my iphone from apple , i 've read that it 'll be ` unlocked ' , thus able to go on to the carrier of my choice -lrb- telus ! -rrb- .
how would i get a micro-sim card from telus ?
would it be less complicated to purchase my iphone 4 through telus instead ?
would delivery times from apple vs. telus be similar ?
thanks !
