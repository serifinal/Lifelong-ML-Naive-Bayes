adding a line to an acii family plan .
i have been with verizon for many years , i currently have an old americas choice ii family plan -lrb- which i do n't really want to change at this time -rrb- with 3 lines of service .
i am considering adding another line for my father , he is older and probably wo n't be calling anyone outside of the other three family members already on the family plan , so i feel that he will be using little or no minutes .
i had a few questions about this scenario , and wondering what people would recommend .
just wondering what the cheapest and easiest route is to do this ... 1 -rrb- can i still add a new line for 9.99 to my old acii family plan ?
2 -rrb- i have an old verizon motorola e815 laying around that i am not using , it 's in good condition but i think i will need to get a new battery for it .
do you think it 's better to get one of the new free phones -lrb- or almost free $ 20 phones -rrb- and activate that phone on the new line ?
or should i just activate my old e815 for him , with a new battery ?
what are the pros and cons of this ?
-lrb- i realize that if i get a new phone for him , it will create a new 2 year contract for his line of service , this is n't a big issue . -rrb-
3 -rrb- if i do decide to get him a new phone , which inexpensive or free model would be the best -lrb- one with the best reception and battery life would be ideal . -rrb-
4 -rrb- it is better to go to a verzion store and do this or can i do this though my online account ?
are they going to charge me an activation fee to add this new line ?
