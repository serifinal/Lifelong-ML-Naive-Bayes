email issue on motorola droid .
when i first got my droid ( not long ago ) it would notify throughout the day that a new email had arrived .
similar to the way an sms text arrives , the phone beeped , an entry for the new email showed up along the top , etc. .
for the past week or so this no longer occurs .
if i go to my email and click refresh , all the new messages appear that were received since last time i manually refreshed .
i ca n't seem to figure out why the phone is no longer checking for new messages throughout the day and notifying me of them .
i have n't changed anything .
one of the email accounts is through aim.com , the other is through a private isp .
like i said , they were working perfectly until they spontaneously stopped .
any suggestions ?
