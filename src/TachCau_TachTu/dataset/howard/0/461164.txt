ca n't connect to pageplus after factory reset .
hi ... i recently reset my samsung smooth to its factory settings and now i ca n't get connected to pageplus .
after the reset i dialed * 22890 and received a successful activation message .
however when i try to make a call it connects to verizon instead of pageplus and says they can not identify my phone .
the home sid is correct and so is the prl .
i do n't know if the min is correct since i never paid any attention in the past .
however , my directory number is correct so i assume the min is also .
any ideas ??
