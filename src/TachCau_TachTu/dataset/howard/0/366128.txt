sign up for ipad data plan without using ipad hardware and regular sim .
if anyone is interested in trying this out i believe it should work .
if you wanted to activate the ipad data plan but you do not have an ipad 3g or a microsim you can likely still do it on your pc .
what you need to do is open a webkit based browser like apple safari or google chrome .
go to the following url : https://www.rogers.com/web/hspa.portal?dev=cp&sim=89302720xxxxxxxxxxxx&imei=0 & lang = en change the number of the sim = to be the number on your brand new sim card .
( can not re-use an old sim or some of the sim 's that came with a renewal phone etc. ) it should be a brand new retail sim or micro sim not tied to any account .
follow through with the user and credit card info .
normally on the ipad your device would try to connect with the apn internet.com and then load this website to sign up for a plan .
when you had completed the signup the ipad would switch to using the rogers - core - appl1.apn apn .
if you already have an ipad plan then try loading this page with your already active microsim card number and see if it gives you the ability to see your usage .
