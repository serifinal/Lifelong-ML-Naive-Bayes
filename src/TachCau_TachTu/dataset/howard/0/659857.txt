samsung vibrant shuts off , wo n't start up .
i 'm hoping someone can give me some tips .
i bought the samsung galaxy s vibrant through bell 2 days ago .
since then it froze up once , twice it shut down on me .
i put the phone down , went to use it and the screen was blacked out , nothing worked .
i ended up taking the battery out and re-installing to turn the phone back on .
since i 've only had it two days i 'm a little concerned , it 's also my first smart phone so i 'm not sure if this type of thing is common .
thanks a bunch
