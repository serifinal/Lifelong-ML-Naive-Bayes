receiving late text messages .
hi , i 'm not sure if any of you have experienced this problem but lately my phone has been sending me some of my text messages late .
i 'm not sure if it has anything to deal with the fact the phone is unlocked -lrb- at&t phone -rrb- , but the messages i receive and the time stamp at which it was sent do n't seem to match up .
ex .
i 'll get a text message at 9:45 am the text message will say it was sent at 5:05 am i 'm not sure what the problem seems to be .
i ca n't tell if the messages are being sent on time and the time-stamp at the bottom of the message is wrong .
thoughts ?
