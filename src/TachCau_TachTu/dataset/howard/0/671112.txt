renewing line , adding line , and upgrading plan . .
any way to get better deal on phone ? .
hey guys , i currently have a basic family share plan with 700 minutes , 2 lines - basic text plans , but really no frills .
the primary line was just renewed last week , and i will be renewing the secondary line , adding a third line , and upgrading to a 1400 minute plan in the next few weeks .
i 've been a vzw customer for 4 years , no late charges , etc. .
my question is do csrs have any power to offer a better price than what the standard online price is on new equipment with a 2 - year activation ?
anyone had any luck in talking with the verizon folks ?
any info would be helpful , thanks guys !
