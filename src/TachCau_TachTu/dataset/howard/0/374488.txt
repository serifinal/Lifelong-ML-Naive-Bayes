" employee " type discounts with sprint .
we are currently with verizon but are considering a switch to sprint .
as most companies can give you a discount either through your work , aaa , bank affiliation , etc. , i have a question .
i do n't think you can do those type of discount plans if you buy and setup through best buy .
but my question is , once we are on the sprint plan from best buy can you then go directly to sprint to have them setup your discount plan for you ??
i may be able to save 15 - 20 % with a discount plan .
the reason i want best buy to set it up is due to the cost ( or cheaper costs ) of phones / free phones currently available vs. what the sprint store offers .
my son wants to pre-order the evo but will need a temp / free phone until it is available .
any suggestions and replies are greatly appreciated .
thanks !!
