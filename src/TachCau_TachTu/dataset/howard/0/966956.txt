gravity 2 t469 at&t mms settings .
i 've been looking around and finally found the mms settings for the gravity 2 from t - mobile to work on at&t .
here they are : ========== mms ============== * set name : at&t mms * access name : wap.cingular * auth type : none * user id : <leave blank> * password : <leave blank> * protocol : http * home url : http://mmsc.cingular.com * proxy address : 66.209.11.32 * port : 80 * linger time : 300 * advanced settings : o static ip : leave blank o static dns : leave blank o traffic class : subscribed i just decided to post this since there were several people asking for it .
once you have saved this profile .
make sure you select it .
once it 's selected it works for both mms and internet .
this works as of : 06/03/2010 3r14nd
