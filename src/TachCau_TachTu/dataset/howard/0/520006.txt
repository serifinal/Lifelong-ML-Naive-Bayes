how to satisfy a buyer of my iphone 4 factory unlocked it is factory unlocked ? .
i was hoping someone could help me out here .
i purchased an iphone 4 32 gb factory unlocked at the apple store today .
i 'd like to sell it and a potential buyer asked for its serial and imei numbers so he could verify it is factory unlocked .
i was uncomfortable giving those numbers because i 'm guessing he could somehow lock the phone or something -- i have no idea .
can someone with those numbers do something like that ?
anyway , this brings me to the main point of this message .
how can i satisfy a potential buyer of the phone that it is indeed factory unlocked , short of opening up the package and popping in their sim card ?
i 'd like to keep it sealed to retain value .
now an apple store employee told me all iphone 4 's are factory unlocked , and it is only when apple activates it to a carrier that they become locked .
but how can i satisfy a buyer of this so they will know i am legit ?
thanks in advance !
