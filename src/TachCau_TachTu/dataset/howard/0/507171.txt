lg keybo 2 -lrb- env3 -rrb- memory class ??? .
hello , i just got the lg keybo 2 -lrb- or env3 -rrb- and it supports up to 8gb micro sd card .
i know there are different classes -lrb- speeds -rrb- of micro sd cards , -lrb- class 2 , 4 , 6 , 10 -rrb- but at what class is the lg keybo 2 phone capable of ?
no sense paying more for a higher class if it 's not needed .
thanks for any help .
