lg keybo 2 ( env3 ) memory class ??? .
hello , i just got the lg keybo 2 ( or env3 ) and it supports up to 8 gb micro sd card .
i know there are different classes ( speeds ) of micro sd cards , ( class 2 , 4 , 6 , 10 ) but at what class is the lg keybo 2 phone capable of ?
no sense paying more for a higher class if it 's not needed .
thanks for any help .
