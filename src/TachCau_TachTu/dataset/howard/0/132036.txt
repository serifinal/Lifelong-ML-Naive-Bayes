tweet tweet .
i do n't know how to do it but google voice voice / caller id setup now works !
there is a skype update so do it first .
set google voice as your skype caller id a google voice number , one that rings all your phones , makes good sense as the caller id number for outgoing skype calls .
google voice blocked the verification sms that skype needed until recently , but google 's flipped the switch and made it convenient .
john , a lifehacker reader and fan of google voice and skype , tipped us off to a tweet from a google voice team member that indicated the google voice / caller id setup now works .
you 'll have to respond to the sms sent to your google voice number , but once you do , people you call with skype 's " skype out " service wo n't see a random string of digits , but a number they can actually call you back on .
