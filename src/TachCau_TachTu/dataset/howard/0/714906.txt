damn near switched to sprint this afternoon .
i took a look at my verizon account and bill and decided that it was time for a change .
i went online and look at the sprint phones and ultimately decided to just a tour with sprint and sell my tour with verizon .
well i went ahead with the activation and that process alone took damn near an hour .
after getting on the phone with sprint customer care ( that was an issue within itself ) i finally got set up and was good to go .
i took my verizon tour home and synced it up and got everything contact wise switched over .
i called sprint customer care again and got hung up on not once , not twice but five times .
anyway i called back again and finally got thru , thank jesus , and began to attempt to get this number ported over and i thought all was well .
three hours later , the number portability department called me on my sprint phone telling that it could n't be done only to find out that the person i gave the info to jotted it down wrong .
being very pissed now i chose to stick it out with verizon and cancel my line with sprint .
sprint 's customer care really really really needs to get it together .
this is my third time this year dealing with sprint and each and every time has been a headache and a half .
this had to be a sign that its meant for me to stay with verizon .
sorry sprint folk .
