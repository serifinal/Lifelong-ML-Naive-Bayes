such as " how do i sync contacts " or " here 's a suggestion ... " ----------------- updated : going into the programming menu : dial ## program , send , enter 000000 , verify 1 - for pictures , they 'd go best in the dcim folder .
inside that you can keep your images organized however you want and they 'll retain that organization in your " gallery " folder .
2 - for music , you can put them wherever you want ( i made a " music " folder ) .
3 - to set any audio file as a ringtone , open it in the " music " player and push the menu button .
you 'll have an option to set it as a ringtone .
4 - if you want custom " notifications " ( for mms / sms / e-mail ) you 'll need to create a " notifications " folder and drop the audio files in there .
they 'll then show up on the list in your settings .

i could receive but not send .
i called vzw tech support and ended up figuring out the problem for him ... lol .
for some reason i was able to send him a mms but none of my contacts .
that was the connection .
my contacts as exported through gmail from windows mobile had a number format like 1 (123)Â 123-1234 .
they worked fine for calling and text messaging so you 'd think they 'd work for mms too right ?
nope .
i picked up on this because i put in the verizon tech support guys number like 1231231234 .
after deleting one of my contacts and entering the number in like this ..... it still did n't work .... for some reason the phone remembered that it had been a contact .
after clearing the message thread and restarting the phone it worked .
so to get your mms working , give this a try .
1 .
delete any saved message thread , including sms ones , for the contatct you would like to try to mms .
2 .
then go to edit your contacts phonenumber .
just enter the 10 digit number whout a leading 1 and without any parenthesis .... let the phone put the dashes in for you .
3 .
( if you did n't have to delete a previous thread skip this step ) restart your phone .
4 .
try mms .
it worked for me and now i 'm going back through all my contacts to fix the number format on all of them .
------------------ here is what worked for me , but we are a small business with an exchange 2003 server : domain \ username : abc - corp \ jsmith ( server domain plus my server username ) password : ******* ( server password ) exchange server : mail.abc-corp.com ( after trying a few things that did n't work i gave up and simply directed it to mail at our domain and then the emails started rolling in ) it was seriously so easy that it only took me a couple of hours to realize it with the help of this thread .
i was unable to get in contact with our outside it people today and the new phone-itis was driving me crazy .
hopefully , you will find your work around soon .
