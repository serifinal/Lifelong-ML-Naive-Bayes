i am not receiving text messages .
so i am a bell customer , i have the sch - u740 phone with bell starting lastnight and continue to today i can recieve text messages from other bell customers i even sent a text message to myself through their online text thing but !
most of my friends are rogers customers and i am not recieving any of their text messages .
this has happened before when rogers did some sort of update about 2 years ago or something i just want to know when it will all be fixed - i am another person who can not live without text messaging thank you
