today at&t said that it will allow a new , optimized version of the slingplayer mobile application to operate over its 3g data network .
previously , the slingplayer mobile application was restricted to work only over wi - fi .
at&t tested the application during the last months of 2009 , and notified slingplayer that the new version of slingplayer mobile has permission to use its 3g network to stream television from slingbox 's to end - users ' handsets .
at&t has also notified apple , which sells the application to iphones , that the optimized application is free to run on at&t 's 3g network .
none of the companies involved have said exactly when the new version will become available , what its cost will be , nor how much owners of the wi - fi - only app will have to pay to upgrade .
