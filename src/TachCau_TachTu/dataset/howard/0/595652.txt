will the bell palm pre or iphone ( unlocked ) work with rogers network ? .
i 'm abit confused , a few years ago , none of the phones you get at telus / bell wwould work with rogers since they are on totally diff networks and do not use sim cards .
i 'm abit out of date , but it seems it works different now these days ( altho still different network cdma vs gsm ) so my question is , if i get a palm pre or iphone , and get them unlocked , will they work on rogers sim card ?
is this phone specific ?
what about telus phones , does it work the same ?
