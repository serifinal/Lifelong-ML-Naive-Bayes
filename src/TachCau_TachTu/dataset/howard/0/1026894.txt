droid wifi issues and getting froyo ( 2.2 ) update w / out vzw network .
i have a motorola droid .
i 'm currently not in a coverage for vzw and wo n't be til mid september .
when 2.2 is launched and my phone gets network coverage again .
will my phone still get the update , even if outside the launch window ?
also i 'm currently using my phone in airplane mode with wifi on as not to drain the battery looking for signal .
my problem is that even though i have my droid wifi set to never turn off .
i find it off all the time .
is there a way i can force it on .
i still want to use my data based services like gmail and weather .
but it will time out .
any ideas ?
thanks
