fs : iphone 3g [ s ] 16gb white & at&t 3g nexus one with dock ( rooted w / froyo ) both mint .
hello all !
friday is the epic day where my girl and i make the switch to sprint with our pre-ordered evo 4g 's !
that means we are looking to sell our at&t phones because we will no longer need them !
first phone for sale : iphone 3g [ s ] running unmolested 3.1.3 ( this is my gf 's phone and is in very mint condition .
comes with a pink iskin silicone case , box , manual , charger and anything else that it would come in new .
the phone is 9.9 / 10 and i only say that because im sure you will find the tiniest little scratch , and i do nt want negative feedback .
9.9 / 10 because its used , but never taken out of its case .
price : usdm $ 430 shipped / insured / paypal ' ed to anywhere in the continental us .
otherwise $ 420 plus whatever shipping costs are .
location : chicago no trades unless its a good deal ( laptop / electronics / non phones ) heres how the case looks : for sale : nexus one with at&t 3g bands .
this phone is mint .
theres not one scratch on this thing .
its been mine since the at&t verison came out ( 2 - 3 months ? )
with the oem google dock .
the phone has been rooted and unlocked , and currently running the leaked build of froyo 2.2 .
its running stable , but the phone 's roms can be changed on the fly .
