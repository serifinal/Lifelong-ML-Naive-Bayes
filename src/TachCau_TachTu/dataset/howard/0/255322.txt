are rogers current ipad micro-sims compatible with the iphone4 ? .
lads , so far i have been unable to get a straight answer out of anyone so i figured i would ask it here : are roger 's current micro-sims capable of having a standard voice / data plan put on them for iphone 4 use ?
i have an unlocked uk iphone 4 on its way to me as we speak , and i am prepared to cut my sim , but just curious if the rogers micro-sims were compatible .
some reps are telling me that the ones currently for sale have " locked " voice channels , or are otherwise incompatible with anything other than the ipad .
some reps are telling me that they are not locked .
can anyone shed some light on this ?
appreciate it in advance .
