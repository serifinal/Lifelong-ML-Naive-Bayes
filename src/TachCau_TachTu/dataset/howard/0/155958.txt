adding fan discount to existing line renews contract ? .
i have existing line with my iphone 3g which only has few months of contract left .
i 'm waiting for 4g to come out so i can swap the phone .
today i learned that my school has fan discount and went to the website , but , special benefits are provided solely as a result of the business agreement between at&t and your organization and are subject to change and / or discontinuation without notice to you .
requires a two year service agreement and qualified plan .
other restrictions apply .
if you have a question about your eligibility , please contact your organization 's benefits coordinator or telecommunications manager .
that red line scares me off .
i 'm almost at the end of 2 year contract and it would be dumb if i added another 2 yr contract at this point to get 20 % discount .
does anyone know what that line really mean ?
