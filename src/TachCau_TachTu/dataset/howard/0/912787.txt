microsoft office outlook ?? .
this is my work email .
ok , i have read many threads on microsoft exchange accounts and corporate vs non corporate accounts .
my confusion is ... you guys say you can not set up an exchange account , but i think mine is an exchange account .
it is set up , i can recieve and send new emails just fine , but when i press reply and type an email and then press send it wont send .
it puts the reply in an outgoing folder .
when i try and send the out going email i ca n't .
is ms office outlook an exchange account ?
how do i tell ?
or is it imap or pop3 ?
to add to my ignorance - at home i connect to ms office outlook account via the internet at home , ( webaccess.si.edu ) + password , that is how i set up the account .
is that correct ?
i tried to talk to my it guys and they would n't help .
( we do not support smartphone email usage they said ) .
thank you ,
