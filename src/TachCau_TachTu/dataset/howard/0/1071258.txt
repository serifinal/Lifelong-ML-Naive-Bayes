ccts news - " unlimited " decision , pc changes , crtc review .
a number interesting things going on with the ccts : - issued a decision about " unlimited " wireless plan vs 1gb / day usage .
( bell won , fair call by ccts : congruent with tos & aup ) .
more info : s : / / rogerswatch.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/ccts-decision-bell-vs-business-cx-re-unlimited-plan/ - they 've updated their procedural code ( the rules of how a complaint is : qualified as being in or out ' of scope ' , and handled ) - essentially a few small & medium changes to benefit the cx .
most important to be aware of is that after a decision is issued the cx has to formally accept the decision for it to be binding on the cx and tsp ( carrier ) .
( strangely though , a recommendation is still deemed to be accepted , unless the cx informs ccts that they " reject " the recommendation . )
more info : s : / / rogerswatch.wordpress.com/2010/06/09/ccts-procedural-code-changes-and-crtc-review/ - ccts is getting " reviewed " by the crtc : crtc wants a copy of all governing docs , reports on effectiveness , outreach , etc. .
it seems the public can file a written comment regarding the ccts up until june 28 .
