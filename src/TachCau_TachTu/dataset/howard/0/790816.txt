interviewing at vw retail store , advice ? .
i 'm really excited about it .
anything you could could tell me that may help with the process of interviewing ?
also , i 've read on this site and others , how verizon is scaling back pay and even consolidating / eliminating jobs ?
that quotas are unattainable ?
those are the main negatives any truth to these ?
i 'm a little concerned b / c i 've never seen vw posting job ads online ... they 've always had a long list of people that would love to work there .
is there high turnover these days ?
quotas getting people fired ; if so is it at the manager 's discretion who 's let go for performance reasons ( as i 've read on other sites ) ?
what about the positives , i feel like it would be great to work at vw .
i 'm at a job that 's challenging and limited growth unless you can relocate ... i think it would be a great place to start anew .
