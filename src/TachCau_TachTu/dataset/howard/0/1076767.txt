iphone 3g 8gb - bell problem - no service is displayed - issue is escalated .
hi guys , i have two identical iphones 3g 8gb running unlocked 3.1.2 , both freshly installed .
on the first iphone , i insert the bell sim card and i might see the bell network pop up for 3-10 seconds .
then , i get a `` no service '' for reception .
i can not use bell on my unlocked iphone !
-lrb- but it shows me i have voicemail ??
yet i 'm unable to access it ? -rrb-
i place the same sim card into my second iphone , and it works totally fine .
i tried inserting a rogers sim card into the first non-working iphone and that also worked totally fine .
so what could be wrong with my iphone ?
is this a problem with the bell network ?
both are running the exact same sw unlock and both were refreshed/installed fresh and synced with itunes to the same computer .
bell tech support has documented the problem but they were unable to solve it .
at first i thought it was the sim card but i had that replaced twice and it was still the same problem .
any ideas ?????????????
