bell u760 3g turbo stick problems .
hello , i have recently purchased a bell 3g turbo stick ( novatel u760 ) .
i have managed to get it working on my macbook ( leopard ) under my username .
my wife also uses the same computer and has her own account .
however the bell " mobile connect " software will not work when she is logged in .
the following error pops up : " mobile connect can not run from a locked disk .
unlock the disk or copy it to your hard drive . " .
any ideas as to what is going on ?
thanks !
