page plus , outgoing smtp server .
i 'm certain i 've asked this before .
on my palm treo , i can receive email from my at&t account , but i ca n't send it .
they do n't allow connections from foreign networks to their outgoing mail servers .
how is everyone else getting around this ?
it would be nice if pageplus had an outgoing mail server .
regards , hans
