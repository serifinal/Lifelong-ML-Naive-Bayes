looking for low minutes , reasonable data plan , with bb service , per second billing .
i 've read the fido bb faq and some of the general fido faq , as well as reviewing the fido website , but as my requirements stray into the realm of `` retentions '' i thought i 'd post .
i 'm currently a bb9000 -lrb- unlocked -rrb- user on a voice-only plan on another carrier .
fido and solo mobile are the only 2 carriers i know of in canada that offer per-second billing , but solo is still cdma only and bell is slightly more evil than rogers -lrb- perhaps equally evil , but i digress -rrb- .
i usually use less than or around 100 minutes per month of talk time .
i would like to have blackberry service and a small amount of general internet data to my plan .
i want voice mail , but i 'm not too fussy on call display .
i am keen on avoiding signing a contract : month-to-month , whether the talk time is billed by the minute or i pay for a bulk number of minutes .
some of the fido prepaid plans seem to offer vm&cid included , but not quite enough minutes to satisfy me .
if any fido insiders could suggest if the features that i have described are available without going on a multi-year contract , please let me know .
if it 's less than $ 40 per month all in -lrb- excluding taxes -rrb- , i 'm very interested ... if it 's $ 50 or over , i 'm wary ... if it 's $ 60 even if it has `` free evenings / weekends '' and other stuff i do n't need , it 's really a non-starter for me .
thanks in advance .
