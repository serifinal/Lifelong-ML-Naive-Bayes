weird reception issue .
at first , i thought my reception problems were a product of the roms that i was installing onto my phone .
that does n't appear to be the case anymore .
i noticed that when i put the phone down and do n't touch it , the reception bars will typically always show three or four .
when i pick the phone back up , i see them drop to one or two .
it 's a weird and frustrating problem .
has anyone else endured this ?
