transfer pictures from camera to 5730 .
hi , in our next trip to europe i want to use my ( soon to be purchased ) nokia 5730 as a backup for my pictures .
i have sd and sdhc cards that i 'd like to copy from 2 canon and 1 casio cameras to the 16 gb sdhc memory inside the 5730 .
i supose the 5730 does n't have an usb host mode but is there a way to copy the pictures without using a computer ?
thanks in advance !
christian .
