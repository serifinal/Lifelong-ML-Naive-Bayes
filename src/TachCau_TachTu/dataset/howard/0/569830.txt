possible to keep my plan with fewer minutes + $ 30 data with the new vibrant ? .
i 'm interested in an upgrade to the vibrant ( currently out of current and long time t - mobile customer ) .
just wondering if i could keep my current voice plan ( $ 30 ) and add the requisite $ 30 data plan to it rather than being forced into a plan with the unneeded minutes .
thanks ...
