lg rhythm stuck in s / w update .
told its in emergency mode .
okay so today i was just trying to get on the internet .
well it gave me a access denied so i did what i was told to do to fix it which was to reset the browser .
when i did it always goes to a reset ... the usual .
but when it booted up it went to a s / w update and got stuck there for hours .
i took it to verizon ( im alltell still ) and they said it is in emergency / recovery mode and there is nothing that they can do on their side yet it was their fault for forcing the fota ( firmware of the air ) update on my phone and crashing it .
i was wondering if there was a way to get it out of the emergency mode by any chance ?
