bell turbo hub router setup and questions .
hi all , i got a turbohub from bell , i am sastified with it compared to my old isp ( explornet ) .
but i must say it is not a land line connextion but it is way better .
here are some info ( specs , tweeks , questions ) that i would like to share with you .
first of you will probably never get the advertise speed from this device .
bell advertise " up to " 7 mb down and 5 mb up .
the upload is wrong it will not upload pass 2 - 2.5 mb .
as per the download i usualy et from 4 to 6 mb dl with full signal strenth .
i never hit 7 once .
latency . .
they advertise that hspa have a latency from 50 to 90 ms responce time .
this is the case most of the time .
but allot of time if you ping google or similar you will get 600 ms and i have seen up to 1800 ms responce times .
i can not explain why this is hapening ( possible firmware needs upgrade ) .
i have alsow read that if you hop from tower to tower it could cause high latency .
if that is the case a directional antenna would be a shure fix .
if you get one make sure you get one with tryban 800 1900 2500 mhz .
i have one but im still wating for the patch cable to come in from china .
is there anyone here that can tell meif i can upgrade my firmware ?
its dated 2008 and they have had several revision but i do nt want to brick my hub and i do nt want to be on hold with bell for 2 h. thanks zeg
