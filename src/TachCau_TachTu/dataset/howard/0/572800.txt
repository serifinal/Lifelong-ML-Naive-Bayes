can i take over a plan with data and use the sim in a rocket stick ?? .
looking to get rid of my telus unlimited plan .
rogers reception seems to be full here where my telus evdo card and iphone are always searching .
if i take over a cell plan with data ( 6gb ones ) can i just use the sim in a rogers rocket stick just for data ??
