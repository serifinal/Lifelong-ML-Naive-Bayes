upgrade another line for iphone without activation on the spot ? .
here 's the deal : went to the apple store to upgrade my brother 's line to an iphone .
i was planning on popping my sim into the phone after i got it for the contract price , but the employee told me i was n't able to do that because he had to activate the sim within the phone .
here 's the problem : my brother does n't live next to me , so if it does activate his number within the iphone , i assume his phone will be cut off until we can get that straightened out .
is there anyway around this ?
the employee told me no , and att told me the only way around this to buy the phone for full price .
surely i can just use the upgrade and pop my sim into it !?
thanks in advance -
