mms ( picture messaging ) on tmobile samsung galaxy s vibrant .
hey guys , set up my apn or wind mms and data .
data works , mms does n't .
pictures are stuck , saying " sending ... " or " downloading ... " .
as i try resending , some eventually say failed .
apparently this is a vibrant - specific problem .
anyone know how to resolve this ?
