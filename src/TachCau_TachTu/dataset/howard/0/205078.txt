adding laptop data to voice plan ? .
with the introduction of wind 's new cheaper laptop data plans , their justification of port blocking as a means of differentiating their data add - ons from the laptop plans kind of goes down the drain ... i know it sounds weird , but it would be interesting if there was a way to add the $ 25 1 gb social laptop as an add - on to a voice plan ... a bit more expensive than the $ 20 500 mb charged mobile add - on , but you get double the usage and 100 % unblocked ports .
any thoughts on this ?
considering that the $ 25 1 gb plan is cheaper per mb than the $ 20 500 mb add - on , i find it unreasonable that wind would be worried about the impact on their network of unblocking the ports on the add - on version but not the laptop version .
it does , however , sound more " reasonable " when comparing the $ 35 data add - on with the $ 45 laptop plan , since they are both unlimited but it essentially costs $ 10 more to get unblocked ports .
