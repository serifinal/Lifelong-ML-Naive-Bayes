coverage in s.w. calgary improved yet ?
light red vs. dark red on the coverage maps ? .
i am wondering if the coverage has improved in the far s.w. ( end of bow trail / wentworth ) yet ?
it was very spotty a couple of months ago .
i see on the wind coverage maps now that there is a red / covered area in two tones of red in calgary ?
is the darker red supposed to mean something ?
