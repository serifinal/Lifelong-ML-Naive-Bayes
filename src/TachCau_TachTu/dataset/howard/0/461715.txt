did anyone tried the microsim from the ipad 3g with the iphone .
i was just wondering if anyone with the 250mb $ 14.99 or the unlimited $ 29.99 plan from the ipad 3g have tried the microsim with an adapter to the iphone 3g or 3gs .
this might be an option for people that use only data on their iphones and does n't want the voice or the other option is having 250mb a month for light users .
