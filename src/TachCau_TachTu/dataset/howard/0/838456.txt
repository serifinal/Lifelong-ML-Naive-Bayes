a few questions before upgrading .
hey folks !
i have n't posted in awhile , but i remember these forums fondly as a great source of information on the ins and outs of both phone tech and the service providers .
good to be back !
my old phone 's charge port is corrupted , and i need to get something new .
i talked to an in - store rep briefly when i brought my phone in to be looked at , but i had n't done my homework on phones yet .
i 'm looking primarily at the samsung rogue and the intensity .
there is now a restocking fee when one returns their phone within the allotted time ?
and its 30 days now , not 15 ?
i spoke to a rep in - store who claimed that aim / yim messages sent ( even with a data package ) still consume text messages .
true / false ?
buying online seems to change most of the " mail - in rebates " i see in store to instant " online savings " .
if you know what you want , is there any " con " to buying online ?
i have a corporate discount through work .
apparently it applies to phones as well .
any way to see what discount applies to what phone ?
if it helps , its 16 % off my monthly bill .
it does not show up when i look at upgrading online .
transferring information between phones : is there a way to get old text messages , etc , transferred off my old phone as well as my address book ?
i 've got questions about the rogue as well , but i 'll go ahead and post them in the samsung forum .
