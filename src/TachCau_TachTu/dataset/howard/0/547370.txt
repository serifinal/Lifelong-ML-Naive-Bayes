us text messages .
another question i have after my conversion to hspa .... when i am in the us i am use to free text messages when i was on the cdma .
last time i was there i got a welcome text saying that text were 0.60 yikes !
are there any plans that you can get from retention , the easter bunny whoever that cover text while in the us ?
or is it really 60 cents per text ?
