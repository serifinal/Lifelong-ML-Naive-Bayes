boost refusing to activate nextel bb 7520 .
i purchased a starter kit sim and paired it with a hand-me-down 7520 which -lrb- verified with nextel -rrb- is not listed on any nextel account .
boost is refusing to activate it .
the automated phone activation system rejects it , the web system rejects it -lrb- because of the leading 01 -rrb- , and i have spoken with two tier 1 and one tier 2 phone reps who wo n't do it , either .
perhaps i 'm just terribly unlucky , but it sounds like boost may have tightened up their systems lately to shut out old nextel bbs .
