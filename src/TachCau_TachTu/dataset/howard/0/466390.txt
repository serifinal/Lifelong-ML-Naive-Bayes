but i did n't make or receive a call .
i was looking though my call records on the pp website .
on dec 9 , there is a 1 min call to my phone that i got charged for .
at that particular time , my phone was off and in my pocket .
i did n't have any " missed calls " and it 's highly unlikely anyone called me since only two people had my number at that particular point in time .
can anyone tell me why i got charged for a call i did n't make or receive ?
