upgrading from 3.0.1 with questions .
hey , i have a few questions .
i 'm planning on upgrading my jb 3.0.1 3gs to 3.1.2 .
1 .
am i correct that if i update via pwnage tool i wo n't lose my baseband ?
2 .
if i backup my iphone first and then reload the backup onto the phone after the update will it work or do i have to start from scratch copying all my apps etc. back ?
3 .
besides the carry logo problem -lrb- which is easily fixed -rrb- is there any other known issues ?
4 .
do i need my shsh off the phone or is that pointless since 3.1.2 is now hackable ?
if so , what 's the easiest way to do this ?
and finally , is it really worth it to upgrade ?
thanks in advance .
