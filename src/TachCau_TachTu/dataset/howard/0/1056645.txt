the official will only people with facts make an `` official '' thread .
should n't there be some sort of requirement to make an `` official '' thread ?
as opposed to `` hey , i have no facts to back up anything i speak about -lrb- which is fine because a lot of good discussion comes from conjecture -rrb- but based on `` my information '' , which is mostly comprised guesses and somehow tying in completely non-related actions by the carrier and/or manufacturer , i 'm gon na start an official islate pre-release thread '' .
stop it , please .
imo on mods and a couple other people should start `` official '' threads .
rant over .
