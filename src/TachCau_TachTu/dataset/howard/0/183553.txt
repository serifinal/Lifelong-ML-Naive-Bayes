international texting in virgin mobile .
i saw this on vm 's webiste ( http://www.virginmobileusa.com/mobil...text-messaging ) international text send and receive text messages with people on select carriers in over 170 countries worldwide .
to send an international text , enter 011 + the country code + the mobile number .
simple as that .
available on : all virgin mobile phones does anyone know what are those 170 countries and what are those select carriers ?
