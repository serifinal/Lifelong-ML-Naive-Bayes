t - mobile 3g faster than at&t ... .
since t - mobile has 3g in all it 's major markets could n't it brag locally that it has the fastest 3g for the time being ?
i herd vzw is the slowest 3g anywhere no matter what phone or kinda connection you have ... no ?
im not sure about sprint but since at&t is the " fastest " but not really , in nyc could n't t - mo take those bragging rights ?
if a speed test was done today in nyc against the iphone and whatever tmo device that gets the new 7.2 would n't tmobile come out on top ?
would n't that happen in a bunch of markets where at & t and tmobile both have 3g coverage ?
so even though at & t has the " fastest " network , it does n't perform that way and t - mobile would outshine it right ?
or am i wayyyy off ?
