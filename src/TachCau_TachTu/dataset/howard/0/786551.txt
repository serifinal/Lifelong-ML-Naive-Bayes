motorola droid x - screen failure issue .
while many of you are waiting for your droid x 's to be delivered i already returned mine .
i did the pre-order from best buy and picked it up 5 min after they opened on thursday .
that afternoon i noticed a line of dead pixels across the screen about 1/3 of the way down - they flickered in and out , but finally stayed on the rest of the evening .
this afternoon the bottom 1/2 of the screen went dead ... flickered a bit and just died , even when pulling the battery it only showed the bottom 1/2 of the motorola m on the boot screen .
took it back to best buy and they stated that i was the 3rd one returned today with the dead screen ... out of 6 they sold on launch day !!!!!! anyone else notice any screen issues ?
i have my name down for the next x they get in but am a bit hesitant to get one ... but i guess by the time the come in next week i can see if more people have this issue .
maybe time to start the `` droid x problem '' thread ... -------------------------------- edit by fauguy : if you are having screen problems of any kind , such as dead pixels or flickering , please post your build week .
i 'm wondering if it might all be from a bad batch .
