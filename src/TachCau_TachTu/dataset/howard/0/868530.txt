official fido customers getting the bell galaxy s ( vibrant ) .
samsung seems to be pushing the galaxy s series pretty hard .
since android is the one os that can currently battle the ios , this series is most likely the best out there to battle the iphone .
battery and power consumption seems to be the biggest concern out there these days .
this phone is the best offering for that out there .
samsung canada galaxy s page - http://pages.samsung.com/ca/galaxy/english/ bell mobility galaxy s page - http://galaxys.bell.ca/ hoping the fido users that have bought the htc legend directly from bell can chime in on this .
mainly because there might be some hurdles to overcome .
like where to get it unlocked ( if it needs unlocking ) .
if bell will sell it to you even though you 're not going to use it on their network
