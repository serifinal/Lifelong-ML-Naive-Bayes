service limited ? .
hi , i do nt know if you guys have this same thing on your accounts , but when i check into my boost account , in the right column , first line , under your account details where it says service status , it says service limited .
is this normal ?
my account does not seem limited at all , so i was wondering what this meant .
anybody have this also on their account ?
if not , what does it say on yours ?
