google nexus one : 3g for wind only .
for those interested in the highly anticipated `` google phone '' .
the specs were a bit fuzzy before , but it 's been confirm that it only has 3g for aws -lrb- t-mobile us and wind -rrb- .
so it wo n't work on telus or bell at all and only 2g on rogers/fido and at&t .
it 's also missing multi-touch .
