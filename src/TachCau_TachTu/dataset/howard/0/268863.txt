adding data plan to an existing voice plan [ iphone ] .
hey guys .
i am being offered an iphone 3gs from my buddy for a price i can not refuse . .
so i will be picking it up and looking into adding a data plan on top of my existing contract .
i called rogers and the rep told me that if i go with the $ 25 smartphone plan , i wo n't get the same speeds i would get on the 3g network with the ( minimum $ 60 ) iphone plan .
my question is : how true is this ?
i believe it , but why do they do this ?
is it a compatibility thing , or do they just tune down your speed so you get the iphone plan .
also , if true , how big of a drop is there in speed ?
is it a huge deal ?
i will be browsing websites , using apps , and streaming from youtube .
thanks in advance for any insight .
