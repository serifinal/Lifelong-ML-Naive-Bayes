my partner works for vzw corp. .
we have to do all upgrades/account changes online , ca n't do anything in store .
i 'm eligible on the employee account on my line for upgrade july 4 for upgrade at 2 year pricing .
does anyone know if i can call in to employee phone team and request they let me preorder for a phone ahead of time if the phones release date is on or after my upgrade date on the 4th ?
for example .
preorder starts fathers day which is june 20th .
i ca n't officially upgrade until july 4 .
can employee phone team -lrb- * 611 -rrb- allow me to preorder if the droid x 's release date is on or after the 4th , or do i have to wait til the 4th to preorder/order ?
my partner says he is n't sure the policy and said i should call in and ask .
figured i 'd ask here first ... anyone know ?
thanks for any help !
