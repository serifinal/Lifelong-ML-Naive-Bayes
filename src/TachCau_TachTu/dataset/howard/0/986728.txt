rogers smtp outgoing server question .
so i am trying to setup my defaul email app on my nexus one .
i am trying to get my shaw email to work .
i am using pop.shaw.ca for incoming , and i am using smtp.broadband.rogers.com for outgoing ( i do have wifi turned off ) now i can recieve my emails no problem but i cant send any , it always says connnection error .
is there a better smtp outgoing server i should be using ?
also when trying to use the standard shaw outgoing for when using wifi it wont even get past the setup part .
thanks !
