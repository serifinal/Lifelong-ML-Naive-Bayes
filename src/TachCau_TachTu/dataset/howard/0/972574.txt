witter users .
does your n900 make any noise when you receive a new tweet ? .
i have been through every setting i can find .
for some reason , i am only getting the quick banner notification ( about 3 seconds ) on the screen when i get a new tweet via witter .
can any witter users verify that they are getting an audible tone when they receive a new tweet .
i am getting tone , popup , and notification light when i get a new email .
