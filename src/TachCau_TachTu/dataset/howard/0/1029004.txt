question about 3gs purchase .
my dad had fido points . .
so he bought me an iphone 3gs with all this fido points . .
so around 700 $ in fido points for the iphone 3gs if i remember correctly . .
so today , they call my father and tell him he must take a 3 years contract for data only .... the 500mb 25 $ one .
but he clearly bought it for 700 $ with no contract . .
@ the applestore , you can get it for 700 $ no ?
are they trying to steal us money ( because we paid with fidodollars so it came like free , so they want to get some money from us ) or are they doing the right thing ?
fido is slowly becoming rogers
