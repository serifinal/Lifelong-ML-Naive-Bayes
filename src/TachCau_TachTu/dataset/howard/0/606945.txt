softbank network settings ?
( sms server , mobile internet ap , e-mail server ) .
i want to populate my nokia with softbank usim .
now it can only voicecall .
so i need original ( and hidden in sharp handset ) settings : 1 ) sms portal phone number 2 ) mobile internet access point ( the one that has upper limit of charge for " unlimited mobile internet pc site browsing " ~ $ 60 ) 3 ) settings for e - mail / s!mail ( is s!mail basically mms ?
or not ? )
how to send / receive s!mail via nokia handset .
i do n't need immediate receive of incoming mail , but if this could be done in pop3 / imap mode - that 's ok .
the problems are regional characters and t9 input on sharp phone .
on nokia i can install complete set of japanese fonts / codepage / input for symbian ( about ~ $ 15 for s / w package ) .
of course nokia is a piece of crap .
but this crap is useful for sms / mails in european - languages .
at least it can process " joint sms " .
