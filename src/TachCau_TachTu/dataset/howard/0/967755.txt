samsung wave coming to bell ! .
hey guys , looks like it 's been leaked - the samsung wave ( s8500 ) is coming to bell on july 8th !!
( google samsung wave bell for a whole bunch of info ! )
the price looks like it 's going to be $ 300 , regardless of contract length .
right now it 's retailing at independent stores for about $ 400 ... do you guys think the retail price is going to drop after the bell release ?
