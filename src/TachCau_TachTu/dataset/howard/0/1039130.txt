does your droid make a clicking noise when firmly pressing the right side ? .
if you have your droid closed , and you press the down firmly where the search button is located does your droid make a clicking noise like its hitting the top of the keyboard ?
when i push the right side of the phone firmly it makes the noise and feels looser ... .
is this because i took the plastic off the back of the keyboard ?
if i want to exchange at best buy should i use their insurance ?
if i do exchange should i just tell them it reboots in case they do nt want to replace because of this noise ?
or is this noise / touching normal ?
