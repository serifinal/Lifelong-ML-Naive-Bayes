t-mobile will launch hspa + smartphone in h2 2010 , 3x faster than sprint htc evo 4g .
source i know we all heard that t-mobile is going to be launching hspa + this year , but what really caught my eye about this article was that it said there will definitely be a high end phone coming from t-mobile before the end of the year .
no word on maker , specs , or os , but it gives me a glimmer of hope that there will be an android phone that is better than the g1 that has been the leader of t-mobile 's android pack since its release a year and a half ago .
