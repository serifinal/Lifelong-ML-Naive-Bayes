iphone in richmond hill , full signal , failed calls . .
is anyone else experiencing this or have experienced this ?
i have full bars , and i tried to select network to rogers or automatic the results are the same .
i make a call , takes 30 seconds to even hear the ring tone , then it 's choppy and will fail the call about 10 to 20 seconds into the call .
also , some attempts to call out have resulted in what appears to be crossing onto other lines as i hear choppy audio of other people talking to loud noises ?
i 'm not sure .
i 'm in richmond hill ontario area .
