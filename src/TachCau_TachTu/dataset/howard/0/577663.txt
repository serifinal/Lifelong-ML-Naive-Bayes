at&t iphone plan -lrb- includes unlimited data , corporate discount , and more ! -rrb- .
550 mins -lrb- 450 + 100 courtesy of customer care -rrb- | unlimited data | corporate discount | unlimited text | 5000 n&w mins | unlimited mobile to mobile if you are a new customer planning to purchase an iphone 4 on june 24th taking over a contract is the only way you 'll get access to unlimited data .
my contract is set to expire in december , but thanks to at&t 's leniency it is eligible for an upgrade early -lrb- effectively shortening the contract by 6 months -rrb- .
in other words this contract will be no longer than a new customer agreement .
the corporate discount is 15 % !
i 'm planning to downgrade to the 200 mb tier but i am sure there are new customers who would prefer an unlimited data plan .
i pulled 16 gigs one month without hearing a peep from at&t .
it is truly unlimited .
the transfer can be done completely online !
selling it for $ 300 .
get it while it lasts
