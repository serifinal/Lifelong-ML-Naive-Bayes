t - mobile android devices ( samsung vibrant ) .
i was wondering if we can start a new discussion section .
if possible and if moderators agree , the path should be ( home ) forum -- > us carrier discussion -- > t - mobile device discussion -- > android devices .
thanks in advance .
hofo moderators : feel free to delete this paragraph and start a new discussion if you wish .
with that said , i 'll start by saying ... i feel that t - mobile hase something huge planned .
one which they have quietly been keeping secret .
they will soon release the most powerful phone of all phones .
apple and its iphone has had its days in the limelight .
now , android phones will crush its competitor .
i woul not be surprised that rim and nokia will eventually release android driven devices .
so ... what do you think t - mobile will do next ?
sprint has the evo ... what will deutsche telekom do next ?
