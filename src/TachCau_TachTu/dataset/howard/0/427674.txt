paygo phone not receiving text messages .
hi all , i 'm on rogers pay - as - you - go with a 125 / mo text package ( with a balance of about 100 left , and some money left in the monthly balance expiring in january ) .
as it is , i can send texts to people no problem .
but receiving is a very different story .
when some people ( some on 711 speakout , others on rogers monthly ) send my texts , they do n't get a delivery report and i do n't get the message until very much later , when i get all the messages i was sent together at once .
this has happened multiple times .
does anyone know whats going on ?
thanks !
