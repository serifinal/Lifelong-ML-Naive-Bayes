paygo phone not receiving text messages .
hi all , i 'm on rogers pay-as-you-go with a 125/mo text package -lrb- with a balance of about 100 left , and some money left in the monthly balance expiring in january -rrb- .
as it is , i can send texts to people no problem .
but receiving is a very different story .
when some people -lrb- some on 711 speakout , others on rogers monthly -rrb- send my texts , they do n't get a delivery report and i do n't get the message until very much later , when i get all the messages i was sent together at once .
this has happened multiple times .
does anyone know whats going on ?
thanks !
