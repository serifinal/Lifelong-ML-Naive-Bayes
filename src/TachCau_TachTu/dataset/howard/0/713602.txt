motorola droid x firmware update ( .604 ) and hardware tracking thread .
use this thread to post the software version and date code of your droid x .
the x should come with firmware 1.13.516 but there is an over-the-air-update that ( should ) update it to .604 firmware .
if it does n't update you might want to try a factory reset , then have it check for the update you guys can post the date code on the back label if it differs from 25/10 ( week / year ) .
