fs : google nexus one ( at&t 850/1900 3g bands ) .
guys , i have a google nexus one for sale that has the at&t 3g bands .
it comes with the original box and accessories .
the phone has an invisible shield on the front .
there is a scuff mark on the back side of the phone on the lower left corner and a very very small scuff on the bottom right corner of the phone .
the phone works perfectly otherwise .
i ship to the us only and do n't take trades .
i take paypal payments .
i will be willing to sell this for $ 425 shipped due to the small scuffs .
the phone is sold as is and there are no returns .
please pm me if interested .
thanks , y2j
