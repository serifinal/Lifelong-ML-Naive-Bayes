thinking of ditching my inc for an evo .
service ?? .
i am stoked about my inc. .
the android system , sense , and even the phone quality are excellent .
my only problem is the screen size .
i just came from taking a close look at the hd2 .
the screen !
i want that screen !
that leads me to the evo .
who knows when the shadow really will be released and even then , it lacks sense .
here is my question : the sprint rep tells me that when roaming they use verizons towers ??
that should make coverage as good -lrb- or better ? -rrb-
than verizon .
my home looks to be in a roaming area .
any info on this would be of great help .
thanks !
