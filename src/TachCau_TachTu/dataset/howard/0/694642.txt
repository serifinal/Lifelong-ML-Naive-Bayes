adding extended family plan to existing account .
can anyone confirm if it is possible to add the extended family plan ( always shout for $ 25 ) to a existing wind account ?
i read on hofo this was not possible .
i called wind to confirm and they told me it is possible .
not sure if the wind call center rep was mistaken .
