page plus , outgoing smtp server .
i understand that google 's smtp server could be used , but i 'm wondering if there are any other options .
there seem to be few discussions of this here ( if you search for smpt in the pageplus forums anyway ) .
my current email provider does n't allow outgoing mail unless i 'm on their network ( which i suppose i could do via dialup ) .
is there a reliable smtp gateway for pageplus that does n't involve google ?
regards , hans
