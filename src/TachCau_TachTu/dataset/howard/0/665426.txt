iphone 4 micro-sim for bell .
so , everyone should be up to date regarding the iphone 4 news .
apparently it will have a micro sim card slot .
what does this mean for bell , and basically every other carrier out there ?
everyone has to adapt to apple 's requirements ( typical bs ) .
what should bell do about this ?
make it easier to swap between different sim cards ?
how would they go about doing that ?
thoughts ?
the only good thing out of this , would be the ability to pop your iphone 4 micro sim out and put it in a 3g ipad ( if it wo n't be locked to rogers ) .
but yeah , apple is just basically removing the ability to remove your sim card to try another phone out ....
