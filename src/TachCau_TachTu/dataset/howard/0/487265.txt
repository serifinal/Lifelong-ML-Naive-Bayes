can you still send and receive text messages without a specific text plan ? .
when i bought my nokia e71x with the 450 minutes and pda personal plan i was told that i would not be able to send or receive text messages unless i also purchased a texting plan so i bought one ( 200 texts for $ 5.00 ) .
would i be able to drop the the texting package and just pay - per - text or do i really have to have one ? .
