i got tired of low res icons from apps not yet updated ... so i did them myself ... .
just did bank of america , remote app and my google voice web shortcut .
i will get to them all later today !
i also changed my bite sms into the high res ip4 messages icon .
just take the " artwork " from the apps in itunes .
use gimp ( free open source photoshop alternative ) to size them to 150x150 pixels .
then save them as " icon.png " and ssh into your phone and copy the file into the .
app locations : / private / var / stash / applications < ------ apple & cydia apps / private / var / mobile / applications < ------ appstore apps / private / var / mobile / library / webclips < --- safari bookmark icons
