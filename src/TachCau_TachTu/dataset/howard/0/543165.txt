bb - iphone swap .
so my daughter had a bb and when i upgraded my 3g to a 3gs i gave her my 3g and my wife got the bb .
now she hates the iphone and wants her bb back .
so today we swapped the sims and gave my wife the 3g .
my question is this , she only uses data at home on the wifi and is a real technophobe .
we do n't want to add the $ 30 data plan since she will never use it .
are we running a risk of the phone `` calling home '' and using data when not on wifi .
last thing we want is to unknowingly incur a $ 100 + data charge .
is there a way to turn off data usage when not on wifi ?
