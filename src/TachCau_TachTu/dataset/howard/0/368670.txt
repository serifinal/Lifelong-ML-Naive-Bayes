iphone4 factory unlocked setup on telus questions ... .
thanks to a nationwide telus shortage of stock , i ended up getting a factory unlocked 32 gb iphone4 .
it arrives tomorrow ... .
now , i am a complete iphone illiterate !
i have no idea since this is a factory unlocked and not a telus version ... so if someone can help me out .
how difficult is it to set up to work on telus ?
i realize i will likely have to put all the telus data settings in somewhere , but since i have no iphone experience at all , i 'm not sure where to find to put them in .
i tried to look through the menus at best buy today on the demo and could n't find anything ( i know where to find the actual telus settings here in the forum ... that 's not what i am looking for ) anyway , if my iphone dumbness offends anyone , maybe someone can help me via pm ??
thanks in advance !
