damn you 3g in the philly area .
ok ... here is my issue .
been going on for about 2 weeks .
i get no 3g in the zip code 19038 .
only edge .
i am now not getting 3g in center city philadelphia .
so now i ca n't get 3g at home or at work .
this blows .
i called att a bunch of times .
finally there is a tower in my area that is `` degraded '' that is the word they used .
now i guess i will have to spend the rest of the day calling to get a ticket opened for the philly area .
anyone else having 3g issues ?
