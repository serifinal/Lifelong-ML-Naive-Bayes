default save location .
i 'm using nokia n86 .
i just downloaded wikitude from ovi store .
after downloading , it asks me where to install the program so i chose to the memory card .
the install was successful but now i want to delete the install file in c-drive .
it went down from 23mb to 15mb i think .
where is the default location for saving so i can delete it ?
