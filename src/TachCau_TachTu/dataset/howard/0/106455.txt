new solutions to the old question : can the camera flash be used as a torch ? .
hi guys , it 's quite obvious to mobile phone users that the powerful flash that their phones are equipped with can come very handy in the dark , if used as a flash .
i know people have been looking for ways to do this on nokia phones , where usually this is not a built - in function .
i also know there are several symbian / java applications out there that claim to be able to do this .
however the ones that i have tried ( ntorch , besttorch , spoton ) are either only able to use the * screen * for lighting , instead of the flash , or only able to turn on the red , low - powered light in the flash .
does anyone have a solution that will actually use the full power of the flash ?
thanks in advance for any suggestions .
