no multitasking .
so , i was going through a few apps and updating some things when i remembered that 4.0 multitasks now .
i never had the need for it but i double clicked my home button to find all these apps running in the multitasking dock .
i do n't want this to happen .
from what i know , if you run multiple apps in the background , it drains your battery .
i know apple said that their multitasking does n't do this but it still has to have an impact .
the phone icon shows down there , the sms message button shows down there , the calculator , etc. .
i do n't want any of these to be running - heck , i do n't want to multitask at all .
is there any way to shut this off or do i always have to delete an app from the multitasking dock when i 'm done with it ??
