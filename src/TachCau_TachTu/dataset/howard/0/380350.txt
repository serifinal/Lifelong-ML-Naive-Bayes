default location of icons .
trying to find out where the default location of icons are located on the phone .
rather than use a theme , i was wonder if its possible to ssh and update the icon / apps that i have .
i know using winterboard when a theme is selected it is located in / var / stash / theme / is there a location that i can upload icons if i am not using winterboard ??? winterboard slows the phone down so much .
thanks and any help is appreciated !
