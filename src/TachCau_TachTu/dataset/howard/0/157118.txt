i 've removed the posts about `` i ca n't order , it 's not showing up '' and `` i 've ordered mine '' .
we do n't need to bloat this thread with ` me too ' posts .
now if you have some type of question to ask about ordering or have an experience that you want to share `` i was n't allowed to upgrade '' or `` my local store was sold out '' , then that is ok .
