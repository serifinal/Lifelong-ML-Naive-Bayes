criket a100 outlook contact sync .
hey everyone , first post so here its goes ... .
just got two new criket a100 's for my office staff .
wondering how i can sync this with my outlook contacts ?
i have tried data sync but ca n't find 6.1 for free and im guessing that 's the only version that supports this model or the kyocera s1300 ?
also i have tried bitpim but also no luck even when i choose the `` other '' phone option .
i 'm sure this must be simple to do i just do n't know what to look for .
thanks @
