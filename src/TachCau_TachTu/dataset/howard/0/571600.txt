v551 ( cingular ) to work on t - mobile network ? .
hi everyone , and let just say i 'm new on here and to this extreme phone - tech stuff .
i was hoping that someone could help me with getting my old moto - v551 cingular phone to accept or work with a t - mobile sim chip .
i 've already lost time and money on scam sites to no avail .
thanks a whole lot for anything substantial leading to an actual working phone .
