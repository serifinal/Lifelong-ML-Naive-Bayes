strom bluetooth problem solved vista / 7 / xp .
i eventually got tired of searching and searching for those special blue - tooth drives that let you tether to your desktop and also use it for a / v control and even use your computer as a headset ( comp with mic ) .
av control will let you use your phone to play it on your computer etc same with videos .
i do nt think i need to go on and explain further .
if you do nt know what it is you do nt need it is the way i look at it .
okay now down to the sweet stuff , after days weeks etc of looking nothing found .
i had a spur of the moment idea to try broadcoms blue - tooth drivers ( auto find and update program ) .
it worked perfect .
i had to do none of that senseless computer management - > ports - > unknown device ( blue - tooth peripheral device ) rim v2 etc here it is the drivers for the strom v1 ( 9530 ) possibly all other blackberries .
let me know , well let everyone know post back if it works for you or not . ?
