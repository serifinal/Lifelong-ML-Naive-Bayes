i8350 pre-purchase questions .
i have been around here for years and i know the challenges for the other bb .
though i havent been ' caught ' up with the latest i would like to know if anything has changed since the 7700 bb with respect to the challenges it had on boost 's network .
1 .
does text work like any other phones ?
2 .
does email work like any other phones ?
3 .
internet ??
4 .
dc works im assuming im assuming there is no bis capabilities so i wo n't as that question .
do you need to get service books and jump through hoops to get it to work ?
all i want to do is have a good qwerty phone on boost without making crazy mods .
i have the i9 now . .
thank you in advance for your help .
it really means a lot .
