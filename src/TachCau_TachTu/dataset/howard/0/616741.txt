mms settings on wind .
just got the $ 40 unlimited big 3 killer plan haha .
i have a nexus one and want to use mms .
are there any special settings that you need to set to get it to work ?
i 've already added apn internet.windmobile.ca and can use data efficiently even tethering .
my mms 's do not send though , i 'm wondering how to fix this .
thanks
