sell/cancel/transfer a sero plan and port the number out of sprint ? .
i 've got a sero $ 30 plan that expires on may .
ideally i 'd like to cancel it and port my number to verizon .
however that would get me a $ 200 etf -lrb- according to retentions -rrb- .
is there any way i can take my number with my to verizon , and keep the sero plan active for the rest of the contract with another number or do a swap/give away the remainder of the account to someone and get a new number for them ?
