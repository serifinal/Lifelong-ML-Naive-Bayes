ft : bnib rogers 9700 bold for bnib rogers iphone 3gs 16 gb or mint used 32 gb .
anyone interested in trading their bnib rogers iphone 3gs 16 gb for a bnib rogers 9700 bold ?
your 16 gb iphone 3gs must be brand new sealed , and it must be from rogers .
proof of activation must be shown with matching imei as i will provide the same for my 9700 .
if you have a rogers 32 gb 3gs , it must be in absolutely mint condition ( i 'm very meticulous ) , and with a good length of warranty remaining on the phone .
i prefer black iphones .
no fido iphones .
face - to - face transaction only !
i 'm located in scarborough .
cheers .
