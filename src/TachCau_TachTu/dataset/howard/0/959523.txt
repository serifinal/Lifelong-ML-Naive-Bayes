samsung kies wo n't recognize samsung vibrant :( .
bought the samsung vibrant from bell about a week ago and i did n't really bother with samsung kies and always just used the mass storage mode .
but now that i heard there 's a new firmware update that fixes the gps and increases the battery a bit i need to use samsung kies to update .
crappy thing is everytime i try to use it kies will just get stuck on " connecting the device ... please wait " .
does anyone have a solution for that ?
