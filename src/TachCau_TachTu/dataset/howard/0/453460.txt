samsung vibrant - t - mobile * and * att 3g - capable ! .
according to a thread over at xda - developers , the samsung vibrant for t - mobile supports 1900mhz umts / 3g .
this would be the first phone sold by t - mobile that supports att 3g as well as on its own aws band .
i did n't believe it when it was first posted , but it seems to hold up to scrutiny , as the user posted a screenshot of a speed test result which includes an att ( cingular ) ip address for the device , as well as 3g speeds and att 's trademark high 3g latency .
further proof : http://www.vimeo.com/13641477 so , now the question is : if the vibrant and captivate are practically identical hard - ware wise , is it possible that the captivate is using the same radio , and itself supports t - mobile 3g on the aws ( 1700 ) band ?
