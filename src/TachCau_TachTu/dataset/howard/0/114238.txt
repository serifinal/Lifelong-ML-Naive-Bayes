web store order - calling in to confirm cc # ? .
i ordered a phone from the web store over the weekend , and on monday i received an e-mail from a `` web store administrator '' saying i need to call in to confirm credit card info and address .
well i did and i gave him the cc # after some hesitation because the timing was perfect and the phone number had an elaborate , `` authentic '' sounding voice mail system .
the original order confirmation e-mail did say they might e-mail/call to confirm credit history or credit card info .
so does telus really do this ?
or does this sound like a scam to you ?
the number i called is a 1-866 number not found on their web site .
edit : the number i called was 1-866-488-2709 which seems to be legit judging from this post : http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php?t=1622445 but seriously , wth ?
