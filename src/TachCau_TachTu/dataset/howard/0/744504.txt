for apple / att : the great thing about facetime , video calling feature ... .
is that it 's going to make people buy iphone 4 's in quantities of two or more .
since facetime , is exclusive to the latest iphone , you 'll need other iphone 4 's to make use of it .
i can see people who are really into video calling , buying one for themselves as well as their wives , girlfriends , kids , grandparents etc. .
in the past you could upgrade each phone on the family plan one at a time but this new feature begs you to buy multiple phones so that you can use it .
it 's no fun to have video calling if no one else can do it .
this will mean that att / apple will sell even more of these things and make even more money .
