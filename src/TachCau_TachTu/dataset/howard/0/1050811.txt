us treasury : " when can we have a public review of your structure ? "
fed : " never . " .
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?p...d=adjvxg1zp.zy the federal reserve board has rejected a request by u.s. treasury secretary timothy geithner for a public review of the central bank?s structure and governance , three people familiar with the matter said .
the obama administration proposed on june 17 a financial - regulatory overhaul including a ?
comprehensive review ?
of the fed?s ?
ability to accomplish its existing and proposed functions ?
and the role of its regional banks .
the fed was to lead the study and enlist the treasury and ?
a wide range of external experts . ? ?
it is not obvious at all why that is a treasury responsibility or even appropriate why the treasury would undertake that kind of study , ?
said robert eisenbeis , chief monetary economist at cumberland advisors inc. in vineland , new jersey , and a former atlanta fed research director . ?
the fed was created by congress and it is not part of the executive branch . ?
so congress can audit the fed then ?
