help with bell plan with a samsung galaxy s vibrant .
i 'm wondering if someone can help me out - bell 's site does n't seem to have all the options and i want to know what i 'm talking about before i go into the store .
i 'd like to have the following : unlimited five , calling and text to / from 5 # s nationwide text : unlimited or 500 out / unlimited in mms ?
$ 30 6 gb plan + $ 10 ipad sharing voicemail and caller id the " regular " or evening / weekend mins do n't matter much because it will be almost al covered with the unlimited five package .
any help would be great , i am a new customer and have no plan with any carrier .
