cv / mobile video with cnn , fox , espn , etc now free with unlimited data plan ?? .
hi i have n't posted here in quite awhile so i 'm a little rusty on the latest juicy gossip but i did receive a free at&t alert on my phone today blabbing on about how cv was now being called " mobile video " and was available to customers with smartphones and an unlimited data plan ( i have both ) .
in the faq section of their cv / mobile video site under " what does it cost ? "
all it said was that you needed an unlimited data plan ( $ 30.00 ) but no mention ( to my knowledge ) of having to pay a subscription fee .
i remember some time ago that you used to have to pay $ 9.99 per month for a access to mobile video like cnn , fox , espn and a number of other channels but apparently now it 's free ?? .
i tried it out on my nokia e71x and i was able to view these channels and watch videos with no problem - nor did i get any messages asking me to sign up or that there was a subscription fee being charged .
so is cv / mobile video ( which used to cost $ 9.99 per month ) now free ? .
has anyone else gotten an at&t alert pertaining to this ? .
