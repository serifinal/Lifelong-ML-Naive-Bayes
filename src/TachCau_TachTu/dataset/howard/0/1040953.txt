does the droid allow for long text messages ? .
so i 've read about every review site as possible and none have addressed this issue .
went ahead and placed the order and will receive it monday .
my question is does it allow for ems -lrb- receiving messages longer than 160 characters and sending messages longer than 160 characters to other vz subscribers -rrb- .
all feature phones -lrb- aka dumbphones -rrb- allow this but i 've yet to find a smart phone capable of this .
it 's not a deal breaker since my bb did n't have it but it certainly would be nice
