samsung galaxy s vibrant reception , does yours do this too ? .
my phone sometimes cuts out at work ( which my old one did too ) ... but the vibrant sometimes have no reception ( the blue crossed out symbol appears ) ... but the thing that sucks is that it takes several minutes sometimes to get reception back .
just now , i looked that my phone had no reception , so i went outside and stayed that way for atleast one minute , or more .
when i 'm in an area that has no reception , then enter a strong signal are , why does it still take the phone over 1 minute to realize that there is reception now ?
i do n't get this phone ... ( btw - the reception on this phone is worst than my 3 year old htc touch )
