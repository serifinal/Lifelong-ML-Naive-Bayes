droid crashes my wifi network . .
every single time i use wifi at home on my droid 30-45 minutes later , my network will crash .
i 'm using an apple airport extreme router .
i 'm almost positive its my droid thats causing it to crash .
i can go days without using my droid on wifi and my network is fine .
as soon as i access wifi , it crashes , and i have to reboot my modem and router .
is there certain ports i need to allow access to on my router ?
settings i need to change ?
any help is appreciated .
thanks .
