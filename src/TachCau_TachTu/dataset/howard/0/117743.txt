nokia 5800 music vs 5800 nav ?
cameras .
are the builds of these 2 phones different ?
my brother got the nav edition from amazon 2 weeks ago and i just received my music ed .
from dell today .
my main concern is the camera .
i know that the cameras between the e71 -lrb- unlocked -rrb- and e71x -lrb- att -rrb- are different and you can tell by looking at the lens with a light shined on it .
the e71x shines green .
well my brothers 5800 nav ed .
shines green while my 5800 music ed .
does not .
is this something i should worry about ?
are the cams different ?
