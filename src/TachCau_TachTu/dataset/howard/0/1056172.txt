family plan with data .
hi everyone , my wife and i are looking for the best cell phone plan for our needs .
currently : her : lg xenon locked to fido on $ 10 monthly prepaid .
using for voice only and buying the occasional $ 1 daily data pass .
me : nothing right now .
changes : i 'll be getting a bb 9700 as a gift - locked to rogers but bought without a contract .
she would would like to get some basic data usage on her xenon for twitter , minimal web browsing , etc. .
unfortunately , fido does n't allow the $ 10 browsing add-on for a prepaid .
also , we would like to consolidate on to one family plan bill since i can likely expense both phones at work , but only if on one plan .
however , not many family share plans have a data add-on .
leading option : $ 100 rogers family share plan 1gb shared data -lrb- should be more than enough for my expected bb use and her xenon browsing -rrb- have her xenon unlocked so she can function on rogers network questions : 1 .
what are your thoughts on this family plan , or are there better alternatives with data ?
2 .
will fido provide an unlock code for a xenon that is not on a contract and that we would migrate over to rogers anyways -lrb- all one company , and they win by getting her on a postpaid family plan -rrb- .
3 .
any other issues you guys see with going this route ?
appreciate any insight you might all have .
much appreciated !
josh
