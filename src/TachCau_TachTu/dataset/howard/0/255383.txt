galaxy s vibrant not compatible with mobile sports tv .
hi all , i finally got a galaxy s vibrant from bell , free at costco ( 150 $ - 100 $ in stores rebates - 50 $ on my bill because i have 3 services with bell ) + i got the student plans for 50 $ .
i call csr yesterday to add mobile sports tv but was unable to use it , said it 's not compatible with my profile .
i call technical support and they said because mobile sports tv is not compatible with my phones , so i remove it .
anyone here have an idea when it will be compatible ?
