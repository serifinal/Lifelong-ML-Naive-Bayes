new ' extended coverage ' on coverage maps .
all of a sudden bell has added a sub-category to it 's new hspa network map .
a so - called extended coverage has section which covers a large majority of the prairies and some parts on ontario .
quoted beneath the new refurbished coverage map is a disclaimer " roaming partners ' hspa and gsm / edge coverage in certain parts of manitoba and saskatchewan .
speed may vary due to topography , environmental conditions , device type and other factors . "
so basically as i understand it this new " extended coverage " is n't hspa at all , it 's old 2g gsm / edge network , haha .
so what i 'm concerned about is bell advertising it as hspa , and the future hspa coverage zones ( specifically in northern ontario ) to be filled with sub-par old technology which is n't fast at all .
sure it 's great they have coverage all over the prairies now , but it 's the wrong kind of coverage .
i think it 's unethical to label this extended coverage hspa when it 's really gsm ... come on bell , pull your heads out of your , well you know your thoughts ... ?
