samsung vibrant on a family plan with no data .
i 'm hoping someone was in the same boat as me and can answer a quick question .
i have a family plan with 600 shared minutes and unlimited text on 3 lines .
i just added the preferred android plan to my 1st line and got a vibrant for it .
one of my other lines is eligible for a phone upgrade and i was wondering if i can get a second vibrant without paying for data ( wifi use only ) .
since my unlimited text plan costs $ 14.99 a month will they let me get the phone discount without requiring me to get a data plan on my extra line ?
i want the phone i just do n't use data that much and wi - fi only will work for me .
has anyone done this or tried it ?
