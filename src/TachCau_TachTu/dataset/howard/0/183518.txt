quick questions before upgrading/re-jailbreaking .
currently using a jailbroken 3g , version 3.0 , firmware 04.26.08 , and itunes 8 .
it 's been a long time since i 've needed to upgrade the software and looking at the forums and some of the guides -lrb- till my head was spinning -rrb- things have really changed .
do n't really care about unlocking the phone so much but definitely need cydia and tethering capability .
couple of hopefully quick and easy questions ... 1 -rrb- i 've download version 3.1.2 .
do i need to restore the phone to a clean version of 3.0 first or just restore using 3.1.2 then jailbreak ?
i know if you did things in the wrong order before you 'd lose 500mb or so of space .
2 -rrb- i used to use qckpwn -lrb- sp ? -rrb-
but most of the guides i 'm seeing now suggest blackrain .
which is better or does it matter ?
any help/suggestions would be appreciated .
i 've held off upgrading but some of the apps i want just wo n't work on 3.0 anymore .
