what 's faster on a laptop : iphone 3gs tether or sierra wireless 306 key ? .
a family member is looking to have internet on the go with their laptop for their main purpose , and potentially may be interested in going the cell phone tethering route depending on a few things .
i 'm trying to help and find out what 's generally faster ?
the new sierra 306 mobile internet key for the " 3g + " network or iphone 3gs tether ?
is the 3gs basically one of the faster tethering phones ?
i 'm on rogers so i do n't even know if the 3gs is built to max out our ( rogers ' ) supposed " 7.2 speeds " or if the 3g is built to go faster passed that , given there 's a network that is faster ( telus / bell @ 21 mbps ) ?
so , this whole new similar network is confusing to me , plus i do n't know which devices are actually built to utilize the most speed possible .
a little clarification is needed and appreciate anyone who can help .
