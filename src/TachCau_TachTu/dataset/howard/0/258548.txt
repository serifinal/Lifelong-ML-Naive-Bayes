getting unlimited data on a prepaid account with a smartphone . .
ive actually tried this and it seems to work .
i recently bought a blackberry pearl flip ( rogers ) from kajiji and stuck my pay as you go sim card into it .
on the sim card , i have unlimited on device browsing and the 1 cent talk and text plan i was surprised to see that upon opening the icon labeled ' rogers mall ' , it allowed me to completely surf the internet on the flip without occurring additional charges to my pre-paid account and even downloads seem to work .
has anyone else managed to do this ?
maybe its a glitch in the system because i do n't believe this is suppose to happen .
