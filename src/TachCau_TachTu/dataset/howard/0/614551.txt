my bb 9700 drops calls because it 's a decepticon ?! .
title is in jest , but please tell me if any of you are experiencing the same problem ( which i 've had since launch ) : you 're on the phone , network is flawless ( or not ) , then after about 3 - 4 mins the line goes dead silent , presumably from signal loss / network switching .
five to ten seconds later , it sounds as if all your friend 's words that were " clogged " come rushing out through the earpiece at once in a few hundred milliseconds .
if you 've watched transformers , it sounds exactly like frenzy speaking in the decepticon language , cybertronian .
i 'm dead serious .
it 's funny because it 's so ludicrous , but annoying because my call gets dropped .
this does n't happen every time ( sometimes the phone just cuts with " call failed " , or i get impatient and disconnect first ) but it 's generally what i experience on calls lasting longer than three minutes .
