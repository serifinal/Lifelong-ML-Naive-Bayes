getting tired .
ok , so i exchanged the blackberry for the rumor touch thinking at least i 'd have a twitter app .
so i downloaded the twitter app and opera mini 5 .
opera mini works fine .
the twitter app just loads and says " a network error has occured .
please try again later could not connect .
anyone else have the twitter app working on the rumor touch ?
