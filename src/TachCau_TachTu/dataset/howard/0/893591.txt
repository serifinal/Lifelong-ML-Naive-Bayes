bell turbo hub ( w35 ) speed issue .
any one have data speed issues ?
i use to get 4 - 5 mb down and 1.2 - 2.3 mb up .
now i have a hard time to pass 2mb down and .5 up !!!
same signal strenth checked my external antenna all seem well .
i think they are testing hspa +4 x mb i wonder if it can be that .
