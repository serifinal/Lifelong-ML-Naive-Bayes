about t - mobile internet and exchange server .
i have this issue for some reason with t - mobile internet and the exchange server i can use wifi to send and recieve emails find out of my server , but when i use t - mobile internet i can only recieve emails fine , but can not send emails out .
it gives the error of send failure also i have an inbox with more subfolders under it to reorganize my emails and such .
all my folders except one has an issue of no recipient .
i keep getting emails daily that are not " new " but read but all have under the email of no recipient .
all my other email folders do nt have this issue just that one with one particular person .
now that particular person can send me other emails and it would have her name on it .
