switching from voice only plan to iphone voice / data plan , then back to voice only . .
i tried asking this question a few days ago , but i did n't explain my question very clearly , so i will try again now .
i am currently with vzw , not at&t , and have no plans of switching to at&t , since i just left them .
but , i miss having an iphone .
hated the voice service , but loved the usability of the phone when connected to wifi .
my soon - to - be wife 's family are all on the same family plan , and i believe 3 of the lines are available for upgrade .
my soon - to - be father - in - law is a complete technotard , and has absolutely no interest in upgrading from his simple samsung flip phone .
so , here is my question : can he upgrade his line from a voice only plan to a voice / data plan and get the new iphone 4 , then switch back to his voice only plan with his samsung flip without penalty ?
i would take the iphone 4 and use it as a wifi only device .
i realize that the micro-sim could be an issue , would at&t reactivate his old sim card to use with his samsung ?
