new proxy server for internet over metropcs ? .
is there a new proxy server required for internet over metropcs ?
i tried tethering today and got a message that the proxy server is " busy or unavailable " .
i tried looking for wap.metropcs.net on my desktop and found that there is no dns entry for it .
internet on the dinky little phone still works , so i tend to conclude that the proxy server is no longer wap.metropcs.net port 3128 .
