seriously !!
the advantage and disadvantage of page plus v / s straight talk .
what are the true advantages that page plus have over straight talk ?
i seen alot of people in the area i live in leave page plus to go with straight talk .
it got me wondering .... i know the roaming issue .
what else ?
people telling me that straight talk is just as good , besides the roaming issue .
i also know you can bring some phones to page plus and none to straight talk .
im thinking of jumping over to st also due to the unlimited web .
