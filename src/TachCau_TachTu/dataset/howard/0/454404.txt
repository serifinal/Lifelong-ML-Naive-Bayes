family share plan for a business account .
i have a question about the family talk share plans .
here is the situation .
i work for a small business , we currently have 13 cellphones with sprint and 1 with at&t .
we are reducing the number of phones to 5 .
thus we will be moving 4 from sprint to at&t .
the one phone with sprint is currently on a unlimited plan , which is billed to the company .
the business rep has suggested , 2 phones on a 3000 minute plan ( $ 140 ) with roll over and 2 phones on a second 3000 minute plan ( $ 140 ) with roll over and leavng the curent phone alone ( $ 99 ) .
all this on the businees shared plans .
so $ 379 .
i have come across the family share plans , there is an unlimited share for 119 , 2 lines and 49 each for the next three lines .
this would be much chaeper and provided unlimited minutes .
so 5 lines would be 266 .
plus for $ 30 you can get unlimited txt for all 5 on the plan so as a business can we get a family share plan ??
