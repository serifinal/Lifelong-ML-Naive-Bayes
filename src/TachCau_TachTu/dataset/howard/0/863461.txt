iblipped app shows real carrier coverage maps .
http://crackberry.com/iblipped-app-s...-coverage-maps given the recent ad campaign of verizon , and at&t 's subsequent lawsuit , iblipped could not have better timing .
the application is totally free , an essentially creates real carrier coverage maps based on user data .
it gathers data based on signal strength and dead zones , and compiles the data to create real coverage maps .
iblipped uses volunteered data , so the more people that use it the better .
it works on any gps enabled device , both gsm or cdma .
calling up blips , you start out seeing a page that is acquiring sattelites .
pressing the blackberry button yeilds the options menu .
allowing you to set options such as recording mode , either distance ( good for driving ) or time ( good for walking ) .
when you are done collecting your data , press the blackberry button , then press upload files .
pressing the end button sends the blips program to the background where it continues to collect data while you go about your travels .
your data will show on our maps within 24 hours ( but usually overnight if you get your files in before 9 pm ) .
so if you are going across town or across country , iblipped.com needs your help to succeed .
i think this is a very cool app , especially for free , that over time will provide a great deal of data that could help improve networks .
