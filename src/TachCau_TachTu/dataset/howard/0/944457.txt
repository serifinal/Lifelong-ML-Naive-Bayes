bell samsung galaxy s i9000 $ 100 on 3 yr + free $ 75 gc + 3300 ( $ 41 ) reward points at bb .
repost from flintblade at rfd originally posted by flintblade bestbuy has the samsung galaxy s i9000 on sale for $ 100 on a 3 yr contract .
you also get a free $ 75 gc and 2500 points + an additional 800 points while purchasing it during the back to school event .
400 points = $ 5 so that 's $ 41.25 on top of the $ 50 savings and $ 75 gc futureshop also has the phone on sale but it 's $ 150 with a $ 100 gc and no reward points .
you may be able to get something to compensate for the loss in reward points though .
the gift card ca n't be used on the purchase of the phone , but you can sell it at a 10 % loss on rfd if you have nothing else to buy .
