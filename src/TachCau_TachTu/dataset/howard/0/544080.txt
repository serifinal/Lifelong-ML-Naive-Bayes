100 long distance minutes + 100 local minutes = 100 north american minutes .
i 've been with telus since the clearnet days and had ( up until now ) always understood my long distance minutes to be separate from my local minutes .
this month i managed to use up my 100 local minutes , but thought i was safe to still make some long distance calls only to discover them being charged as overages .
a call to telus clarified that if you make a call during the daytime , they take that airtime out of both your long distance and local minutes .
was this supposed to be common knowledge ?
am i the only one who thinks the advertising suggests two pools of minutes ?
