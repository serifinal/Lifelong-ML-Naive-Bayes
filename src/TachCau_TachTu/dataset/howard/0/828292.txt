wind is now refusing to do anything more about ports .
everytime i read a post from graham i want to scream .
wind is really turning out to be worse than the big 3 ... .
in response to a post today on the wind comments forum about continued port blocking and no sip access this was posted ! "
@droidhacker thank you for your post .
chris wrote a blog a few weeks ago that addressed what we are currently prepared to do when it comes to ports .
http://www.windmobile.ca/community/w...ata-ports-fix/ although i realize this will not satisfy your request to open up all ports , chris lists some reasons why ports might remain closed .
i can tell you that streaming and tethering on the blackberry is currently in the process of being tested .
we hope to have some good news on this front in the next 30 days .
again i realize this is not the news you want to hear , but the changes chris listed in his post opened up the ports that the vast majority of our customers use .
i will forward your post to the right people to ensure we consider all of our customer needs in our plans .
thank you again for your post graham " so basically wind is saying f u , that 's all the ports we are ever going to open , and oh btw it will take another month to fix blackberry tethering .... wtf are they doing over there - man i feel bad for you blackberry users how do we all give wind the message ?
leaving for dave ?
it 's almost like they do n't give a **** about us early adopters , we are the guinea pigs that they can use to test their network while they expand nation wide , guinea pigs who are paying them to work for them ... what a great deal for wind , and hey if 75 % of us leave when they finally roll out nationwide with a reiable network they can just blitz the media again to get new customers
