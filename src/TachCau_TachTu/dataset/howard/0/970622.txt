droid drops calls when switches to 3g .
moto droid cricket flashed user here .
i 've had this phone for couple months now .
the 1st month it was super smooth .
now it consitantly drops calls .
sometimes i ca n't even call out , the moment i hear the ring tone it drops .
i have missed many important phone calls and important text .
yes i do n't get all text too .
it 's so frustrating .
i miss my bb storm so much right now now , this is what i notice .
when i dial out it 's not in 3g , it just shows the bars .
so when i am talking it 's still has the bars and no 3g .
but when the phone switches to 3g mode that 's when it drops ... it does that everytime , when it swtiches to 3g i get disconnected .
the firmware is still 2.0.1 .
it asked to update to 2.1 and i said yes .
it went through the process of downloading and shutting down but it 's still on 2.0.1 .
my baseband version is still c_01 .3 e. 01p .
i tried switching the mode network type to evdo for 1x service but it switches back to 3g and it still drops my calls ... .
any suggestion ?
anyone encounter this ?
thanks in advance for help .
