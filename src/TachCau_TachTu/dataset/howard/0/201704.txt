dashwire : seamless integration & multiple real world uses . .
try it !! .
hey all ; just decided to d / l this programme right now and find it allows for great remote access to phone functions ; 1 ) send and receive sms / txt from your computer without picking up your phone ( threaded by conversation ) 2 ) automatically upload photos and videos captured on the go to easily organize and share with your friends 3 ) add an address book contact on your computer and have it instantly appear on your phone 4 ) easily set internet favorites , ringtones , wallpapers , and speed dials ?
in seconds from your computer 5 ) single click media upload to facebook , flickr , friendfeed , twitter & bebo 6 ) update your status on facebook & twitter 7 ) visual voicemail on your computer ( or as i call it , power vvm ) i do nt usually try these progs until i read more about in on hofo but this time i couldnt resist ; you control which items sync and when it happens .
dashwire connects across wireless data , wi - fi , bluetooth , and usb .
simple registration process , 1 .
cab file onto phone memory ( would prefer external memory but hey . . )
, 2 .
register with minimum details ( email , phone , and password ) 3 .
run the 1st sync 4 .
modify privacy seting , s sync options , etc etc 5 .
enjoy . . !!
links http://dashwire.com/ direct link from phone ; http://m.dashwire.com/ although you have the option of manual or auto sync options ; this does require huge data transfers back n forth so adapt your data plans ( or data use accordingly ) or only use in a wifi zone .
nb : presently this prog runs on wm5 & wm6 & symbian os ( symbian in private beta ) , upcoming versions according to the site will run on android , bb , and sybian s60 3rd edition too ... nbb : no affiliation with this site ; just want to share w / hofo community .
