official unlock thread for nam motorola milestone -lrb- telus -rrb- .
do n't know if this is more appropriate for the telus hspa forum or motorola .
i 'm going with motorola because it 's about unlocking the milestone to use elsewhere .
please post in here if you obtained an unlock code for a telus milestone and it worked .
even better would be a screenshot or photo/video of the screen , showing your milestone is running on a non-telus operator -lrb- double bonus if it shows 3g/hspa reception -rrb- .
let us know if there were any specific options you had to choose when buying the unlock code to make sure it 's for the correct milestone .
please * also * post in here if the unlock code * did n't * work and let us know who sold you the lemon .
