engadget : nokia 's design by community makes smartphone concepting a multiplayer game , with limits nokia 's community blog has opened up the crowdsourcing floodgates , at least in theory .
for " design by community , " users will be able to vote on smartphone features via a series of sliders , although within an arbitrary point allotment system .
a new poll opens next week for size and shape , followed by materials , operating system ( symbian or meego being the only choices , unsurprisingly ) , and so on in the weeks that follow , with the last poll starting april 26th .
after that , a concept sketch will be voted on and later rendered -- but no plans to ever have it made into an actual retail product ( boo ) .
we ca n't exactly say we understand all the selections here : why is a touchscreen keyboard less ambitious than t9 text entry ?
does saying capacitive is more ambitious than resistive serve as a subtle hint of trends to come ?
what in the world is the difference between hot key and one touch ?
it 's interesting to see how x6 , n900 , n97 all come out as a perfect mixes , while last year 's e75 and the more recent c5 all straddle the " less than ambitious " line .
oh , and just so we 're clear ... a 5 - inch , 21:9 ratio display without touchscreen but with a touchscreen keyboard is a perfect mix .
go figure .
