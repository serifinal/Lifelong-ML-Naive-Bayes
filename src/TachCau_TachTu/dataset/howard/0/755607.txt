video recording on incredible .
i have some questions about video recording on the incredible .
what is the difference between h. 263 , h. 264 and mpeg4 ??
i am not sure which to use for the smoothest playback on my phone and computer / ipad .
also , do the 3 different resolutions offered ( 1280 x 720 , 800 x 480 and 640 x 480 ) all have the same fps rate , or are they different .
i do n't mind recording at 640 x 480 if it 's going to give me the smoothest video .
thanks for any help and insight .
