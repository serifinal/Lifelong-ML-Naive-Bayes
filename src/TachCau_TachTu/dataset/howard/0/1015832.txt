video out works great on the tp . .
i just got my order of my tp video cable in today , ( ordered on saturday , damn fast shipping ) , and i 'm using it right now to watch " lord of war " on my hdtv , and the quality is great .
now i 'll have a portable computer wherever i am .
all i need is a foldable bluetooth keyboard and mouse , and as long as i have a tv available with rca inputs , i 'll be able to use my phone as a desktop computer .
( i could now , but it kind of sucks using that small keyboard when i have a 23 " widescreen hdtv ) .
now all i need to find is a holster that will carry my tp , the video cable , the ac charger , and a sync cable .
is there a holster like this available , or will i be into fanny pack territory ?
