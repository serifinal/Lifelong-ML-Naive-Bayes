did apple really do multitasking right or did they just wait 'til they could ... .
build an iphone with a more efficient processor and a much bigger battery ?
i think it 's the latter .
i 'm just going off on the fact i have had ios4 on my 3gs for a couple of days and it 's an absolute energy vampire .
apple said that they waited on multitasking because they wanted to do it right and that gives you the impression that the " doing it right " was on the software end .
but it does not seem that they did it right as they put it based on my experience using the 3gs .
it looks like they just waited 'til it was technically possible hardware wise to get a more efficient processor and shoehorn in a much bigger battery before putting in multitasking .
any new iphone 4 users who would care to come back to this thread and give their impression on the new phone and it 's battery life , would be greatly appreciated .
