adding voice feature to ipad plan .
hi i am using my ipad micro sim in my iphone 3gs and i want to add voice to my phone line with bell .
so far i have topped up my pre-paid phone $ 15 from the self-serve area and i still can not make voice calls , but i can call 611 etc. .
i just keep getting `` your call can not be completed as dial '' error when calling valid numbers .
are there any bell employees who can help ?
or someone who might know how to active this feature .
thanks .
