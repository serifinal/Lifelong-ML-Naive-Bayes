is there a verizon plan similar to sprint family data share plan ? .
sprint has a family plan for $ 130 that has 1500 minutes , unlimited texting , and includes data for smart phones .
with verizon there are family plans that include the minutes and texting but the smart phones are extra .
i think its $ 100 for a 700 minute unlimited texting and $ 30 for data .
with multiple data devices , the sprint plans are a lot cheaper .
does verizon plan on having something to compete with this ?
i 'd think that with more people getting smart phones they would want something .
thanks , josh
