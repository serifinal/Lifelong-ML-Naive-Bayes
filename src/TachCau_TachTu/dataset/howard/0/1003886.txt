why i 'm returning my samsung vibrant ... .
after considerable thought , i have decided to return my phone .
despite the beautiful screen and screaming fast processor , the device has some issues that i ultimately couldn?t rationalize .
1 .
samsung touchwiz ui was a bit buggy which inhibited the android os performance .
sometimes apps wouldn?t load properly or perform slowly .
os would get stuck sometimes , etc. .
experience was n't horrible , but not the performance i expected .
2 .
handset didn?t transition well between edge and 3g .
had problems when emerging from subways , etc. .
building penetration was also a bit suspect .
3 .
gps was terrible .
probably a hardware issue .
just wasn?t sensitive enough .
had difficulty logging on to my location .
4 .
no led indicator for message notification .
such a small oversight ? .
but really annoying not to have .
5 .
i miss the trackball .
i found my old trackball helpful when writing , especially when noticing a spelling mistake .
i did n't mind the lack of a camera flash or a front facing camera .
the phone just did n't perform up to my expectation .
it 's too bad because i was counting the days until this phone was launched .
( i even went to the launch party in nyc ) .
oh well ... by the way , for those of you wondering ... i did reset my handset .
