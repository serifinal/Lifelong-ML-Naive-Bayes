blackberry torch 9800 .
so far there has been word that bell , telus and rogers will get the bb torch ( portrait slider keyboard + touch screen ) eventually , while at&t will get some period of us exclusivity and an early launch .
i have reliable information that the 9800 radio is identical to the 9700 's .
at time of manufacturing , an irreversible firmware change is made that locks it into either umts 850 / 1900/2100 or umts 900 / aws / 2100 .
except in the case of dev phones which can be set to penta - band , or can be reflashed to the other bands .
so ... it is technically feasible for an aws - compatible torch to come out on wind .
any chance it 'll happen ?
