receiving old text messages .
hello , a friend of mine has an iphone and i regularly send text messages to him via xxxxxxxxxx@txt.att.net , from my work email server .
last weekend or so i received failure notices from cingularme.com .
now he receives several old text ( maybe 3 months old ) every time i send a new text from my email .
i suspect some changes were made on att side and now he has some old texts that are stuck on his account .
i am the email administrator for my domain and things look fine on my exchange server .
any ideas on how to correct this issue ?
