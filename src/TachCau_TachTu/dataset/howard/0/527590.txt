can the samsung r451 sync with outlook ? .
i am looking to dump verizon mid-contract to save with straight talk 's unltd plan .
i am in the 14519 area code and the r451 looks like my best option but when i ask st if i can sync it i get the feeling they do n't know what i am talking about .
since i get the tech run - around with verizon this is n't any different , but i do need to sync to outlook with ease .
thanks for the help .
