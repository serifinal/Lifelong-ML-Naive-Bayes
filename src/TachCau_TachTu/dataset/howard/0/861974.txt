is there an unlimited data plan for the new iphone ? .
not impressed with the 1 , 2 , 3 gb data plans .
after testing out the new canadian sirius app on my buddy 's iphone , we calculated that it requires 2mb / min to operate .
is there an unlimited data plan that isnt advertised but possible to get ?
