any disadvantage to itunes 9 ? .
hi there , after reading a bunch of posts about not upgrading to 3.1 , i decided 3.0.1 might be a better bet .
i 'm not really planning on unlocking , but if it 'll help resale value , then i 'm all for it .
anyway !
is there any disadvantage to using the newest itunes 9 version ( as of nov 3rd ) ?
as a backgrounder , my iphone is on 2.2.1 right now , i reformatted my computer with my old itunes and backups on it , so i now want to " re-backup " again with the current firmware version just to be safe ... then i 'll try to go to 3.0 .
will itunes 9 ( or any version for that matter ) force me to upgrade to 3.1 or do anything to the baseband etc that will prevent unlocking in the future ?
thanks .
