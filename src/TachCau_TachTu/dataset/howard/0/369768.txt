samsung galaxy s vibrant - bluetooth connection issues .
i need some advice on how to connect my motorola s9 bluetooth headset to my galaxy s vibrant .
i come from the windows world where it was easy but i guess with android ... not so much .
i go to the top status section on the phone , pull it down , turn on bluetooth , then i turn the bluetooth on on the s9 headset and it remains a nice blue ... meaning ... there 's no connection .
it turns green when it 's connected properly .
the s9 manual says to hold the power button on until the blue light flashes three times , then it goes into discover mode and from there , the phone should pick it up .
but alas , no go .
it just stays blue ( not seeing the phone or visa versa ) can anyone help me here ?
am i doing something wrong ??
thanks in advance !!
