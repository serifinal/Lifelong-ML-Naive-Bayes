iphone4 battery ... any real - world improvement ? .
i did n't get to see the jobster announce the new iphone yesterday .
i keep hearing snippets about a larger battery with added talk time .
how much more capacity is the " new " battery really adding , and how much more real life will it give those who surf the web , play games and do a lot of messaging ... as opposed to " talk time " which is really a moot point that sounds good from a marketing perspective ?
