issues with long text messages .
just asking a question for a friend , who 's on virgin but does n't use the forum here .
whenever he gets longer text messages ( the ones that get split into two parts , for instance , because the max .
characters have been exceeded ) from me , or from whoever else , he only gets part 2/2 and does n't get part 1/2 .
another person i know on virgin has the exact same problem .
is this a common issue with all virgin mobile customers ?
