bell turbo stick - poor download speeds .
i have been using the bell turbo stick around toronto in the last month .
download speeds from speedtest.net show i am getting less than 2mbps quite often and around 200kbps on uploads .
kind of dissapointing considering they advertise they have the biggest 3g network .
my colleague has a rogers stick and see 's speeds around 4 - 5mbps .
anybody else getting crappy speeds ?
