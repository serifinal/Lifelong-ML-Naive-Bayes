5310 camera ca n't save photos to memory card ? .
my nokia 5310 phone wo n't save photos to my memory card .
is this a feature ?
when the camera is active i am able to change the settings to save photos to my memory card .
as soon as i leave the settings and return to the camera the phone resets the photo storage location to phone memory .
wtf ?
and there 's no way to transfer photos from phone memory to my memory card .
what a pain .
i 'm running firmware v03 .63 dated 24-10-07 rm - 304 .
this is a rogers branded phone unlocked that i am using on at&t wireless .
