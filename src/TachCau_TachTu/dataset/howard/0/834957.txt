using cradlepoint with samsung vibrant .
not exactly sure where to post this , so mods feel free to move .
anyway , does anyone know of there is a way to use a cradlepoint router with an android phone ?
specifically , i 'm using a samsung vibrant .
i know that with the htc incredible , it asks what type of connection you want when you plug it into the router 's usb .
one of the options is " mobile broadband " which allows the router to dial a connection and connect .
but , on the vibrant that option is not available .
only " mass storage " , " music player " , and " samsung kies " show up as options .
none of these connect obviously .
any help would be appreciated .
thanks .
