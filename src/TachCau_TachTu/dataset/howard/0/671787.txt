got nokia 5800 and have a few questions .
hi , i just renewed a 3 yr plan and got a nokia 5800 .
it 's a very nice phone , but have a few questions .
1 .
i do n't have a data plan , and i want to be careful not to accidentally use it .
i connected to wifi and did some updates .
logs show that it did indeed use wifi and not 3g .
is there a way to completely block off 3g and only allow wifi ?
2 .
how do i know whether the connection is using wifi or " rogers internet " ?
3 .
can i browse via wifi ?
it seems when i try to browse using wifi , i 'm directed to a rogers page saying i do n't have browsing option on my plan and does n't let me use wifi to browse .
4 .
can i flash the phone with a korean language firmware ?
i took a look at navifirm , but i do n't know if there 's any appropriate korean firmware available .
is it reasonably safe to do if possible ?
thanks .
