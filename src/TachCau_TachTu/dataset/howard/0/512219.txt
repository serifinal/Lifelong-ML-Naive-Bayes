the official new sprint 3g sitings thread .
it was mentioned in another thread that there should be a louisiana 3g thread .
i would n't want a thread just for one state .
you ca n't leave out several other states that have huge 3g holes where the other carriers have 3g .
i do n't want to turn this into a sprint bashing thread have it closed .
everyone in 1x areas is upset that carrier xyz has 3g ... and everyone knows that .
so let 's not turn this into , well just switch carriers , sprint sucks , etc type thread .
i know there have been a couple of new 3g sitings in alabama somewhere , just do n't remember .
so if you are one of the lucky ones to be stuck in a 1x area or one of the few areas where alltel provides the 3g when on native sprint service ( like my area ) feel free to chime in .
so i 'll chime in ... nothing new to report on filing the gaps on the i - 10 corridor .
lake charles , la , lafayette , la , and hammond , la are still 1x .
baton rouge has alltel providing 3g , no native sprint 1x yet .
