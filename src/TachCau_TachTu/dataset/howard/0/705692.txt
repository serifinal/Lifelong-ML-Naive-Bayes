outlook business contact manager - best device ? .
i use outlook 2007 business contact manager -lrb- bcm -rrb- to track contacts , vendors and related e-mails .
i must be able to link e-mails to a specific client/contact .
which brand of smartphone offers the easiest syncing between bcm on my computer and the smartphone .
so far i 'm finding `` ca n't do that but here 's a workaround '' .
does anyone use bcm and have a smartphone they 're happy with with reasonable sync ?
thanks
