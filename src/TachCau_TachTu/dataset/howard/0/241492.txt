adding data to one line of a family plan for droid .
now , i am sure someone can point me to an answer for this , but i tried searching and had no luck .
my family has a nationwide select family shareplan with 4 lines .
i am not on the plan ; i have sprint sero .
what 's the cost / possibility of adding me to the family plan , with data for the droid ?
i 'm the only one on the family plan who needs data .
will it just be the cost of one more line ( $ 10 ) plus the $ 30 for the data ?
