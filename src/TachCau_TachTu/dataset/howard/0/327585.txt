the official " sasktel network upgrade & when can i get an iphone thread " .
i am like a lot of you out there .
i have been a long time sasktel supporter ( b / c of the coverage ) , and for a long time have seen my rogers subscribing friends sporting the latest and greatest phones while i am stuck with whatever phones get converted to cdma .
well , i am told this is all going to change .
when ?
not sure .
please post to this thread any info you may have regarding the sasktel network upgrade .
i am also interested in getting an iphone when it is available on the new network ( hey sasktel , keep in mind there is supposed to be a new iphone released this summer - please do n't shoot yourselves in the foot and only offer the 3gs ) .
