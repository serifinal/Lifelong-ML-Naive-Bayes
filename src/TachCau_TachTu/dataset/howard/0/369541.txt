not receiving text messages on ios 4.0 for 3g iphone ? .
has anybody gotten a weird bug where you 're in an app or something in ios 4.0 and you hear the sound that plays for a text message , but you do n't get any indication at all about the text ?
no little pop - up or new text in the messages app ?
i just got this error this morning while i was playing tetris and still after a few hours have n't received this phantom text on my iphone 3g .
