remove locked apps from at & t e71x -lrb- not demos but main menu icons -rrb- .
i just got the e71x the other day and so far i 'm really happy with it .
i got a developer 's certificate so i can sign apps , i installed x-plore and removed all the demo apps just fine .
there are a few at & t icons in the main menu that seem to be stuck with no option to move them or delete them .
i would like to know if there 's a back way into this so i can just delete them .
- shop games - shop apps - shop music - music apps i also kept wikimobile on there and ca n't seem to be able to move it either .
