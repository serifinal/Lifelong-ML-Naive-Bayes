nokia 6263 prepaid as usb wireless modem .
t - mobile prepaid nokia 6263 phone net - zero free dial - up nokia pc suite v. 7.1.40.1 ( latest ) nokia data cable ( dke - 2 ) i am trying to use my phone as a usb connected wireless dial - up modem for a computer .
i always get the same error , 678 , the remote computer did not respond .
is there a way that this will work ?
is it because i am a prepaid customer ?
t - mobile says the phone is not even able to be tethered as a modem , he even checked with nokia .
why is there so much write - up about this ability without support from either t - mobile or nokia ?
while i do not have much faith in the technical support department 's response , i have been unable to get it to work , either .
am i beating a dead horse ?
