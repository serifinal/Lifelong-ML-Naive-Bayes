samsung vibrant i9000m ( bell ) unlock bounty .
hi all , ok so it looks like the samsung galaxy s from bell has no unlock method in sight .
here is what i am suggesting .
people who wish to donate feel free to donate whatever amount , once i collect at least $ 60 to $ 100 i will go ahead and express order a bunch of turbo sims and others with express shipping and test them out .
once i get them and try all out i will post which ones work with what limitations / functionality .
if i find one that works and there is extra cash left , i will use it to order more of the ones that work and send them to the highest donators and continue to ship / allow pickup for all the others unlock cards that did not work to well .
$ 2 donations from everyone might make this a success allowing us all an unlock solution till bell / samsung allow us one .
if i don?t get enough cash i will refund everyone?s donations .
this is just a suggestion so please don?t start a war on this site .
i am trying to do myself and the community a favor .
pickup will be at downtown toronto / fairview mall donate here
