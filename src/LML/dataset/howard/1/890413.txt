google nexus one or htc desire coming to telus ? .
i 've been interested in the droid/milestone for a while , however , i 'm more interested in the htc desire .
i wish it had a physical keyboard though , but given the faster processor than in the milestone -lrb- 1ghz versus 550mhz -rrb- , i think i 'd rather have a desire .
has anyone heard anything about either the nexus one or the desire coming to telus or another canadian carrier ?
