micro usb female to mini usb male adapter .
does anyone know where i can find a micro usb female to mini usb male adapter ?
newegg has one but its 17 bux after shipping which is waaay overpriced for a piece of plastic and some metal .
i tried ebay with no luck as well .
anywhere in canada would be great .
thanks !
