htc desire/google nexus one and the even more plus 500 talk + text + web plan .
hi howardforums .
i 've been looking for a good phone to upgrade to for awhile now , with a cheap voice + text + data plan .

1 -rrb- can i simply buy the unlocked phone and get this plan from the website or store ?
or is it more complicated ?
-lrb- more fees and such -rrb- 2 -rrb- can i get this plan for cheaper ?
-lrb- with discounts , etc -rrb- 3 -rrb- htc desire or google nexus one ?
