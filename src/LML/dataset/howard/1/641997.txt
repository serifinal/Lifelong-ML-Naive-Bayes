swap to iphone questions ... .
hello all , i have a couple of questions which i am sure are pretty easy to answer but to be honest i am pretty green on the iphone .
i am considering swapping from my blackberry to a iphone not wanting to change my plan at all in case i do n't like it and want to go back to my blackberry and have a couple of questions ... 1 -rrb- currently i do not use blackberry?s push email service as i get hammered with spam !
i have the bis set up but to not forward emails -lrb- this is so the service books were still sent to device and i can email out -rrb- what i have done is forwarded my emails to gmail so i can take advantage of their spam filters , then have gmail set to forward to my xxxx@rogers.blackberry.net email .
that being said since it is set up this way after i insert sim card in would the iphone receive the emails the same way ?
or would it require some setting changes ?
2 -rrb- on sms and mms are there any other settings that need to be adjusted to send receive them once going to the iphone and sim is inserted ?
i don?t really care if i have an unlocked phone or one still branded to rogers , would the one branded to rogers make it easier so i wouldn?t have to adjust any further settings ?
or would both be the same and good to go right out of the box ??
thanks , tony2
