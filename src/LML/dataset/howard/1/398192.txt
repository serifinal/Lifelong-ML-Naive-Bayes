minutes purchase question .
can i purchase minutes online and have them automatically credited to my mom 's tracfone ?
my dad is in icu and she 's running low on minutes with updating everyone with his progress .
i figure if i can do this for her , it would be one less thing to worry about .
if i can , where is the best place to purchase from ?
i 'm pretty sure she has dmfl .
thanks .
