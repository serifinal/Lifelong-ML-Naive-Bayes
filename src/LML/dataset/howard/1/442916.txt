tethering on the samsung a707 ? .
i 'm thinking of getting this phone and i was wondering if someone has tried to tether with it and what speeds are you getting .
given that its an hsdpa phone it should be much better than tethering with any phone that has edge .
i have the a grandfathered mediaworks plan .
