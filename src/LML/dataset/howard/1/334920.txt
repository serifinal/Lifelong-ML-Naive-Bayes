ctr-500 -lrb- cradlepoint router -rrb- and uma ? .
i need to know for a international trip i 'll be taking .
i plan to get a usb modem with unlimited data in the country i 'm going to -lrb- uk -rrb- so i can plug it into my ctr-500 and then use that wi-fi signal to get uma on my t-mo bb to call back home -lrb- us -rrb- for free .
does anyone know if it 's possible to use uma off of a ctr-500 router ?
i would try it myself but i do not have a usb modem of my own , nor any other phone to try .
