where to buy sealed , factory unlocked phones with warranty ? .
i 'm in need of a new unlocked phone , but i 'm not having much luck finding `` just a phone '' .
i want an unlocked phone in the sealed , original factory packing , that has never had anything whatsoever to do with any carrier , and has a full manufacturer warranty .
in other words , i want to buy a phone like i buy anything else .
is this even possible ?
i see i can buy that way directly from nokia on their website -lrb- and one aging motorola on theirs -rrb- , but i was hoping to find a retailer with a variety to choose from -lrb- and hopefully some competitive pricing -rrb- .
does anyone know if such a retailer exists ?
or am i stuck with nokia -lrb- which i 'm not too fond of -rrb- ?
thanks !
