policy for adding a line to my family plan .
hello all , i currently have a jailbroken iphone 3g .
i am planning on upgrading to the next gen iphone when it 's released in a couple of months .
i am thinking that i want to keep my 3g since it 's jailbroken and i can use mywi to tether my ipad .
the way i understand it is , the extra line is $ 10.00 plus the $ 30.00 for the data plan .
my question is , by adding an extra line to my family plan using a device i already have , will i be required to sign a contract for that extra line or will i be able to have it on a month to month basis ?
thanks david
