any non-smartphones able to sync microsoft outlook -lrb- calendar and contacts -rrb- ? .
cheers everyone .
i 'm switching to at&t -lrb- from verizon -rrb- .
initially , i wanted a wifi capable smartphone that could sync to microsoft outlook , but it appears that you must have a data plan if you get a subsidized smartphone .
i do not need or want the data plan , but i do want my phone to be able to provide calendar reminders and have the calendar sync to my microsoft outlook calendar at work -lrb- manually syncing via usb cable or bluetooth is perfectly fine by me -rrb- .
do you know of any non-smartphones that can do this well ?
i 've done a little research and it appears lg phones ca n't for the most part -lrb- just a couple of verizon lg hones can - env 3 -lrb- vx9200 -rrb- , env touch -lrb- vx11000 -rrb- and chocolate touch -lrb- vx8575 -rrb- -rrb- .
i 've read that nokia has a software application called nokia pc suite that can do this .
has anyone ever used this software and done this ?
if so , what was your experience like ?
was the calendar or contacts limited in info ?
what phone do you have ?
how much memory on the phone ?
i was think of trying the nokia 6350 or mural -lrb- 6750 -rrb- .
thanks in advance !
regards , mark
