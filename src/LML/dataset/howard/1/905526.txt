at & t refusing to sell micro sims .
i called at & t and i called my local corporate at & t store .
they informed me that if i wanted , i could purchase one of the sim cards that can be cut into a micro sim card .
i visited my local at & t store and they refused to sell me a sim/micro sim outright or to replace my current sim in a blackberry .
is this normal policy , or just another case of mis-informed sales people ?
thank you
