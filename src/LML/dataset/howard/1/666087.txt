bold 9700 - syncing with microsoft office outlook 2007 business contact manager ? .
i am considering a bold 9700 purchase .
is it possible to sync with microsoft office 2007 business contact manager * without * first copying all the contacts to outlook ?
the reason that i am asking is that i currently own a palm treo 750 and i need to first copy my contacts from business contact manager into the contacts in outlook before i can sync with microsoft activesync .
thank you in advance .
