samsung sgh i-607 blackjack check local bands .
looking to upgrade soon and might have the option of getting a phone with just 850 3g band and wanted to see if there was a way to test coverage locally .
my blackjack does both so that does n't help alone , and if i set it to 850 gsm it loses all signal .
that might mean no 850 3g , but wanted to be sure that was the case and if not conclusive what i can do to see signals in the area .
