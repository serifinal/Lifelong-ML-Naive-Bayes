google nexus one on wind .
hey , i 'm considering getting the nexus one for wind , seeing as how i work here and want a phone for our network .
however , i do n't want just any old phone , and i have talked to a few customers about their experience with the nexus one in edmonton , and the response has been fairly positive .
however , most customers were new , so they have n't faced the network as long as some others , and i hope hoping i could get some opinions from some people .
any comments about the nexus one as a phone and on the wind network ?
