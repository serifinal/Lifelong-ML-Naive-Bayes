iphone4 vs n95 .
hello .
thinking to make a trial for the iphone4 .
however 1 big question : one of the feature i like the more with my n95 is '' sending files and pics '' to my main computer with bluethooth -lrb- no wires to connect -rrb- .
can we make it with the iphone ?
can i configure my phone to be part of my network ?
tks to let me know
