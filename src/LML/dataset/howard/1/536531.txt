bell share vs telus share v.iphone .
hey currently out of contract with bell right now .
looking at 2 16g iphones .
looking at both of the 60 $ per line options with both companies .
which has more to offer in your guys opinion ?
should i take this opportunity to bounce from bell , or could i get the better offer from them ?
