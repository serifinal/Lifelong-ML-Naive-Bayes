env 3 outlook sync questions .
i need a phone which can sync calendars and contacts with outlook .
i do n't need email on my phone .
i have an xv 6800 now , and despise the thing .
i 'm due for a new contract , so i was looking at the env 3 .
-lrb- i realize i 'm a rare bread that wants to sync cal/contacts but no data/email -rrb- according to lg 's site , lgs sync program , they have a program that can sync with outlook .
has anyone had any experience with this ?
