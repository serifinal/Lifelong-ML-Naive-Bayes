a couple of questions about upgrading .
me and my wife are both currently secondary lines on a 4 line family share -lrb- connect -rrb- plan with her parents .
me and the wife are due for an upgrade in just over two week , the in-laws are not due till august .
i am looking to get a droid , and the wife is wanting either a env touch or a rouge .
i know that i will have to drop down from the connect plan and add the smart phone data plan .
i also know that either of the phones that she wants -lrb- or any phone that she would want -rrb- also require data .
1 .
what would i drop down to ?
would i be able to go down to the now defunct select plan or would i have to go to one of the new `` talk and text '' plans ?
-lrb- i know the price for a secondary line would end up being the same either way , but i am just wondering . -rrb-
2 .
would she have to get the new `` talk and text '' plan and the new add on data , or would we be able to keep her on the connect plan to cover the data ?
3 .
would we be able to upgrade these line without the account holder -lrb- father in-law -rrb- or would he have to be there ?
4 .
if both me and her do have to go to the `` talk and text '' plan how will that effect the family share account ?
would the in-laws have to change to the new plan or could they stay on connect until they upgrade ?
