new iphone with data unlimited on account .
hi all , i have a n82 with data unlimited for $ 15 a month , which allows for all data usage .
will i be able to get the new iphone whenever it comes out and grandfather my current data plan ?
things seem pretty vague now , and att customer support is just as confused .
thanks , rex
