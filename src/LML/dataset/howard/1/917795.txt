vivaz vs. x10 vs. wave vs. beam vs. galaxy s vs. nokia symbian ^ 3 .
so here it is ... the comparison between the top dogs , most which have n't released or will take some time to release .
i 'm looking for my next phone and those are my top considerations .
i recently just bought a used nam n97 but it just does n't really cut it for me .
seems kind of slow to me .
keyboard is nice but i think i can live with a virtual one .
i 've had eyes on the xperia x10 for a long long time already but because it took so long to release , i 've put all those other considerations in the thread title .
as gsm arena just release the x10 review , it does not sound very promising for such an expensive device to perform below expectations and i 'm quite disappointed .
looking at all other phones , they seem to pack a lot of features like super amoled , hd recording , mini-projector from the beam -lrb- but i do wonder how useful it is -rrb- , capacitative touch screen , keyboard , etc. ... i guess customer service and product support is equally as important as the device itself so i 'm wondering if any of you have had good/bad experiences from companies to share and what handset should i go with ?
i 'm not in a hurry at all to change phones as i need to wait for the price to drop -lrb- $ 770usd -rrb- for x10 is just way too expensive .
thanks
