exchanging internet order in store .
so i got a chocolate touch with my new every 2 , but i am not liking the phone .
i have played with my wifes env touch and have fell in love with it .
the question i have is - can i take my chocolate that i ordered online and exchange it for an env touch in a corporate store ?
or will i have to reactivate my dare , send the choc touch in , wait until they receive it , then pick my new phone ?
if i do have to send it in , does anyone know how long the process takes ?
when i selected the phone , i could have gotten either the choco or the env for free , but i 'm afraid that if i have to wait to send it in that i will lose the free pricing and get stuck paying for a phone .
i have this feeling that it may be a hassle in the making , but i hope i am wrong .
thanks !
