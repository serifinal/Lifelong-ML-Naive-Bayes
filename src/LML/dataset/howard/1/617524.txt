does the samsung behold support tethering via bt .
anyone know if the new samsung behold will support bluetooth tethering ??? still trying to find a phone that i like that i can actually use my n810 tablet with ... only have a week or so left to return the g1 .
seems like none of the phones i 'd like to have support tethering via bt ... whats the use of all these gadgets that should work together if all the providers keep them from serving their purpose ... ?
