pre-order and in-store purchase on launch day ? .
what if i pre-order to avoid the lines and on my way to work i see no line at best buy -lrb- insert any retailer here -rrb- .
can i buy it and when mine arrives just return it to the apple store ?
or once i pre-order , is my upgrade eligibility gone ?
