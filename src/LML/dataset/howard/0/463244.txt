motorola droid handscent sms issue .
i 'm using motorola droid on cricket and everything works ; talk , text , mms , and web over 3g .
however i just started using handscent sms in place of the default android message app and i can send / receive sms and i can receive mms through handscent but i can not send mms via handscent .
what 's weird is that mms works fine via the default android message app .
i contacted the developer of handscent but so far none of the updates to the app have fixed it .
i do n't know if the issue is the handscent app or the fact that my phone has to go through iptables to get data .
any ideas on what could be causing this ?
i 've looked through all of handscent settings but have n't seen anything that stands out as a potential cause .
for now i just have to use the default android message app for sending mms .
