how many minutes on an `` unlimited '' plan is considered `` unlimited '' .
page plus has some issues with kicking off `` high usage '' subscribers .
apparently , users with 100 minutes a day or more are considered `` abusers '' with `` unreasonable usage '' on their unlimited plan .
i 've seen reports that 5000 minutes was the cap for old sprint mvno -lrb- and one of the first unlimited prepaid plan carriers -rrb- airlink/power link .
i also saw one post stating that straight talk allowed over 40,000 minutes a month before it is considered abuse .
so what should be a standard of what is considered a reasonable `` unlimited '' cap for talk .
data is pretty much 5 gigs universally for `` unlimited '' but for talk , it seems harder to define .
views please .
