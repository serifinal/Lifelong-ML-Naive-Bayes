motorola droid slider issue - gap between screen and keyboard .
my droid definitely had an issue with the slider mechanism .
it became extremely loose and would open up in my pocket all the time .
also , there was a huge gap between the slider and the keyboard .
i was wondering if anyone else has had this issue ?
