recording video with good audio .
does anyone have any good tips on how to hold the env touch to record video without messing up the audio ?
i recorded a couple videos yesterday and some where with shell open and closed .
i noticed all the videos sounded different and the audio would go from good to bad every couple every so often .
i do n't know if i was covering the speaker but that might have been it .
