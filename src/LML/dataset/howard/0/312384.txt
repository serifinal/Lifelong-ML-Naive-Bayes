samsung wave vs samsung galaxy s / vibrant .
anyone who has a samsung wave and a galaxy s / vibrant can compare the two ?
i 'm not too concerned about android vs bada as i 'm not a heavy user .
i 'm more concerned about other things like the feel and look , camera , battery life , call quality and reception , etc. .
