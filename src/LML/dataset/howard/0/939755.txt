samsung galaxy spica -lrb- rogers -rrb- -- unlock to work with fido ? .
all , i have a -lrb- supposedly -rrb- rogers-locked samsung galaxy spica .
when i put my fido sim card in it for the first time , it did not `` ask '' for an unlock code , and the phone indicated that it was roaming and connected to the rogers network .
attempts to actually unlock the phone -lrb- i bought an unlock code -rrb- just give error messages .
is this `` one of those phones '' that can be used on fido without unlocking ?
am i really `` roaming '' ?
or should i just find someone with a bell or telus sim and really unlock the phone ?
thanks .
