sim cards - $ 10 at walmart - no in-store activation .
this is for some of you that have been complaining about not being able to get the sim cards for $ 5 in bell stores without being forced to activate in-store for $ 35 - $ 50 .
check your local walmart `` in-store flyer '' on the website .
on the left side , click on `` connection centre '' .
first page , bottom left .

enjoy !
