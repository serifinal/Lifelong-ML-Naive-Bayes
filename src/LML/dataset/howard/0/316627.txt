video calling .
i have a tytn ii .
fido have a video calling feature but you have to pay by minute .
as i know , the video data transfer is using 3g data and audio transfer is using regular gsm .
i just want to know how fido monitor the video calling if video data transfer is using 3g .
did they custom programmed on fido-branded phone if people using video calling on fido branded phone .
the system will know how to bill .
if so , if i using non-fido branded phone , video data transfer is on my 6gb data package .
as long as not over the 6gb limit , can i bypress the video calling pay by minute ?
