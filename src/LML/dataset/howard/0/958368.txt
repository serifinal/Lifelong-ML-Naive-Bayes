transfer old version of app from one iphone to another . .
so on my first gen iphone , i have an old version of an app that i like .
i have n't synced it with itunes in a while .
i have the new version of the app on my 3gs , and i hate the new version .
so i 'm wondering if there is any way to get the old version from one iphone to the other .
i was thinking if i deleted the new version from my 3gs and deleted it out of itunes , then synced my old iphone , that would get the old version into itunes , then i could just sync my 3gs and it would get the old version of the app on it .
any idea if this would work , or would there be another way to do it ?
