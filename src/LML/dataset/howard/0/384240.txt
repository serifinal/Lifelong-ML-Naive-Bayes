help with iphone 2g - what do i do with it to unlock/jailbreak ? .
i just got a 2g iphone off ebay ... i have no clue what to do with it but essentially i want to unlock it for use when i go on vacation in europe with a prepaid sim ... the problems im encountering is that i dont know which os version it has installed ... when i put in an old att prepaid sim it prompts me to activate it , when i put in a vodaphone/verizon sim nothing happens .
please point me in the right direction ... thanks so much , sorry for the noob question
