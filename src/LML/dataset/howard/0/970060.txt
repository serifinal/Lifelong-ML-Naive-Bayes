if you swap your iphone , make sure it 's new ! .
when i got my iphone back in november , the battery life was average - however lately i noticed i was not getting the standby time i should be getting so i booked an appointment at the apple store -lrb- square one -rrb- to have a battery test performed .
turns out my iphone battery was not up-to-par and the tech swapped it for -lrb- what i thought -rrb- was a new device .
i slipped the new iphone in my roots tuff case and went home .
when i got there , i was about to place a screen protector on it and noticed the is a chip in the top-left corner of the replacement unit -lrb- screen -rrb- .
i called the apple store back and they booked another appointment for me to come in and swap it again .
keep in mind i have the extended apple care coverage .
so my question is , when replacing a unit that is still under manufacturers warranty along with having the extended warranty - should i not get a brand new unit instead of what is obviously a refurbished one ?
i have an appointment tomorrow to sway again - i wont settle for a refurbished unit this time .
am i wrong for wanting a new replacement ?
i mean i bought the device last month .
