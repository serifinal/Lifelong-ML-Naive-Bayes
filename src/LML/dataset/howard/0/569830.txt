possible to keep my plan with fewer minutes + $ 30 data with the new vibrant ? .
i 'm interested in an upgrade to the vibrant -lrb- currently out of current and long time t-mobile customer -rrb- .
just wondering if i could keep my current voice plan -lrb- $ 30 -rrb- and add the requisite $ 30 data plan to it rather than being forced into a plan with the unneeded minutes .
thanks ...
