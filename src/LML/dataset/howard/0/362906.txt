is samsung ever going to release android 2.x for samsung galaxy i7500 ? .
hi guys , so , i recently acquired a samsung galaxy .
fell in love with it , until i found out it was running android 1.5 .
i 'm stuck with android 1.5 on my phone , and i 'm wondering if samsung is going to release android 2.x to samsung galaxy users ?
i 've been hearing they 're going to leave those people with 1.5 behind to fend for themselves and move on to other things .
i think if this is the case , this phone will be my last product i buy from them .
they 've already released 2.x for samsung galaxy spica , so why have n't samsung done anything for the i7500 ?
oh , and if it 's going to be released , does anybody know a date ?
i know lots of others with the galaxy i7500 that are pissed about this also , so any info would be appreciated
