n82 firmwares .
are there still product codes for the n82 stuck on v20 firmware ?
i recently found my usb cable but have n't used it .
however about 3 - 4 months ago i tried and my product code -lrb- taiwan -rrb- is still stuck on v20 .
booo .
so i can hope that maybe v31 is finally out for me , but if that fails , what 's the best way to deal with this .
change to another product code ?
if so , what software do i use ?
nss ?
where to get that ?
ok , now next step assuming i change my product code , will a firmware update now wipe everything out -lrb- my apps -rrb- ?
why is n't there like a definitive firmware upgrade guide on this forum ... sigh .
