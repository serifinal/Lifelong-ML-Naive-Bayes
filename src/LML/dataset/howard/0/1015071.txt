new hspa rocket stick & $ 30 6gb data plan .
i just got this new rocket stick .
1 have 6gb data plan with blackberry apn 3 .
i confirm it is working fine in gta area i am getting 21mbs .
very impressive !
i can also confirm that it uses bucket of data from 6gb .
i was speaking with technical support they added apn6 to acess internet .
technical support confirms that rocket stick recognizes as a data device any data used not considered as teathering and uses actual data .
i just want to reconfirm this with anyone using rocket stick with the promotional data plan prior to june 8 2009 and if anyone had issues or being charged pay per use . .
