samsung rogue spotted in dallas .
i was waiting for a flight out of dallas yesterday and stopped by the samsung kiosk they had in the termnial and they had a verizon branded samsung rogue in the front case .
it was n't turned on , but if they are displaying it at the airport , hopefully they will be releasing it soon .
i have the omnia right now and i ca n't type well at all with the virtual keyboard .
i 'm hoping the rogue is released before my 30 day window is up .
