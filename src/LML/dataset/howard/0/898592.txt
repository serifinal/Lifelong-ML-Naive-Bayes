bell ipad plan on usb stick .
i see that bell is offering a very good data plan for the ipad - up to 5 gb every 30 days for $ 35 .
however , i do n't see anything similar for anyone using a mobile wireless e.g. the novatel u998 .
i have a netbook , and i would like to use it rather than spending the money on a new ipad .
the netbook came preloaded with skype .
so here 's my question .
why ca n't a person pick up a ipad microsim , and use it in the novatel stick ?
with adapter of course .
then i can browse and make calls from the netbook with skype .
right ?
any reason why it would n't work ?
