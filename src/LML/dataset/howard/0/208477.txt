cricket passed up sprint ? .
during my holiday travels i noticed a cricket billboard in lake charles , la. `` cricket !?
there 's no cricket here . ''
i later checked online and found they indeed had coverage in lake charles .
they even had 3g coverage to boot !
i found the press release from around nov 17,2009 .
i was shocked .
so now we have this little carrier building out 3g in a town that people on this forum say there is no return of investment .
i never thought i would see tmobile build 3g in that area before sprint , but they did , and now cricket built out voice and 3g before sprint could even get 3g off the ground .
i 'm impressed .
sprint is truly dropping the ball ... .
in that area they now have at&t , verizon , tmobile and cricket providing 3g while sprint is dead last sitting on 1x .
build it and they will come , do n't build it and they will leave .
