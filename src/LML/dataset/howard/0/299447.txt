connecting a router to the bell turbo hub .
does anyone know the proper way to do this ?
i connected a cable from one of the four ports on the w35 hub to the wan port of my router .
then i connected that router to a computer .
the routers setup page shows the turbo hub is connected but i ca n't get internet access ?
any help would be great .
