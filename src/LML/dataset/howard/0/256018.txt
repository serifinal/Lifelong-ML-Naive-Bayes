real world coverage maps ? .
edit : http://www.coveragemapper.com for the maps and application i 've been think about this for a while , and i 'd like some input .
would anyone here , who 's using an android 2.1 + device , be willing to install an application that stores signal strengths and locations , and uploads it to a server ?
we could use the data to generate a real coverage map .
i see two issues right away : 1 .
battery by default , i 'd set the application to only run when the device is plugged in , so you 'd either risk killing your battery , or you 'd need to invest in a car charger .
it should n't be too power hungry , as it does n't need the screen , but the gps and cellular radios would have to be on .
2 .
privacy the data i 'd collect would be : signal strength : a value from 0-31 , or 99 operator : 302490 -lrb- or whatever network you 're on -rrb- latitude : 123.456 -lrb- precise to about 100m -rrb- longitude : 123.456 -lrb- precise to about 100m -rrb- time : 2010-06-07 23:06 nothing would be tied back to any individual user .
unfortunately , there 's no way for an android application to do a network scan , which was my original idea , so this will only work for the network your phone is currently registered on .
anyway , with enough people running the application , i should be able to overlay a 0.001 degree x 0.001 degree grid on a map , and colour code each square relative the signal strength .
i 've got a proof of concept application running on my phone , but it would need a few weeks of work to get it into a usable state .
so what are your thoughts ?
would you be willing to install and run the application ?
