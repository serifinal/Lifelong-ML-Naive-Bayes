triangular swap or premium swap .
is it possible to do a number swap with fido from line a to a prepaid and get a new number on the line a ?
or do i have to wait 90 days to for the number to be released back into the pool ?
i called them and they said that this is not possible .
i do it everyday for customers at telus , it 's called triangular swap or premium swap .
fido says this does n't exist !
