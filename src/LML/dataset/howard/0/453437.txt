group connect feature on boost mobile .
i know in the past that group connect was not offered on boost mobile phones .
however , i was told recently that if you switch from a sprint/nextel post paid account to a boost account you can now bring your existing dc number over as well .
if so , would that enable me to use group connect as a boost customer ?
any help is greatly appreciated .
