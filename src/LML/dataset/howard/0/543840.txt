adding a line onto an existing t-mobile individual plan ? .
is that even possible ?
i have one year left on my contract on my plan .
currently i have : 1000 anytime minutes with free nights and weekends for 39.99 t-mobile to t-mobile minutes for 5.99 unlimited texts for 15 -lrb- had to get this one not to get a etf when i got rid of the bb -rrb- t-zones for 5.99 my gf was asking about going on a plan with me but not really sure what the best deal is , i think i have a pretty solid plan and dont really want to lose it .
can i just somehow add her onto my line ?
if not , since i am still under contract it looks like the best alternative would be the even more plan for 160 that includes unlimited text , internet , and 1500 minutes , which im not too sure how much she talks to on the phone to people outside of t-mobile
