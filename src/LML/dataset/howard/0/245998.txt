new micro card .
the micro card from my son 's phone lg vx6100 was stolen and i had to buy new one .
using adapter i transferred songs on the new card -lrb- 2g -rrb- .
i inserted the card in to the phone but i can not play music .
if i go to `` my music '' the old titles and albums are there but can not be played .
if i check the memory card the new card is recognized -lrb- it shows it is 2 g card with 1.3 g free pace , the old one was 1 g -rrb- .
what i am i doing wrong .
