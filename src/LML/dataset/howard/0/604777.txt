will my rogers iphone work on bell 's new system ? .
i own a iphone 3g with no contract , i bought it used , and purchased a prepaid plan for it along with a sim card .
any chance it will work on bells new network ?
would it be as easy buying a bell sim or would i have to get the phone unlocked first before putting in a bell sim ?
