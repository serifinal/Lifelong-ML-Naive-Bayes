telus iphone4 and jailbreakme.com .
... will that website work to jailbreak a telus iphone4 ?
what firmware version does the telus one have ?
okay , i have always been a blackberry user and winmo devices before that .
i know those devices inside and out -lrb- including hacking winmo devices to death -rrb- but i know nothing about iphones .
in fact , i have always stayed away from iphones because of no multitasking , no today screen , etc. -lrb- even though i am a macbook pro user - so nothing against apple per say -rrb- anyway , i was playing with someone 's new iphone4 and the screen looks sweet , as does the new form factor and liking the front facing camera too .
how easy is it to jailbreak this phone ?
because being able to install intelliscreen is pretty much the deal breaker for me .
can i use jailbreakme.com ?
i know nothing about how to jailbreak or even where to start ... .
or even how to install apps that are n't in the appstore for that matter and every tutorial i read involves about 300 steps .
