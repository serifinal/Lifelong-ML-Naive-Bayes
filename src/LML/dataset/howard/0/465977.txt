laurence kim peek aka the real rainman has passed away .
i had never known that the movie rainman was based on a real person when the movie first came out .
after i saw a documentary on him i was just amazed at his ability to recall the information that he was able to and his ability to function at the high level that he was able to being a savant .
i have a great memory and can recall a lot of information but nowhere near what he was able to do .
part of the documentary is on youtube for those hat have n't seen it .
