moto droid -lrb- 1 -rrb- update to froyo 2.2 .
for those of you that have received it , what do you think of it ?
i dont have it yet .
i was told by a verizon rep when i got my phone replaced that it is in circulation now being sent to 10,000 phones at a time .
and i should expect it sometime soon .
seems to be all good and information on their site sounds good , too bad it doesnt let u update manually .
just trying to find out the goods n bads of froyo , if there are any of course .
thanks !
