dropping 3g connection during calls ? .
since about a week or so , i have noticed that when i am in a call , i no longer am able to access the 3g or edge networks on rogers and fido .
i have read and searched but i have not found anything .
i have contacted rogers and they reset my phone thinking it was a software issue . .
it has also happening on fido network .
is this happening to anyone else ?
