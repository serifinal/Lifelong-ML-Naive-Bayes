3390 battery disadvantage .
it bothers me a lot that when you remove the battery from the 3390 phone , it resets the time , date and high scores .
most ppl out there probably do n't remove the battery that often but when you have a data cable , you really do n't have much of a choice !
do the 8290s and the 8890s have the same problem ?
do you know the reason why nokia decided to overlook this problem ?
i know that in the user manual it states that the time will reset if you remove the battery , so obviously they were aware of it !
