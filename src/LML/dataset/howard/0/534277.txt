text messages are n't working on iphone north of toronto ? .
hey everyone , i 'm from toronto and my iphone has worked fine .
i 'm at my parents for the holidays in midland about 1.5 hours north , just north of barrie .
for some reason my texts will not work .
i have 100 % hspa signal but every time i send a text it takes about 3 minutes then says failed .
if i restart my phone and hit send right away , it sends immediately , and also receives a few texts .
5 minutes later it does n't work anymore and i have to restart .
i called telus he updated my sim card and something else and had me reset the network settings on my phone .
this did n't do anything .
he said if it does n't work to not call back but to go to apple since there 's something wrong with my phone .
this does n't make sense though as it worked perfectly fine until i was just over an hour north of the city .
has anyone see or heard of this or have any suggestions ?
really frustrating !
calls and data work perfectly just no texting !
