berryannoying saves photos at jpeg.rem .
has anyone else had trouble with this ?
through the normal camera app the bold saves the photos at jpg 's . .
so i can just hook up my phone to the desktop in disk mode and grab the photos from it .
but ive been using berryannoying lately and it saves photos at jpeg.rem ... so when i copy them to the desktop and just change the file extension . .
they wont work .
but i converts them or something just fine when i email the jpeg.rem photos because they show up as jpg 's in email .
how do i fix this ?
ports
