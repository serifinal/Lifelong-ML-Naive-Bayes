samsung galaxy s vibrant accessories .
hello everyone , on monday i picked up a galaxy s phone and have been playing around with it for a few days .
one the things i was really excited about was the google maps gps navigation option .
once i figured out the ins & outs of using the app it worked wonderfully .
if i had to find a fault it would be that the gps signal works only well when i 'm outside or have the phone right under my wind shield in my car .
although that 's not different than my handheld garmin so ... my biggest problem is trying to figure out how to mount my phone so i can use it as a car gps ?
samsung does n't have anything listed on their website , nor does bell .
i found something from the us but its $ 50 before duty , etc. .
does anyone have any suggestions ?
