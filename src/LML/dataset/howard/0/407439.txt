fs : two motorola nextel i315s with sim card $ 35 shipped to us address .
as listed above , i have for sale two motorola nextel i315s each has a sim card .
these work great for boost mobile or under contract for nextel .
these do have direct talk and that is how i have been using these for the past couple of years for direct simplex .
i feel better giving one of these to my sons since it does n't get interference like frs/gmrs/murs and it will still work for wireless 911 in an emergency .
