not receiving text messages .
i 'm on t-mobile , with an unlocked samsung innov8 .
i have used this phone since may of this year sending and receiving over thousands and thousands of texts .
no issues there .
till 3 days ago .
now the phone does n't receive texts , unless i reboot the phone , then the texts come flooding in .
i went to the t-mobile store got a new sim card and put my new sim card into a t-mobile branded phone and it worked fine , no issues there .
i could send and receive texts like there was no issue .
put it back in my innov8 and there was an issue sending and receiving texts again .
it only received them when i rebooted the phone .
i also get delivery reports without any problem .
what confuses me is that mms comes through fine .
any idea what the issue could be ?
i talked to customer care , without anything going on , so i 'm kinda lost .
