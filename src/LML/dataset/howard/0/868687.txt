.
i have a perfect condition black at&t 32gb iphone 4 .
i very recently went to the apple store and had it swapped out with a refurb so that i could sell it .
this unit is flawless .
it comes with original box -lrb- imei wo n't match because of refurb -rrb- as well as all original accessories .
i am an ios developer so this is a registered development device and is currently running ios 5 beta 6 .
as you can see from the pictures it is perfect and will give regular users a chance to play with ios 5 early .
it is very very stable and works like a champ .
i am accepting offers only for devices that are high end smartphones .
i would like $ 450 for this device shipped anywhere in the us .
this device is currently locked to at&t as there is no viable jailbreak or unlock for ios 5 .
