facetime .
interesting feature that might be actually useful .
someone steals your phone .
you can send a msg and when the person checks the msg the phone takes a picture of you and sends you an email back .
that could be one of the many things it could do , but not sure if apple will say it can do that or allow it to do that i just hope ipad 2 does get this feature and also apple allows facetime users and ichat av users communicate in the future .
thats pretty much the only way to get facetime to actually work in the long run and have millions of people actually use it .
