verizon wireless usb760 modem speed .
sorry if this is in the wrong place .
i could n't find a modem section .
when i go into the configuration of the modem it says the maximum speed is set to 230400 .
i am able to change that to a higher number of either 460800 or 921600 .
my question is : why is it set so much lower than it could go ?
and what happens if i set it higher ?
would the modem over-heat ?
