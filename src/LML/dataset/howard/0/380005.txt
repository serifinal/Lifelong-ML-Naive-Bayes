using vpn total internet on usb web connect .
hi all , i bought a used t-mobile usb web connect stick off of craigs list and would like to just take the sim out of my unlocked iphone and put into the usb data stick .
i am using the vpn total internet -lrb- generic smart phone package -rrb- on my iphone .
i tried to use the stick with my sim card and i get a message in my web browser that says `` to connect to the internet with the device you are using , you 'll need a webconnect data plan . ''
my question is there anyway to get around this ?
i really do not want to pay $ 60 a month for their internet plan .
please help me .
