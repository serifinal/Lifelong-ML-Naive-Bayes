freezing issue - bell galaxy s .
i picked up the galaxy s on friday afternoon from the bell store and have been having freezing issues ever since .
by my count it froze at least a couple dozen times in the first 48 hours .
i exchanged the phone on sunday afternoon and am having the same issue with the replacement phone .
i charged the new phone using the wall charger for 12 continuous hours and it 's still freezing at random times it seems .
right now it 's been freezing while laying on my desk with no input .
it took me a few tries simply to do a factory reset because it would freeze before i could finish entering the reset code .
there is n't much info out there on this particular model phone from bell but it did read elsewhere , a few mentions of freezing and the bell galaxy s. i really do n't have the patients to be try to figure this out .
does anyone have any advice ?
it seems to freeze more when i 'm in my home office which has always had bad reception .
is it possible that the freezing is related to that ?
one other thing i noticed is that the battery status is very inaccurate .
i charged the phone over night for 12 hours , turned the phone on for about 30 minutes and the battery status now reads 89 % , which does n't seem reasonable .
