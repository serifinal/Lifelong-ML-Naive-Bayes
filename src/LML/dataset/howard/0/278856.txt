why does apple.ca say iphone4 and ipad microsim cards are not interchangeable ? .
ok , it 's great news that unlocked iphone 4 will be available through apple canada .
both the iphone 4 and the ipad use the smaller form-factor microsim cards , but i notice on their website , in the faq section there is the following : `` are iphone 4 and ipad micro-sim cards interchangeable ?
no .
your ipad micro-sim card will not work with your iphone . ''
what 's the reason for this ?
