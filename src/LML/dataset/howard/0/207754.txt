outgoing mail server for wind ? .
anyone know how to setup the outgoing mail server for wind ?
i setup my shaw email on my google ion , and it did n't like any combination of shaw smtp server information .
so , i randomly put smtp.windmobile.ca and it seemed to work .
however , when i send an email it does n't .
anyone have any luck with this ?
