fs : lnib rogers mf668 rocket stick - hspa + 21mbps .
hey all , i have only used it for 5 minutes .
i am selling a brand new rogers mf668 rocket stick .
it works on the new hspa + network at speeds up to 21mbps .
it will work with both rogers or fido accounts .
only reason i am not returning it to rogers is because i need the money to pay the account immediately -lrb- i am on preauthorized credit card and do n't want the charge to hit my card -rrb- .
i only bought it to test it , no intention of keeping it !
the card sells for $ 200 + tax -lrb- $ 225 -rrb- + shipping .
i will sell it for $ 220 and do a local meetup in toronto .
save shipping , backorder delay , and a few bucks !
receipts for warranty are included !
