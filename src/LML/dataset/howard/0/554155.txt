hi i have an iphone 3gs , 16gb , black , and locked to bell .
it can be unlocked using free software online .
no major scratches , dents , etc. .
it looks brand new .
pictures posted below .
comes with everything in the box , including the box , and a switcheasy vulcan case -lrb- $ 20 value -rrb- .
firmware is 3.1.3 .
i 'm asking $ 600 o.b.o. pm if you have any questions .
only face to face deals in the gta , so that means i wo n't ship the phone .
thanks , phu .
