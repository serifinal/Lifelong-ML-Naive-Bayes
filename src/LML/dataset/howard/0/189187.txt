fs : google nexus one -lrb- at&t / rogers -rrb- - rooted w / desire rom .
i have a one week old nexus one for sale .
comes with all the packaging and everything that was in the original box .
phone is really awesome , but i miss my bb keyboard .
phone is in awesome shape .
i 've rooted it and installed the desire rom to get sense ui which i like way better .
i can leave it like that or put it back to stock nexus one android 2.1 .
the sense ui adds some very nice features -lrb- including tethering -rrb- .
as the phone is rooted it is easy too swap back and forth .
still under google warranty .
$ 600 .
west gta .
pm is best
