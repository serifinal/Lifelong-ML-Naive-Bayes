rural synergy sites still happening ? .
now that i do n't have roaming coverage anymore , i 've gotten a lot more interested in where sprint has on-network service .
here in the pacific northwest , it seems like there are a lot of areas where synergy sites have n't yet happened .
for example , the area around baker city , or is covered by iden , but cdma coverage on i-84 eastbound ends at la grande and does n't pick back up until you reach ontario .
i 'm curious how many areas there are like this - it 's been a long time since sprint acquired nextel , so i 'm surprised there is n't coverage synergy everywhere .
to folks `` in the know , '' are these projects still happening ?
if so , any idea when we might see more coverage here in the great northwest ?
