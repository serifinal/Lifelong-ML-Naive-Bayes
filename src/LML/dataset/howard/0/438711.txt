cellumap : coverage plots for blackberry .
i 'd like to announce that cellumap is now available for gps-enabled blackberrys os 4.5 and higher .
works for all carriers and all technologies -lrb- iden/cdma/gsm / umts -rrb- ... what is cellumap ?
it 's a real-time cellular mapping application , that has been available on symbian only for the past year , but is now available for blackberry .
the phone apps have different looks , but generally do the same thing -lrb- well , symbian ca n't show freq info , so bb has a leg up there -rrb- .
but both apps show signal strength and cell info .
how does it work ?
1 - download the app ota by pointing your blackberry browser to : cellumap.com/ota ... or go here to download alx and cod files for desktop install .
2 - run the app , and once you have a gps lock , press the `` send data '' button to plot your point on the cellumap main page -lrb- cellumap running on a bold2 9700 -rrb- 3 - to view your point -lrb- and everyone elses -rrb- go to cellumap cellular coverage maps and zoom in an area -lrb- type a city or zip code in the maps search box -rrb- , select the network/technology/time-frame , and then hit the `` signal strength '' button to see all points .
if no points are available in your area , that means nobody plotted any yet -lrb- . .
so get out there ! -rrb- .
-lrb- example of coverage point viewing -rrb- theres a small tutorial here to help you get started with the map-viewing if it 's a little complicated : cellumap map tutorial so have fun with the app !
get out and plot some points !
any questions can be posted here , or contact me via the cellumap website .
ps - right now it 's only 1 point per button press .
an `` auto-logging '' type feature that will automatically send points based on distance will come in a future release .
