not receiving text messages from a rogers client .
hey there , i activated an iphone 3gs today and tried out the text messaging .
i am able to send and receive texts from other telus clients , but i ca n't seem to receive texts from a friend who is with rogers .
she receives everything i send to her , though .
anyone else experience a similar problem ?
