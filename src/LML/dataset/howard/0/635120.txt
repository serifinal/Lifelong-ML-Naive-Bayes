switching between iphone and bb 9700 - sim swap only ? .
when i was on rogers , i had a code on my account that would allow me to switch between my iphone and a blackberry - just swap the sim .
can this be done with bell 's new network ?
can i swap the sim between devices and use the full fictionally of both devices ?
i.e. bis on the blackberry ?
cheers
