nexus one amoled too bright in low light .
i have very sensitive eyes and when i see bright light against a very dark background i get a `` halo effect '' that makes it hard for me to focus .
this was n't a problem so much on my ipod touch .
but i 'm finding that in a dark room -lrb- e.g. lights off at night or a dark nightclub -rrb- , even at the lowest brightness , it 's very tiring to look at this screen .
the dots around the edges of letters start to drift in and out of focus .
especially if i 'm in a site or app that uses white text on black .
any ideas on what i can do ?
one thing i know for sure , i will stay away from any of the new `` super amoled '' phones coming out ... i 'm only 27 and i want my eyes to survive well into old age
