telus theives : bell , telus lose rural overpayments appeal .
so telus tells customers that they need money for one thing and then they do n't do it then want to use it for something else - how scuzzy can a company get ?
is that not fraud ?
http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe...rticle1292670/ the phone companies themselves also asked for a reversal of the crtc ruling , because they had earmarked the funds for other purposes .
the surpluses , the accumulation of about four years of customer overpayments , followed a 2002 effort by the crtc to encourage competition in the local phone services market by making monthly rates high enough to attract new entrants .
in effect , a cushion was built into the rates , but in return , the country 's phone companies were told to park some of the extra money in deferral accounts .
