adding $ 25/500mb data to existing plan .
i 've been a fido customer for a while now under 3 yr contract with the following plan : $ 17.50 - 200 daytime minutes , unlimited evenings/weekends 5pm -lrb- aka killer plan -rrb- $ 16.00 - value pack -lsb- call/name display , enhanced voicemail , whocalled , 2500 text msgs -rsb- $ 6.95 - system access fee $ 0.50 - 911 emergency fee i will be buying an unlocked htc dream from my friend soon and i want to add the $ 25/500 mb data option to my already existing plan .
would i run into any issues by doing this ?
i have a feeling they might say that because my voice plan is an older one that i ca n't combine it with a new data option .
anyone have experience with this ?
thanks in advance .
