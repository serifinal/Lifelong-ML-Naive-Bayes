blackberry international unlimited e-mail plan .
now i know this topic has been discussed to death with some people claiming they get charged for non email use overseas while others like myself have had quite the opposite experience .
there is new thread over at crackberry that suggest that this loophole for people like me has been recently closed and that i will now start getting data charges after 3-4 years without them on my regular travels .
crackberry forum link i will not travel abroad until late august to find out for myself so i thought i would ask the hofo experts what alarms me is that up until now my on my invoice data use has always showed as `` rim blackberr '' for all data used .
i now seem to have entries on my last invoice that also show `` internet acce '' which i have never seen before in my 4 years with t-mobile .
also around the same time i replaced my 8700 with a new bold blackberry so i 'm not sure if this is a coincidence or part of a new way of reporting data use so that they can start charging me for the overseas roaming .
