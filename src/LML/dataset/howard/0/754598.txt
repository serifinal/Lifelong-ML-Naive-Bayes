ca n't make phone calls but can receive .
hi recently i purchased an unlocked gsm a sunno s880 running windows mobile 6.5 .
my service provider is fido , my issue currently is that i can receive calls , surf the net , send and receive sms but i cant make outgoing calls it just does not connect .
i do n't know what to do , i went to fido and they said maybe it needs to be unlocked again and i went to two places and they both said maybe i got to manually enter the network code but i dont even know how to do that .
any help would be great i really want to get this phone up and running .
