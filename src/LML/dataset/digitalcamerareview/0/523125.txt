cannon powershot sd850 is .
video conversion .
i just purchased a cannon powers shot sd850 is , i love the camera but i am running into a lot of problems when i try to use the videos i took .
the format mvi is not compatible with the windows movie maker or even windows media player .
i spent several hours searching the web for converters but all they do is produce a video with a gray screen and the audio .
has anyone else run into this problem ?
i tried contacting customer support and all they said was search the web .
i am becoming very frustrated .
any help would be much appreciated .
