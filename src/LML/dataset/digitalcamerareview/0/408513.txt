having problems copying video file from canon ixus to hard drive .
hey everyone .
i 'm new here .
i own a canon ixus 130 .
last week , using this camera , i took an 8-minute video of u2 performing `` city of blinding lights '' and `` vertigo '' at their final concert in canada .
right now , i 'm having a difficult time transferring this video file from my canon ixus to the hard drive on my dell inspiron 1525 laptop .
scanner and camera wizard would give me two error messages : `` the current picture could not be copied '' `` not enough storage is available to complete this operation '' i 've already removed unnecessary programs and deleted massive amounts of music/movie/word files from my computer .
yet , i keep getting the same error messages from scanner and camera wizard over and over again .
usually , i 'd never have problems transferring pictures and videos from my canon ixus to my computer .
this one 8-minute video is the first that i 've had troubles copying .
what could be going wrong ?
what else could i do to successfully transfer this one video from my camera to my computer ?
