not sure how the sd1200 face detection works , focus box etc .
1 .
there is a green focus box in auto mode , i ca n't control what it focuses on . .
does that mean if it focuses on something to the right , it wo n't focus on what i 'm point at in the center ?
2 .
i thought this has face detection .
i mean it does , but i do n't know how to activate it . .
it does n't do the white/gray boxes over faces , how do i do that ?
