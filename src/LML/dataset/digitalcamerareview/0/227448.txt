sx210is video problems .
hi i hope somebody could perhaps give me a little advice .
i recently purchased a sx210is camera , i 'm really pleased with the photos it takes but the video quality is awful .
when i play back any video the resolution is really low even though i 've got my settings at 1080 .
i 've connected the camera to my computer via the usb cable that came with the camera and i 'm connected to the tv through a hdmi cable and both give me the same results .
i 've tried filming in all three quality settings and there is no difference in quality .
i 'm a complete novice when it comes to photography so i realise i may be doing something very basic wrong , but i 'm at a complete loss as to what i 'm doing wrong .
any advice would be really welcomed .
thank you
