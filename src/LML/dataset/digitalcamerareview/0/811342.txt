continuous shooting on the sx10is .
hi , new on this forum .
just purchased one of these .
trying to figure out all the functions and i am having a hard time getting the fastest setting for continuous shooting ie 1.4 fps .
i know p108 in the manual describes the continuous shooting mode but it does n't say what setting your camera has to be in in order to get 1.4 fps .
i have tried different ones but am unsuccessful .
i am new to this camera , as we owned a kodakz812is before this ... which had a burst mode .
any help is much appreciated .
thanks , joeb .
