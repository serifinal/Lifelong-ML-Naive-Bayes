canon ios1100d digiscope attachment .
does anyone know if there is a bracket available to attach a canon ios1100d slr camera to an rspb ag60 scope ?
i believe the rspb scopes are made by viking optics ?
and i 'm told they do not do make an attachment to suit my 1100d slr .
does anyone know of any universal attachments ?
help !
