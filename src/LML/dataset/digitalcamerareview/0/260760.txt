joby gorillapod slr tripod review .
ever since i saw the first gorillapod , i &#8217; ve been intrigued to see how well it performs .
&#160; then , when joby introduced the gorillapod slr , i was especially interested to see if it could handle my olympus e-500 digital slr .
&#160; the bulk of my photography -lrb- outside of camera review shots -rrb- is family and vacation shooting .
&#160; i rarely use a tripod for these purposes , but the gorillapod is small enough that it would be easy to keep with me .
-lrb- view large image -rrb- &#160; the first gorillapod model was meant only for compact digital cameras weighing up to 9.1 ounces &#8211; not enough for some of the ultra-zoom cameras or digital slrs .
&#160; then came the gorillapod slr , which can handle a camera up to 1.75 pounds .
&#160; finally , for those who have the really long glass &#8211; the gorillapod slr-zoom can handle up to 6.6 pounds.design and featuresi picked up the gorillapod slr to review .
&#160; it actually shares pretty much the same features as the smaller , lighter weight gorillapod with everything just upsized a bit .
with the legs straightened and folded together , the tripod has a height of just under 10 inches , making it very packable .
&#160; in fact , if you don &#8217; t have room for a cylindrical shape just a couple inches in diameter , you could mold the gorillapod to fit in whatever you have space left for .
&#160; at only 5.8 ounces , it is also very lightweight.the tripod is essentially made of a bunch of &#8220; ball and socket &#8221; joints so that the legs can be bent to whatever shape you need .
&#160; the tips of the legs are almost entirely covered with rubber for grippiness .
&#160; the rest of the ball joints have rings of rubber to grip whatever they &#8217; re wrapped around.moving up to the tripod head , a &#8220; slim-line attachment &#8221; slides out to allow easy attachment to your camera .
&#160; once the attachment is tightened into the tripod mount on you camera , you just slide it into the head until it clicks .
&#160; a push-button release holds the attachment into place .
&#160; for extra security , a rotating ring lock prevents the push button from being depressed and releasing the slim-line attachment .
&#160; both the gorillapod and gorillapod slr have the same head .
&#160; the gorillapod slr-zoom has a screw mount that allows a 1/4 &#8221; or 3/8 &#8221; mount to whatever camera or tripod head that you prefer.slim-line attachment and lock ring -lrb- view large image -rrb- performancethe gorillapod really does excel at what it &#8217; s meant for .
&#160; there &#8217; s no doubt that it &#8217; s flexible enough to handle an infinite number of positions .
&#160; the rubberized feet and joints are absolutely critical to getting the tripod to &#8220; stick &#8221; and they do a good job .
&#160; the holding power of the tripod is also sufficient for my olympus digital slr .
&#160; not every position is as stable as you may prefer , but it just takes a little adjustment to get there .
-lrb- view large image -rrb- my only concern with the &#8220; holding &#8221; capability of the camera will probably only reveal itself with longer-term use .
&#160; i have a feeling that the joints will become less stiff with age -lrb- how come it doesn &#8217; t that work that way for people ? -rrb-
and it will become more difficult to find a stable position .
&#160; however , the gorillapod is so reasonably priced that it &#8217; s easily replaced .
-lrb- view large image -rrb- as i played with it , i realized that half of the fun is just bending it to get the best platform to shoot from .
&#160; it &#8217; s also just fun to play with even if you aren &#8217; t going to do any shooting .
&#160; apparently , i &#8217; m not the only one who thinks the same - you should see the flickr gorillapod love pool : http://www.flickr.com/groups/gorillapod/pool/the slim-line attachment and locking mechanism may seem like a little thing , but it provides a lot of value and ease of use .
&#160; you can purchase an additional slim-line attachment clips so you can leave them on multiple cameras.purchase optionsyou can purchase directly from the joby website , but they also have a list of places where you can purchase it .
&#160; i also was impressed that you can get an &#8220; unpackaged &#8221; , environmentally-friendly version of the gorillapod slr that is $ 5 less than the blister-packed version .
&#160; the gorillapod slr-zoom only comes unpackaged and the standard gorillapod comes in both versions with a $ 3 difference.conclusionas i walked past joby 's booth at the photoplus expo a few weeks ago , i overheard someone say that they would n't trust it to hold their equipment on the other hand , i looked at the crowd of people at the booth and noticed how many people were actually purchasing the model that fit their needs .
as with any product , it 's not going to satisfy everyone , but it 's an excellent product that performs very well for its price -lrb- and target audience -rrb- .
it also happens that it 's darn cute.the gorillapod slr -lrb- and the rest of its band -rrb- is a perfect miniature tripod solution for amateurs and enthusiasts who don &#8217; t need a more expensive tripod for everyday use .
&#160; it &#8217; s also a good travel tripod for anyone who doesn &#8217; t want to/need to travel with a standard sized tripod .
