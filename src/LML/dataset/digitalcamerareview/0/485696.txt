reset to factory settings .
re : canon powershot sd1300 is i take photos of diamonds using macro mode .
the first pictures i took were perfect .
then i changed the factory settings .
what are the factory settings for white balance , etc ?
the photo on the left was taken before i changed settings .
the photo on the right was taken after i changed settings .
i need to return to all the factory settings .
thanks ,
