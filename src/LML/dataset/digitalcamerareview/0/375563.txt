replacing the lcd screen in my sd790is help ? .
about 2 years ago i replaced the lcd screen in my canon sd400 , no big whoop .
due to some circumstances beyond my control , my canon sd790is got ran over by a car .
the camera amazingly survived with only a cracked lcd .
i disassembled the exterior of the camera and removed the old lcd screen , but the ribbon cable on the 790is is in a substantially different place than on the sd400 ... i have no idea how to connect a new one .
do i need to remove the shutter button to access the ribbon connector ?
thanks , atek3
