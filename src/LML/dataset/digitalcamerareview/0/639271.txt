canon 350d .
my husband bought me a canon 350d rebel used and it is wonderful just have a few questions as i am still learning the camera .
the other night i was at the beach with a friend and we wanted to take some pictures when i put it on the night setting it seemed that the shutter froze for a second in between shots is this just the way that setting works or is it a bigger issue ?
