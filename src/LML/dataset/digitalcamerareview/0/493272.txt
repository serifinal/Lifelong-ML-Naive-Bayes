sd870is - colors look flat ?! .
is it just me , or do the colors look flat ?
i 've been pretty happy with my new 870is but after uploading the images to my comp for the first time i was a little disappointed .
granted they 've been indoor shots -lrb- mostly florescent lighting though -rrb- , but i was hoping for something a little punchier .
i now started shooting everything with vivid coloring and i hope that will work , but if you guys have any other suggestions i 'd really appreciate it .
