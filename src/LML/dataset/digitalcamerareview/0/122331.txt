any a720 is users ? .
i just got my a720 and are learning to use it .
when i am taking a shot in auto mode nothing is displayed in the lcd screen either before or after i depress the button half way and the green light does not come on , only the orange light .
according to the users manuel the scene should be displayed on the lcd screen with the af frames displayed in green .
it appears that the auto focus is not working .
again , nothing is shown on the screen , until i fully depress the button and the picture is taken .
it will take the picture fine and display the picture after the picture is taken .
am i missing something .
any help appreciated thanks , don
