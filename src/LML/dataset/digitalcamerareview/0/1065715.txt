blurry photos canon sx130 .
i just came back from a trip and my photos turned out awesome .
two days later i used my canon and all the photos turned out blurry .
i put the settings back to default and the photos when i use zoom are still blurry .
i have recharged my batteries and changed the memory card .
any other suggestions ?
