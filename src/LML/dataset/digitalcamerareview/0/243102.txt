zoom does n't work .
after 2 years ' of use and over 80,000 photos , my canon powershot sd 600 developed a problem with the zoom ring .
it no longer works .
it still can take photos but only at the fixed 5.8 mm .
it refuses to go into telephoto or digital zoom .
to have it repaired would cost more than a new camera .
my question is how long is the average life for a digital camera that is often used ?
i expected the motor that retracts the lens to break first .
which part usually breaks first in a digital camera ?
