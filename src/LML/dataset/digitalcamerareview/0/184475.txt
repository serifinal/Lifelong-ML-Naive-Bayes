gray spot on my sd870 screen .
about 2 weeks ago , a gray spot appeared on the screen of my canon sd870 , which is not quite 2 years old .
it started out as a sort of a trapezoid , and expanded at the top and bottom until now it is perfectly circular .
it is slowly growing and it 's now 8 mm in diameter .
there 's a yellowish glow around it .
a few days after the spot appeared , a grey linear area appeared at the top of the screen , which is about 1 mm deep and extends about the middle third of the screen .
i figure that there 's probably nothing to be done about it and i 'm looking for a new camera , but i 'm curious as to what is wrong with it .
the camera still takes pictures just fine .
i used it to take pictures on a sunday and the spot was n't there .
i looked at the pictures a day or two later and it had appeared .
i did n't drop it or anything like that .
there were no magnets nearby -lrb- not sure if that would affect it -rrb- .
i was carrying it in my purse .
what is happening to the screen ?
did i do something that i can avoid in the future ?
thanks for any help .
