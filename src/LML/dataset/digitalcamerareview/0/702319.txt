seeking canon user guides for a610 , i lost mine .
hello , i lent my canon a610 to a friend with the basic and advanced user guides that came with it .
ofcourse the camera was returned sans users guides .
i 've downloaded them from the canon website in pdf format but i do n't really want to print them of on letter sized paper .
does anyone knew where you could order new user guides printed and binded like the origonals .
thanks .
