lowepro shows off the slingshot 300 aw camera bag at the photoplus expo .
at this year 's photoplus expo , lowepro came prepared to satisfy the wishes of the professional photographer .
&#160; joining two smaller models , they added a new slingshot 300 aw sling backpack to accomodate larger professional camera bodies with an attached long zoom lens .
&#160; -lrb- view large image -rrb- at last year 's show , lowepro introduced the slingshot 100 aw and 200 aw .
&#160; with a highly functional sling design , photographers can move quickly from &#8220; carry &#8221; to &#8220; shoot &#8221; .
&#160; however , the first two bags weren &#8217; t quite large enough for professionals with larger bodies and a larger stable of lenses .
&#160; the bags also included a weatherproof cover that stows away in a hidden pouch.lowepro responded by introducing the slingshot 300 aw , which is large enough to hold a &#8220; pro &#8221; camera body and five to six additional lenses , flash units , memory cards and personal accessories .
&#160; to handle the larger weight , a waist strap was added.i stopped by lowepro &#8217; s booth at the show to get a tour of the bag .
&#160; while it &#8217; s &#8220; just &#8221; a larger version of the previously introduced bags , they didn &#8217; t just increase the dimensions of the bag .
&#160; they paid attention to how the bag would change .
&#160; it &#8217; s going to carry more , so they added a waist strap .
&#160; since a standard padded waist strap could get in the way in &#8220; shoot &#8221; mode , they added something as simple as a seam so that the strap would fold .
&#160; a strap acts as a zipper stop so the main pouch doesn &#8217; t open accidentally to dump your stuff .
&#160; so , overall , i was pretty impressed with the bag.the slingshot 300 aw has an msrp of $ 129 and will start to be available , in limited quantities at first , in about 3 weeks .
