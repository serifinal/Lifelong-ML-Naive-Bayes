spot on all pictures with canon eos rebel t3 - help ! .
so yesterday i noticed a black spot in my pictures .
i removed my filter ... the lense ... etc. . .
and did n't find anything that would cause such a prominent black spot on all pictures .
it gets more transparent when not focused on a subject , but i just ca n't figure it out .
i 'm new to this and do n't want to risk taking my camera apart too much .
i cleaned everything and still ... it 's there .
any ideas as to what it could be ?
here are some examples : http://www.dropbox.com/gallery/48738916/1/spot?h=74835b
