file size of photos .
i bought a canon sx110 a couple of weeks ago and i noticed that the first bunch of pictures i took had a .
jpg file size of between 1.8 mb to 2.5 mb ... .
and then after i fiddles with things a bit the file sizes are much larger now , bgetting up over 5mb .
is this normal ?
the sizes seem kinda large to me .
taking a variety of color and b&w fotos with different zooms .
will that make a difference in file size ?
any other settings that i may have misconfigured ?
thanks in advance for the advice !
hugh
