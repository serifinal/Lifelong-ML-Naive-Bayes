lcd problem a570 is .
new camera a570 is just got the camera and learning how to use it .
if i do not use the flash the lcd refreshes within a second or two of taking a picture and allows me to take another picture .
if i use the flash , it shows the preview of the image that was just taken .
but the lcd goes black and never refreshes so that you can take another picture , you have to press the display 5 times to get the lcd to refresh .
any idea what could be causing this .
thanks charlie crimmel
