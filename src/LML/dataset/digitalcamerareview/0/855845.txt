my canon a610 dead already ? .
my camera has been sitting on my desk , untouched for a few weeks now .
last time i used it , it was for my review on nbr .
i go to use my camera , and there is no image ??! everything else works .
i can take a picture , -lrb- but it just shows up black -rrb- i look on the display , and i can see the items like pics left , but no image .
i call canon , and they did n't know what to do -lrb- since we tried everything -rrb- so im about to send it in .
today i go to turn it on , and now it doesnt even turn on .
so , i hope i get this one fixed , or just a new one .
why would this happen though ?
