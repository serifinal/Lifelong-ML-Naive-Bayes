canon sx10is .
i am new at this but i do need help .
a month ago i bought sx10is .
upgrading i thought from a s2is , but it is not working for me .
i can not get macro - super macro to work - either it is focused but washed out too light or it is not focused but right colours - tried a lot of thing but not working - i am about to give up and go back to my old camera
