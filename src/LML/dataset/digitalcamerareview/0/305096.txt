how many photos remaining ? .
i recently purchased a canon sd 600 .
it takes nice photos but i can not tell how many photos remain on the sd memory card .
the number on the lower right is supposed to indicate the number of remaining photos but it does n't make sense .
it recently indicated the # 775 , how could 775 photos remain on a 1gb sd card ?
i was already on photo 348 !
i set the camera to `` l '' and normal .
in the past , i suddenly got caught on the road with a blinking indicator saying no memory is left .
there must be a way to know exactly how many shots remain .
