eos 1000d - zeikos flash not firing .
hi - i 've recently bought a 1000d -lrb- rebel xs -rrb- and a zeikos 680ex ettl flash .
the flash worked great the first time i put it on the camera .
now , it does n't fire .
the flash ready light never comes on , the built-in works if i take the zeikos off .
menu settings have external enabled and ttl mode set .
i 'm new to digital , but am an experienced 35mm guy .
please help .
thanks .
