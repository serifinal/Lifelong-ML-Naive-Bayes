white spots on sd870is model pictures ? .
i purchased the canon powershot sd870 is camera before christmas .
so our family christmas celebrations were the first shots i took on the camera .
when i got the pictures back , there were mysterious white spots on many of the pictures .
sometimes they were tiny - pen head size - and other times they were the size of a dime .
they moved around - they were never in the same place in any of the photos so i did n't think there was just a spot on the lens .
i exchanged the camera thinking there was an issue , but the same model i brought home today appears to be doing the same thing .
i have n't developed the photos yet , but i can see on the lcd where there are small white spots on a few of the photos .
i use the auto mode - i have n't changed any of the settings on the camera .
so the flash is on with most of the photos since i have been taking inside shots .
have you ever heard of this problem and what am i doing wrong ?!
