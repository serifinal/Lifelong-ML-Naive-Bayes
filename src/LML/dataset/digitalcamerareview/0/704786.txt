sd4500 sound quality .
i got an sd4500 and the sound quality really stinks .
i have tried recording in my house , in the yard , and in a closet with the door closed .
their is so much ambient noise that it covers the voices .
my old powershot was the same way .
appreciate the new hd , but wish they would work on microphone quality .
