video error messages .
hi all i have a canon a650is .
up until recently , every time i used it to shoot a video it would transfer fine to my computer in avi format .
i could play the videos with windows media player and i could edit them with canon zoom browser .
so far so good .
one day recently i noticed that the icon of a video i had just shot and transferred to the pc had changed .
instead of the thumbnail consisting of a still from the video , it had an avi logo and would not play in windows media player .
this is the same for all the videos i have shot since this point , although they can still be uploaded and played normally in youtube .
obviously my first thought was a problem with windows media player , so i reinstalled it to no avail .
and neither can the videos be edited in either zoom browser or movavi video converter , suggesting that the problem is with them and not what i am trying to play them with .
i have n't altered any of the settings onthe camera .
any ideas what might have happened ?
thanks mark
