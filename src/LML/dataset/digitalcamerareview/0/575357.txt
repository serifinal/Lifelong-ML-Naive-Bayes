870 self-timer question .
is there anyway to turn off the self-timer lamp , the blinking orange light that goes off when one uses the self-timer .
i 've tried turning off the red eye and af-assist beam , but the self timer lamp is still active .
is there anyway to deactivate the light while still being able to use the self-timer , it 's just annoying when useing the camera , with the self-timer , in a dark , crowded room .
thank you
