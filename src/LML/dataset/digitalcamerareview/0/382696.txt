new powershot sx220 hs in a whitebox reconditioned ? .
hi .
i just received my new powershot sx220 hs , the thing is it came in a plain white box with no lettering or anything on the outside with only an intact silver security seal , when i opened the box my camera was sitting on few pieces of what looked like tissue paper .
now i paid full price for this camera from a large online retailer in the uk , have a received a reconditioned camera ?
thanks john .
