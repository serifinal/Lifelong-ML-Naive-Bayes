ca n't figure this out ! .
i am a teacher , and use a canon digital rebel with great success .
love , love , love , the camera!i am responsible for taking pictures with santa at our school open house .
i usually just shoot and hope for the best .
is there a way to hook my camera to an external monitor , or my laptop , while i am taking pictures so my partners at the desk will be able to see if the shot was good before the kids leave the photo area ?
i 've been googling for two hours , and ca n't find an answer , maybe because i 'm not phrasing the question correctly !
