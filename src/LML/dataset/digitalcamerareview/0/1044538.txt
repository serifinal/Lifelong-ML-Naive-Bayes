rebel xt - cf card capacity regarding .
my rebel xt does not seem to support 4 gb cf card .
it works well with 2 gb cards .
has anyone used a 4 gb cf card on their rebel xt or 350 d ?
after formatting the cf card with the in camera format option , the camera takes about 16 - 18 shots before displaying `` err cf '' i think the rebel xt is right in rejecting the 4 gb card for the following reason .
the display of balance shots is a 3 digit counter with a maximum display of 999 .
theoretically , the 4gb would have a capacity 1000 + shots , which the display can not show the user .
what are your comments on this ?
