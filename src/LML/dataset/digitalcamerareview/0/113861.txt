cleaning my rebel xt .
any ideas on cleaning your camera ?
i 've noticed dark areas on pictures that have to be dust somewhere in my camera .
i clean my lenses all the time so i do n't think the dust is there .
if there is a thread pertaining to this topic i 'm sorry , please direct me to it .
if not , i 'd love some ideas before i dive in with a lens cloth wiping stuff that should not be wiped .
thanks , andrew
