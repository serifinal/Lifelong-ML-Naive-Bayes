nikon d40x to see replacement in 2008 ?
the latest hearsay , courtesy of a source translation obtained by photography bay , is that nikon intends to replace the step-up d40x digital slr with an all-new d60 in early 2008 .
apparently , the rumor is based on credible reports that d40x manufacturing is being closed down .
from all indications , the original 6 megapixel d40 will remain in production for the foreseeable future.if the information proves well sourced , earlier rumors of a d80x/d90 replacement for the d80 may not pan out after all .
whether this means that the aging d70/d80 line gets dropped altogether is not clear .
