canon eos 50d image quality .
5 months ago i bought a canon eos 50d body to complement the eos 20d i already had for its larger raw image size ; i have used the same lens -lrb- ef70-200 f4l usm -rrb- on both bodies , but ca n't seem to duplicate the 20d 's image sharpness with the 50d even with mirror lockup & rs-80n3 remote switch on both bodies using a very stable bogen tripod .
the 20d just keeps exhibiting a sharper image regardless of the subject ; i am interested if anyone else has encountered a similar situation or could offer a solution .
