powershot s5 is problem .
hi , i 'm a newbie on this forum but have a problem with my powershot s5 is .
yesterday , i was surprised when my camera suddenly started overexposing photos on the `` auto '' setting .
although indoor shots are of course less severe , images in direct sunlight are really washed out .
contrast still seems okay , but it just looks like the camera let too much light in .
i first tried a reset using the menus in the camera with no success .
i then tried canon customer support , but since i 've had my camera for just under three years , they only referred me to factory service .
mainly , i 'm wondering if any of you know what the problem is , and if it is repairable -lrb- i 'm handy , but want to troubleshoot first -rrb- .
any ideas what is wrong ?
thanks in advance for your advice !
tim
