canon `` nifty fifty '' trouble .
has anyone experienced trouble with their 50mm lens `` sticking '' at the wide apeture ?
i am pretty new to all of this .
i have a fixed 50mm lens that i can not adjust the apeture beyond 1.8 / 2.0 .
i see the `` bulb '' signal in my view finder .
has anyone experienced this or know how to fix this problem before i go out to seek help and have the lense inspected ?
i have a rebel xti .
in any of the settings - manual , tv , av or auto - the lense will not adjust beyond 2.0 help - as this is my favorite lense !!!
thank you .
