sd800is-is this common when purchased new . .
i just purchased a canon sd800is from 42nd street photo through the internet .
http://www.42photo.com/ i 'm wondering if this is common to all sd800is when new .
the box had been opened and the warranty card had something torn off the bottom .
it still had the customer info to fill out and send in .
the lcd screen did n't have a protective coating to peel off which is common on new electronics and there was lint in the corners of the screen , as if it may have been wiped .
i called them and they said that the portion of the warranty card torn off was a dealer portion and the screen on those models doesnt come with a peel away cover .
he said the box does n't come sealed on those models .
he said this was new and not refurbished .
if this the case with all sd800is or should i think about returning this and purchase through someone else .
