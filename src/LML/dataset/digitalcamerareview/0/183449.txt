please help , possible problem with 700 is ! .
hey , i just purchased a 700is today , and noticed that the camera makes a slight whirring sound when i gently press down on the shutter button .
it makes a similar sound when zooming in and out .
i 'm a little -lrb- well ... very -rrb- worried that the camera is defective .
can some one who has the 700 is see if they can hear any noise when doing this actions ?
i may be going back to the store to listen to the store model , but i would like to have some other opinions .
thanks , night_2004
