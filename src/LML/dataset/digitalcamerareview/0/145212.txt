sd600 higher resolution 2.5 lcd than others .
i have noticed that the specs on canon 's website show that the 2.5 lcd on the sd600 have 173,000 and all the other sd 's with 2.5 lcd have 115,000 .
can anyone verify this ?
also , the sd630 with the 3 inch lcd has 173,000 , so you get a half an inch with no more pixels .
