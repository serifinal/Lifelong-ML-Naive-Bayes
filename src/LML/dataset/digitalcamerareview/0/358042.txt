black dot in some pictures but not everyone .
hello i did a google search to find out whats wrong with my cannon powershot a570 is .
it does n't do this all the time , were there 's nothing wrong with it .
then other times like on road trips this black dot shows up in the left corner , and you can see it on the screen .
i 'm starting to think its dust or somthing .
