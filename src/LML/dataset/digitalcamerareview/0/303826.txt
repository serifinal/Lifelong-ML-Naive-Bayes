can any one help w / a590 ?? .
i orginaly bought a nikon coolpix l 18 after being talked into and ended up going back and getting the canon a590 is but when i got home read the manual and stared shooting it was really , really slow some pics came out blurry not all .
the slowness is what started to get to me .
i kept it in easy mode as well , same thing .
i ended up getting really frusturated and took it back and got the coolpix again .
i just wanted to upgrade i was using a kodak z740 before now i am sitting here wandering if i made mistake with keeping the coolpix ?
any suggestions ?
thanks
