canon sx10 is has terrible picture quality ! .
i am appalled by the bad picture quality of the sx10 model !
the digital noise is horrible !
here are two photos of the same object , the first one was made with the old cheap canon a620 and the second one was made with sx10 is , both on automatic setting , both using their flash .
canon a620 canon sx10 is how can any respected digital camera reviewer recommend to anyone buying sx10 is beyond comprehension !
the digital noise is always present with sx10 , its pictures are always full of it , even with iso 80 .
nothing looks real on sx10 photos !
i am returning the camera tomorrow for a full refund .
what a waste of my time it was ... if you are thinking of buying canon sx10 ... do n't !!
