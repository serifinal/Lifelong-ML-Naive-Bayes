advice/help 350d .
hi i am new and hope that i have posted this request in the correct place .
i have a 350d and bought it just after they were released to replace the 300d with two batteries .
i have excellent service from the camera but this last month it has started to behave oddly .
i have had error 99 which the book indicates is a battery problem but this is intermitent .
the flash tends to operate on a delay and flashes a number of times before firing .
the display indicates that the battery is fully charged .
does anyone know if this is a battery problem -lrb- in my case two batteries -rrb- or is it something to do with the camera and potentially more serious ?
many thanks is advance alan south coast uk .
