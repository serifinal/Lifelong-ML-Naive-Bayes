blank screen - powershot a430 .
my camera is several years old but still takes great photos .
however , the only way to take a picture now is using the optical viewfinder as the view screen will not show a picture being taken , but will allow me to view a picture that has already been taken .
any ideas ?
i am wondering if i somehow changed a setting that i can correct , or is my camera just breaking ?
thanks !
