problem with printed pictures vs picture display on camera .
hi all !
i recently got a new canon powershot sd780 is as a gift and so far i love it .
the only problem i am having is that sometimes it seems as though the images that are printed out are a bit off centered -lrb- either side to side or up and down -rrb- from what is displayed on the screen .
any idea what could be causing this or how to fix it ?
i do n't know much about the customized settings and always use my camera on the auto options .
any help would be much appreciated !
thanks !
