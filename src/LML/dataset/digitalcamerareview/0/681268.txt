excessive battery use -lrb- s1 -rrb- .
i have had a canon s1 since may of 2005 .
it worked pretty well until a trip to the toronto zoo in the summer .
it chewed through 5 sets of batteries that day .
i had brought 4 sets with me thinking it was overkill , but i 'd be safe .
i had to run to the shop there to buy more .
now , i know i was doing a lot of zooming , but i only took 200-250 pictures .
i 'm going to wait til after christmas to bring it in for repair .
what i would love to do is to upgrade it to the s2 .
the s2 came out just after i bought the s1 and i would have picked up the s2 if it had have been out .
has anyone heard of an upgrade program ?
also , i 'm wondering what happens if they ca n't fix the battery problem ?
by the looks of it they are n't making the s1 any more .
does anyone have any experience with canon 's repair service ?
