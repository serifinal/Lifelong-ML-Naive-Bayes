help w / cannon sd850is .
i got my camera today .
i find it to be very time consuming to take a photo with flash .
and then it takes forever to take another picture .
this causes me to have to make family wait many seconds to take a photo .
i like the quality of the photos this camera takes but for some reason this camera has the slowest speed .
i have a 5 year old olympus that i consider slow and this camera is just as slow .
if i focus in halfway on the shutter and then press it , it still take a long time to take a photo .
