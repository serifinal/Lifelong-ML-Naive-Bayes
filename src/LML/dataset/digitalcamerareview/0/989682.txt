taking concert photos with a canon powershot sx20 .
i am new to photography and bought the canon powershot sx20 .
i have filmed for a number of years and recently became interested in taking photos .
i go to many concerts and take as many photos as i can .
last night i went to a concert and still have yet to figure out how to take photos without grain in them etc. .
the pictures are sometimes blurry even though the settings are usually the same during every picture .
i have the camera set to program mode , iso 400 , and exposure i usually leave unless the lighting drastically changes on the stage .
the image quality is set to large and i used the flash as i was back a ways a good 50 feet maybe .
i had the digital zoom on to 1.5 x so i get up close .
any tips how i can improve my photos ?
thanks
