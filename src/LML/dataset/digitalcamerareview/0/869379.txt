s5 - slow when taking auto with flash .
hi everyone - i seem to be missing a ton of shots because i go to take the pic and my camera wo n't shoot - then i have to wait a few secs , hold down the shutter slightly until frame locks in , then i can take the shot -lrb- for canon users - i hold down until i hear the beeping `` lock in '' noise and then can take the shot -rrb- .
what is going on with it ?!
