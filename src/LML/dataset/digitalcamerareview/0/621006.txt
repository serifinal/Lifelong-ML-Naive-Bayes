on the canon digi cameras , better to use lcd or rangefinder ? .
my newest set of canon cameras , that i have accumulated over the years is a a570 is .
i have to admit that i do find the a series having excellent value .
here is my question : will i get more accurate photos by looking at my lcd display instead of my viewfinder ??
i much prefer the view finder , from years of taking photos as well as the ability to block out other views .
i think that looking at the lcd is always better for close up shots ??? true ??
please help me .
i am having a quasi-debate with my son .
thanks , jon temple
