a590 is registration question .
hi guys , great site you have here .
after reading alot of the comments and reviews on the a590 is and its predecessor the a570 is on the site i 've decided to return my recently purchased nikon l18 in favor of the a590 .
it really is a great camera and i 'm anxious to dig into the users guide to try and gain an understanding of all it 's functions as this is my first camera .
i went to register my camera online though and the a590 is not listed in the pulldown menu and i 'm wondering if anyone knows why or could suggest what i should do . .
