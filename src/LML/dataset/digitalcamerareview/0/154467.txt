powershot gets hot , wo n't turn on ... .
yesterday , a friend put some energizer lithium batteries in my powershot 570 a is camera .
i took a picture , turned off the power , and set it aside .
later , i went to pick it up , and it felt like was baking in an oven !
extremely hot to the touch .
i took the batteries out of the camera , and they were blistered and melting .
today , i put some regular duracells into the camera .
i turned it on , but it went dead immediately .
two minutes later , it 's burning hot and wo n't turn on at all .
i took out those duracells , replaced them with another pair of duracells , same thing , instead it wo n't turn on at all , and it 's still heating up .
the heat seems to be coming from the side of the camera opposite to the battery terminal .
it wo n't turn on , and unless i remove the batteries , it 's extremely hot .
i hope i wo n't have to buy a new one , anyone else have this problem , and can it be fixed ?
