canon powershot a95 .
i got a canon powershot a95 a couple years ago , to take with me when i went studying abroad .
in the beginning , the camera took reasonable quality photos - nothing spectacular - but since last year or so , the image quality has reduced drastically .
i do n't know much about digital cameras , since i am a film guy ... any help on what to do would be great -lrb- or even just telling me to throw the piece of junk out -rrb- .
thanks .
