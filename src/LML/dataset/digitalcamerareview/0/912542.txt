unable to insert sd card into sd700is .
i have a 2006 canon powershot sd700is .
the camera was functioning normally until a month back .
i tired to take the sd card out of the camera to transfer the images , but it would n't come out .
i could push the memory card and it would pop out slightly , but i could not remove it from the camera .
on the lcd screen the camera said it could not write to the sd card since the card was locked .
so i had to take out the card .
i used a lot of force , i broke the sd card and finally took the card out .
now i ca n't insert another card into the memory .
i would like to try all means to repair the camera before i give up and buy another camera .
i would appreciate any comments or suggestions to help me fix my camera .
