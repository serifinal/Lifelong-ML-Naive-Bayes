kodak easyshare z612 digital camera first thoughts .
image stabilized -lrb- is -rrb- mega-zoom digicams are currently one of the hottest products in the high tech marketplace .
kodak 's first foray in this highly competitive arena , the kodak easyshare z612 , was designed to compete directly with canon 's s3 is , sony 's h5 , and panasonic 's fz7 .
all four cameras share remarkably similar features -- compact slr like bodies , good ergonomics , long zooms , and a broad range -lrb- auto , program , aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes -rrb- of exposure options .
the z612 , like its competition , tries to balance point-and-shoot convenience and enhanced usability with prosumer level flexibility and creative control .
-lrb- view large image -rrb- the kodak easyshare z612 features 6 megapixel resolution , a 12x schneider-kreuznach variogon optical zoom , and a 2.5 inch lcd screen .
af is fairly quick , but i could only count 6 steps -lrb- the sony h5 's af has 45 steps -rrb- and that makes it harder to frame images precisely and requires lots of unnecessary zooming with the feet .
kodak 's color science processor produces consistently sharp images with neutral color rendition -lrb- except for reds which are highly saturated in sharp contrast to the rest of the z612 's color spectrum -rrb- , accurate -lrb- caucasian -rrb- skin tones , and good shadow/highlight detail .
the z612 's lcd and evf are not very fluid , movement is a bit jerky and the lcd/evf freezes briefly when the shutter fires .
-lrb- view large image -rrb- how does the z612 stack up against its competition ?
the z612 has more warts than a bullfrog , but in the final analysis it 's all about the pictures and when it counts and where it counts -lrb- except for macro -rrb- the z612 delivers .
check back in a few days for the complete review .
