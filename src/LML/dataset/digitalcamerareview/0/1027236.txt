canon rebel xt - black and white mode ? .
i bought a canon rebel xt a few months ago .
i enjoy using the camera ... i was wondering if anybody knew if there is a black and white mode ?
i read in the manuel that there was that option under the menu ... but when i go through my camera options , it does n't appear .
is there something additional that i need to buy ?
thanks for any input .
