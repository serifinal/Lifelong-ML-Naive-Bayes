canon a100is making noises .
hello , i just purchased an cannon a1100is and i am noticing it making noises when i move the camera around .
it sounds like a whirring sound one after another almost like a focus motor or something and it also makes clicking noises alot .
i notice this most when camera is set on is continuous .
and in auto mode is it normal in is cameras to hear all these noises , i mean you can almost hear everything this camera is doing .
i have an a560 and it makes no noises except when zooming .
just trying to figure out if this is normal for canons with image stabilization or if something is wrong with it any help would be greatly appreciated !
thank you
