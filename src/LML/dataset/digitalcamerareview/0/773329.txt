what is a flat look ?
-lrb- sd700 -rrb- .
-lrb- copied from another forum -rrb- i read somewhere that someone said that the image stabilization on the sd700 gave the pictures an undesirable flat look .
he went on to say that it is better to turn off i.s. when it is likely the shutter will operate at a high speed , such as for outdoor shots in the sun .
what does it mean for a picture to look flat ?
i took some tripod shots with an sd700 , with i.s. on and off .
i could n't see any difference in the finished pictures .
-lrb- pictures analyzed on a computer screen enlarged to a 1 to 1 pixel match with the computer video -rrb- .
now if the i.s. when in action as needed for a handheld shot makes the picture look flat , then that means that had i.s. been turned off for that same shot , the shot would be blurry instead due to shaky hands .
i 'd prefer a sharp `` flat '' picture over a blurry picture any day .
