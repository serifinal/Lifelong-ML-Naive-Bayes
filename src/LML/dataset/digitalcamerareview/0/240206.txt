panasonic lumix ls80s announced .
panasonic has jumped the gun on even the pre-pma announcement field with the release of a new basic compact : the lumix ls80s.the release of this super-simple , user-friendly 8.1 megapixel compact hit the web today with about as much fanfare as could be expected for an entry level camera .
the features set covers the basics : 1/2 .5 - inch ccd , iso from 100 to 1600 , 3x zoom , and 2.5-inch screen .
the aa-powered digicam offers a limited range of user controls , focusing heavily on its scene and intelligent auto modes.the device is capable of capturing 16:9 -lrb- 848x480 -rrb- video clips at 30 fps as well .
the addition of panasonic 's mega o.i.s. optical image stabilization system is a plus , potentially previewing just how far down into many manufacturer 's lineups such technology may extended this release season .
no word on pricing or expected shelf release dates , but the ls80s is already showing up on panasonic 's website .
assuming the price comes in where we think it will , the ls80s , with its is system , could offer some serious competition to perennial low-budget thumpers like nikon 's l series .
