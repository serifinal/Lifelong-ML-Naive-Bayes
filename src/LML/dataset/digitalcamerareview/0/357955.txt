is canon power shot sx30 is software compatible with canon power shot a1100 is ? .
hello , i upgraded from a canon power shot a1100is to a canon power shot sx30 is .
will installing the new software for the sx30 is overwrite the software for the a1100 is and if so , can i still upload photos from the a1100 is .
i would like to continue using this camera also but am concerned the new software would n't be compatible .
thank you .
