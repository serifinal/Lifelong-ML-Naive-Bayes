lens cover for sx130 ? .
hello - i 'm new here , and i hope this wo n't seem like an irrelevant question .
i just bought another canon camera-the sx130is .
i think i like it pretty well .
my other canon , my point and shoot is a power shot a720is .
i have used it steadily for at least 2 years , and i think i have worn it out .
probably made 20-25 ,000 shots with it .
i carry it in my pocket constantly .
the main fault is that the lcd screen window is loaded with trash .
dust , pieces of grass , etc. .
once i actually saw a small living spider walking around inside there .
do n't know what happened to him !
so i want to take better care of my new toy , and thought a press-on/non-click type of lens cap might be available to fit it .
i looked at canon site and did not see anything applicable unless some lens caps might just coincidentally fit .
the actual measurement seems to be between 2 5/16 and 2 11/32 inches .
something near 59-60 mm ?
if anyone can help out with this , i will be greatful .
thanks , henry
