canon mirrorless camera - what do you want ? .
hey all , now that we know all about nikon 's new compact system camera i 'm wondering what you 'd all like to see - in theory - from a canon mirrorless system .
sensor size ?
accessories ?
rainbows and unicorns ?
speculation is half of the fun , right ?
