formating a memory card ? .
i was playing around with my camera and i was wondering what the format button would do so i clicked it and it did a process of some sort then when i tryed to look at my pictures they were all gone !
i have most of them saved but not all of them , is there anyway to get my pictures back or are they lost for good .
please anyone who knows the answer replay it would really help .
