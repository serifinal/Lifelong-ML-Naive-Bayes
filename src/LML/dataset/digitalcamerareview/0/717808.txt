powershot a510 maximum sd card size .
looking for the maximum card size that will work in my old powershot a510 .
the manual lists 512 as the highest , which at that time probably was about the biggest you could get .
my local store just sold me a sandisk 4 gb sdhc saying `` no problem '' and it wo n't format , just says memory card error .
anyone know for sure ?
thanks !
