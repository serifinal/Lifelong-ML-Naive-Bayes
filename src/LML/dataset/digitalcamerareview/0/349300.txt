canon sd-600 .
i got water into my canon sd-600 a few days ago while using in a rain shower .
i tried to keep it dry but water must have entered when the lens retracted as there are no other openings .
the cameras ' controls froze for about 1 hour but returned to service .
however , there are water droplets inside the lcd screen .
while these do n't seem to be on the photos , there are annoying blotches on the screen .
will they dry ever or is it ruined ?
