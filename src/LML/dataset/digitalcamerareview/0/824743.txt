old lenses usage on canon rebel eos t1i ? .
hi there , i recently bought the canon rebel eos t1i dslr .
i have recently been given some old lens that are compatible with the canon ae1 which is a manual film camera .
the lens obviously do n't fit the rebel but is there any kind of adapter on the market that i can buy so that these old lens will work with my new camera ?
thanks
