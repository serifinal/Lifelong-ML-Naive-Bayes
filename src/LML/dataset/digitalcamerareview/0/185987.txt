powershot a410 : photos come out blurry without flash on . .
i ca n't figure this out at all .
been messing around with all sorts of settings trying to get this to function properly .
if i have the flash on it works just fine , taking a good picture and all .
when the flash is off the photos come out blurry every single time .
what 's the deal ?
