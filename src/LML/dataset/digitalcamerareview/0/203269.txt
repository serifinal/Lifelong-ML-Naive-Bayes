blurry pics canon s2 is .
i 'm a new slr user - purchased my s2 is a couple of years ago and have spotty results -lrb- am sure it is user error not the camera . . -rrb- .
many pics are blurry - camera does n't seem to react to slight movements with subjects .
any tips on what settings i should check/alter would be appreciated !
i 'm almost at the point to going back to a point and shoot model as i think i 'm over my head with this slr
