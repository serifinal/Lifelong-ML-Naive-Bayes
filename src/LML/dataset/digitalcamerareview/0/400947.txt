which canon should i now go with ? .
i just had my canon sx10 stolen over the weekend .
for the most part , i was really happy with the sx10 .
i really just hated the continuous shooting .
my budget is $ 350 to $ 400 .
i see there is now a sx20 , and i 'm not sure about the sx1 .
any recommendations ?
