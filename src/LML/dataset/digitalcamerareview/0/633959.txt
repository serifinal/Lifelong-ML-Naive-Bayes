canon sx30 - windows xp - ca n't find driver .
hi , i bought a canon sx30 .
i 'm running windows xp - a custom install .
when i connect the camera to the computer using a usb cable windows detects the camera but can not find the drivers for the camera .
there are no drivers on the canon cd - only camera software .
yes , i did install the cd software before plugging in the camera .
windows ca n't even find drivers online .
i ca n't find any drivers on the canon websites either .
any suggestions ?
i 'm stuck .
thanks .
