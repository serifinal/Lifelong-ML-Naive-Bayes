sd850 is help !!! .
i have had the 850 is for about a year .
i 'm getting so frustrated that everytime i take a picture of a person indoors their eyes are red .
i have the red eye reduction on .
i am tired of having to correct every photo i take .
i would say 90 % of the photos have red eyes .
what am i doing wrong ??? is there another setting i am unaware of ?
is there a special technique on shooting indoors so as not to have red eyes ?
what the hell is causing this ?
it seems to be happening more with this digital camera than the early cannon i had .
help !!!!!!!! jdegid i have yahoo chat if you can take the time to chat about it as well jdegid@sbcglobal.net
