canon rebel replacement ? .
the following message came in via e-mail : i am strongly considering buying the digital rebel xt .
i have had two professional photographers tell me not to buy it because canon will be replacing the rebel in september .
i know its not likely considering both models of the rebel have been great sellers .
any truth to this rumor ?
