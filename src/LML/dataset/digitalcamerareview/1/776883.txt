s3 questions .
i am thinking of getting an s3 is .
i have a couple of questions how long is the battery life , i will be getting rechargeable but do not want to have to carry a ton of them with me ?
what is the max size of memory card it can take has anyone tried to use it in the inside , i will be going to disney world and want to attempt to use it on some of the rides , without a flash at high zooms is there a lot of noise , what about when going into the digital zoom are does a gorilla pod work nicely with this or is there a better tripod to carry with me
