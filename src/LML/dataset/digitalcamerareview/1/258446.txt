will lower file size improve image quality on s5 ? .
i have pretty much made the decision to purchase the powershot s5 , based on my recent experiences with the sd750 -lrb- blurry shots because no image stabilization -rrb- and the tz3 -lrb- washed out color and aggressive noise reduction software fuzzing out details -rrb- .
i know the s5 , like most non-dslr 's out there today , still suffers to some degree from mega pixel overdose and the nr software will fuzz out the detail to some degree .
my trusty old canon s400 -lrb- 4 mp -rrb- takes sharp photo 's i am satisfied with at the large setting of 2272 x 1704 pixels .
the max pixel setting on the s5 is 3264 x 2448 -lrb- jpeg super-fine -rrb- .
would reducing the image setting to 2592 x 1944 jpeg super-fine help ?
all the pro reviews i am reading say that trying to cram more pixels onto the same size sensors is what is killing image quality , so reducing the image size would seem to make sense - but i would like the opinion of someone that knows what they are doing please !
i have been very satisfied with the image quality of photo 's taken with th s400 , but would like a camera with better zoom , faster shutter time , and the ability to customize as i learn how to go beyond point and shoot .
the s5 , combined with the hot shoe to enable me to get a speedlight flash , seems to fit that bill while still being able to function as a ps for my wife .
your thoughts on the image size question would be very much appreciated , thank you !
