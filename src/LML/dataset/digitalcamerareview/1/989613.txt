s5 is vs s1 is .
hi everyone , i currently have a canon s1 is and i 'm considering upgrading to a canon s5 is .
can anyone tell me what has been improved on the s5 is ?
what features are different or better ?
i have had some issues with focusing with the s1 is , so i am wondering if that is better .
is it easier to use the manual focus on the s5 is ?
i ca n't really figure that out .
thanks !
