re : i want a slim canon digital camera ? .
hey there , i have a big problem .
i destroyed my camera completely it was one of those slim digital cameras and now i am in desperate need of a new one , but i decided to buy a bigger , more professional one for my traveling to paris .
i found several canon 's on the internet but i just ca n't decide which one i should buy , above all , because i do not have the slightest clue which camera is good and which one simply is not .
there are several single lens reflex canon eos cameras , but i do not know , because i am an absolute technical failure .
