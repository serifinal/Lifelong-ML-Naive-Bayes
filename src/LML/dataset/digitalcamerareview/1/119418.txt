canonsd **** is differences ? .
i tried searching for a thread as i 'm sure this may come up .
i 've been taking a liking to the canonsd-is series cameras , but there are several that all look really similar at relative prices .
i looked up reviews as well and it 's still hard to find a huge difference .
i 'm trying to pick up a nice point and shoot before i go on a vacation in june , and when i 'm presented with several options i have a hard time making a decision my self .
out of all the canonsd versions what are the major differences ?
i noticed in a thread comparing two of them that one had a wider angle lens .
i guess i 'm just curious what the smarter purchase is out of them .
not a huge enthusiast but better quality photos with less blur will definitely make me happy .
thanks !
edit : in addition it looks like the sd1200is is on sale for around 150 , and the example pictures from it look like it h as some pretty decent potential
