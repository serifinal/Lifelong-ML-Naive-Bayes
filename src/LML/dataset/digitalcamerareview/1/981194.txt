canon sd960is vs sd880is .
hi everyone ^ ^ , i have been lurking in these forums for quite sometime ^ ^ .
but now i have a question .
i want to get a canon p & s camera , and i am unsure on which one to get .
i looked at the digitalcamerareview 's for both the sd880 and sd960 , and they are pretty comprehensive .
but i want an opinion from someone who has test or used both camera 's please ^ ^ .
the reviews at amazon.com are also mixed on the sd960is as some like , while other abhor it due to over saturation of the colors .
