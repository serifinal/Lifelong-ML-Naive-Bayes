is this a good deal -lrb- eos-30d -rrb- ? .
hi , i 'm completely new to these forums and i did search a little before posting .
here is my question , here in canada i can get this : eos 30d body + case + canon ef-s 18-55mm lens + protama 58mm uv filter + 512mb cf card + card reader usb + extra batteries + 1 year canon warranty for a grand total of 929 $ with free shipping .
so basically , is this a good deal or normal price or a rip-off ?
i can get my hand on a eos 40d but i 'm not sure if the price difference -lrb- + 600 $ -rrb- is worth it .
thanks for any inputs .
