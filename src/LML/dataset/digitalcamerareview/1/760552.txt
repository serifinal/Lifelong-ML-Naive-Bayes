any news on 5d mk iii - typical odering time mk ii .
visiting back with a question after a long time ... i 'm on an eos 400d - and at some point will want to make a leap -lrb- direct leap bypassing the xxd series -rrb- - i hope for summer 2010 at the latest -lrb- maybe christmas , spring ?? -rrb- .
so , 2 questions : 1 -rrb- what is the typical time for a 5d mk ii to be delivered if orderd by a camera shop - i have seen comments that canon does not seem to produce them quick enough and they are backordered ?
-lrb- just a typical value -rrb- 2 -rrb- any news on a mk iii version of the 5d ?
the internet does n't seem to helpful in this respect at the moment .
-lrb- i 'd prefer it to a mk iii as it would have to last a long time - so a newer model would be better in this respect -rrb- thanks for any replies -lrb- and there is still plenty of time -rrb-
