sd780is vs sd940is .
newbie here so thanks in advance for help with my question .
i just picked up a sd780is for $ 179 , but noticed they just came out with the sd940is , the difference appears to be 4x optical zoom vs. 3x and a larger display 2.5 vs 2.7 inch , elimination of the viewfinder and a slightly different lens .
so the cheapest i can find the sd940is for is about $ 275 - do you all think it is worth the difference ?
i am looking for a high quality small point and shoot camera .
thanks in advance for your help !
