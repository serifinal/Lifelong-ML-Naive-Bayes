canon rebel series are the most reliable cameras !
-lrb- experience -rrb- .
when we retired all of our canon film cameras we bought our first rebel xt and it worked well with no complications .
when we returned to the dealership for our next camera we were pleased with the upgrades on the xti and that has worked well again .
we are anxiously awaiting the delivery of the xsi and the larger lcd .
last year we shot 300 weddings without a single glitch using the rebels .
here are some interesting videos about the new canon rebel xsi usability : http://www.infoborder.com/digital_ca...noneos450d.php
