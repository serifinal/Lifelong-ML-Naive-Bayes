sd 870 vs 850 .
hi , i read the other forums but did not quite have the answers i was looking for . .
so i wanted to ask . .
i 've did some research on both and the only differences mainly seem to be the wider lens and the optical viewfinder . .
this would be my first digital camera , but i have used others . .
is the optical viewfinder really necessary . . ?
i dont think i really used the viewfinder . .
but alot reviews seems to be disappointed by it . .
i do like the feature of it having wide lens . .
i know the 870 is newer . .
but would you consider it a better camera overall ?
my main use is for just photos of trips , friends , daily stuff .
thanks
