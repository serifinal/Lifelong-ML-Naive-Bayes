tips for canon s5 at the zoo on wednesday .
i 'm planning on picking up a canon s5 for a trip to the zoo tomorrow .
i 'm a total newbie in every way .
please offer any tips to help me take decent pics tomorrow .
here 's some information about tomorrow : purpose : take pics of animals for my bio class .
location : san diego zoo time : 2:30 -4:00 weather : mostly cloudy extra equipment : 2 gig sd card , 1 gig sd card , hiking stick -lrb- makeshift monopod ? -rrb-
, camera bag -lrb- maybe , if it fits in my laptop backpack -rrb- also , are they any must-have accessories like a lens hood or bean bag ?
unfortunately i do n't think i 'll have the time tomorrow to find a monopod i 'd be happy with , especially at the price i 'm willing to pay .
i 'm also limited as to what i can carry since i 'll be traveling on my motorcycle -lrb- suzuki sv650 -rrb- .
btw , i 'm hoping costco has it ... it 's $ 380 on their website with a 2 gig sd card .
let me know if i can do better locally .
