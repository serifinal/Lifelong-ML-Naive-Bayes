powershot g11 filter .
my daughter has a powershot g11 and we were thinking of getting her a protective cover for it , perhaps a filter or two .
it bothers my husband that the lens is so exposed .
-lrb- our daughter is n't the most conscientious , even with expensive items .
sigh . -rrb-
i was looking at an opteka on amazon -lrb- 3 for $ 25 -rrb- .
would this work as indicated or would i need extra equipment .
-lrb- i am not sure i would need to get an adapter tube , for instance . -rrb-
feedback anyone .
thanks
