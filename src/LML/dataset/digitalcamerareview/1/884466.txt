have a dying sd300 , looking at sd770 , sd850 come in ! .
im replacing my 3 yr old sd300 and it has been a trooper , i love its size and it has served me well .
im looking to replace it with a very similar sized unit and the sd770 is came up .
i want to add is , thats about all -lrb- and im sure they all take sharper , higher resolution than my old 4mp sd300 -rrb- .
i have an opportunity to trade in my sd300 for a sd850 is refurb through canon , but it seems a bit chunkier , but i am willing to live with it if it takes sharper photos than say a sd770 .
should i bother looking at the sd1100is ?
what other models retain the very thin thickness -lrb- ~ 20mm , .8 '' -rrb- or so that i am used to with my old sd300 ?
i mostly just aim and shoot on auto , no adjustments and would like to know of the existing canon elphs , which camera would be the best fit .
price is not all that important , so let me know which would give the easiest , non adjustment clearest pics .
thanks soo much in advance
