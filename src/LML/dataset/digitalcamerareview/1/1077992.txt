which canon should i get ?? .
so i 'm looking at buying an easy to use point and shoot camera for the family .
i 'm looking at the canon sd960is and the canon sd980is .
from what i understand the 980 is the same as the 960 execpt for a touch screen .
has anyone had experience with these cameras and which one do you think i should get ?
thanks in advance !
