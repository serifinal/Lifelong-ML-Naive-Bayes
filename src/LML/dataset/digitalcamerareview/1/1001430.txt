canon 234-70 2.8 l usm .
i am thinking about buying a 24-70 canon lens .
i have read a lot about this lens getting a bad copy .
my question is most say simply return the lens and canon will recalibrate it .
is this the same as using the micro focus adjustment in my camera -lrb- canon 5d mark ii -rrb- .
please reply to my home e-mail at rhanesworth10@yahoo.com
