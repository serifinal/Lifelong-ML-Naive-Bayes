should i cancel my order ? .
hi , after researching for the last several days , i finally decided to get the canon powershot a590 is .
i think it 's a good camera from what i 've been reading , but i 'm starting to wonder if i made a mistake .
i 'd really prefer an ultra compact , and newegg has a good price right now on the canon powershot sd1100 .
i 'm going on a trip overseas soon and i 'd really prefer something i can just fit in my pocket , but i will only be taking snapshots of my trip and friends .
i could really use some advice please .
what do you think ?
