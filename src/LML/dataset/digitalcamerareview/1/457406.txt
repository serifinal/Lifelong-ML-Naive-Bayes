powershot sd 700 is vs sd 800 is .
i have already purchased the 700 is and just now saw the 20 % off deal on the 800 is which makes the price difference a mere $ 50 .
from what i read the 800 is has the following upgrades : wideangle lens higher lcd resolution longer battery life faster processor is there anything else i 'm missing and if so does these upgrades warrant an extra $ 50 for the upgrade ?
i heard about the quality being worse than the sd 700 is but with this being my first ever camera purchase and not knowing anything about digital photos , would i notice the difference ?
