canon rebel xs .
hello , i have a canon rebel xs and i 'm currently looking into getting a tripod and eventually looking into buying a lens .
i wanted someone 's opinion on what would be the best .
lens - i do a lot of outdoor and a little indoor .
i read the lens buyers guide and was n't sure which one exactly i should lean towards more .
tripod - i read about a brand called velbon .
i seen on another forum that they had highly recommended it .
i would like other 's opinion on what they think that would be best .
