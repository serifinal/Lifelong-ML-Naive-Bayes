new s5 is memory question .
hi folks ; i 'm new to this camera and to the forums .
i want to buy a higher capacity sd card and was wondering if a sdhc card is used for movie shooting only or are they good for pictures as well ?
thanks .
taking the camera out tomorrow for my first serious outing .
ca n't wait , seems like an awesome unit .
