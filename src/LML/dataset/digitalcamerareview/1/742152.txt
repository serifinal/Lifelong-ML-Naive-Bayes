health & feeding canon sd950 is .
picked up a new canon sd950 is .
probably an overkill for my point-and-shoot needs , but it 's neat .
want to keep it protected .
bought a snug belt carrier - non-canon .
looking for the best screen protection i can get .
see that zagg has a body glove -lrb- or so it looks -rrb- , but i did n't see anything for sd950 specifically .
i 've used screen protectors for my pda phones , but rarely work well , especially for jelly -lrb- flex -rrb- screens .
what are your experiences with protecting this canon model .
what screen or full camera protectors would you suggest .
experiences appreciated .
thanks in advance .
