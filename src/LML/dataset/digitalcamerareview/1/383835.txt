canon powershot sd870 is vs. canon powershot sd750 .
i need some help deciding which digital camera to buy !
i 've narrowed my choices down to the canon 870 and canon 750 , but i do not know which one to pick .
i have never owned a canon before , but they seem to get great reviews .
i have found mostly all positive reviews for both the 870 and the 750 .
there is a big price difference between the two , which is why i am having a hard time choosing .
i take a lot of pictures , but i 'm by no means a professional .
i attend a lot of weddings , etc. , and take mostly indoor pictures .
i suppose my question is , which camera would you recommend overall , especially for indoor use ?
any help anyone can give me would be much appreciated !
