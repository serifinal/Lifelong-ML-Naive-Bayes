am i being fed a line ???? expert opinion please . .
hi , i have a samsung 50 '' plasma model a457 .
i purchased the set in august 2008 .
it has given me trouble free performance till of late .
the set picture gegraded some what , and the best way to describe it is hd became sd and sd was just terrible .
i suspected at first an external source like my sky hd box etc. .
however with all hdmi disconnected i noticed the noise .
on the menus there is lines across the set and horrible noise .
here is where i would appreciate some advice before i jump in with two feet .
although the visiting enginner told me the following , i informed him there had never been a aerail connected since bought in august 2008 .
he replied that has shot my theory down , however here is there report .
does it sound correct to you guys & gals ??? we returned the set to our workshop and tested on a full digital aerial system .
we found no fault apparent but noticed that when the aerial was removed the graphics on the screen showed distortion .
this is entirely normal as the set uses the aerial signal information to synchronise accurate graphics on the screen .
as we have found no fault our opinion is that the set is working according to manufactures specifications taking in to account the technology and age of set .
is it true for the set picture to work correctly without noise i must have an aerial connected ?
like i have said earlier i have never had an aerial connected since purchase 2008 .
please advise it would be very much appreciated .
i would welcome any advice please ?
