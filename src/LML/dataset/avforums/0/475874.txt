samsung c680 3d plasma - ` game mode ' calibrated settings please ? .
hi peeps , i am struggling to find a decent picture quality when using the ps3 in ` game mode ' ... i have to use it in this mode to play online else its awful !
does anyone have any decent or calibrated settings for use in game mode/standard .
i am concerned about hdmi level -lrb- normal or low -rrb- , cell light and brightness/contrast , sharpness , white balance and temp .
many thanks for any help
