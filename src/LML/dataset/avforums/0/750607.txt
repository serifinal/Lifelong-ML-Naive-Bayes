tesco deal for 2011 samsung active glasses .
for those who may have missed it in the ps59d6900 thread , tesco currently have a great deal in store on the accessory pack for 2011 samsung 3d tvs .
this gives you two pairs of ssg3100 glasses -lrb- normal price # 50 + each -rrb- plus a copy of megamind 3d on blu ray , all for # 39 !
list price for this pack is in excess of # 100 , and most places are doing it for # 60 -lrb- which is a deal anyway -rrb- , so this is an absolute bargain !
i 've just picked up a pack from tesco new malden and they had several more in stock .
others have reported the same deal in other branches , although some had to ask for them to check out back for stock .
