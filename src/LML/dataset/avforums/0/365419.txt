panasonic 3d glasses really bad for kids under 3yrs ? .
hi all , got a st30 and 2 pairs of 3d glasses and read the destructions that it 's not advisable that children under 6 use them .
wondering if anyone who has kids younger than the instruction recommendations and let them use them and what their experience was ?
i fully understand that this is their own experiences and ca n't be held in anyway liable etc etc. . .
just wondering if it 's really as bad as it makes out as one of the main reasons i thought of 3d was for kids films .
