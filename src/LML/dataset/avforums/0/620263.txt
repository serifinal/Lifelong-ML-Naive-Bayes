pioneer kuro panel life and problems .
hello users , i 'm very glad to be part of the community , since two days , i 'm a proud owner of a second hand pioneer kuro pdp-lx508d hdtv .
but yesterday i found some problems .
with no signal input -lrb- black screen -rrb- the panel is n't really black but grey -lrb- brightness and other relevant parameters are set on minimal settings -rrb- , it seems to be a idle luminance problem i think .
today i found out some informations about the panel in the service menu .
the panel life is around 9106 hrs and a power count of 2205 times .
not even 1/6 of panel lifetime is over .
where is the kuro `` blackerness '' i 've seen by every single pioneer dealer ?
for that price range is this for me unacceptable .
is there any solution for the idle luminance problem ?
could some one help me please ?
many thanks satadioz
