optical audio cable - how do these connect ? .
i am trying to connect the optical audio out from my plasma hdtv to the optical audio in on my av receiver .
i have never used optical cables before , , and the connections do n't seem to click or lock in to place .
i am concerned that i might push the connection too hard and break something .
the connection seems to fit in only one direction but does n't seem to go in far enough .
any help would be appreciated .
thanks
