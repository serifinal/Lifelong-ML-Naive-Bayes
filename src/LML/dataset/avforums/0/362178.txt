panasonic th-42ph9bs , how to connect ? .
hi , there is a guy selling th-42ph9bs just around the corner from me for 185 quid .
its a display .
i want to connect it to a sky hd box and dvd player .
without spending a load of money on an hdmi board for it -lrb- unless you can point me to a cheap one -rrb- how can i do this ?
what about sound wise ?
thanks for the help adam
