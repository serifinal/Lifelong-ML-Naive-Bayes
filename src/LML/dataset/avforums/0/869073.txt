anyone know the real deal re .
red sparkles ? .
hi there and a nearly merry christmas .
i 've started noticing what seems to be a known phenomenon : `` the red sparkles '' .
i have a samsung ps63p76hdx and i think it 's out of warranty so i 'd be really interested in anyone who 's overcome this issue without the need for major repair !
i 've read it 's happened on samsungs , lgs -lrb- mostly -rrb- , sonys , etc. , so it must be a ` generic ' problem .
i read it may be to do with voltages -lrb- though it seems that changing the voltage only masks the issue -rrb- or hdmi cables -lrb- though the problem has started without me changing my cable or it 's location -rrb- .
to add my version : i get smatterings of red pixels - some solid some flickering - in the dark areas of the picture -lrb- also sometimes in ` transition ' grey areas and not the black , like it is effecting a certain luminocity range -rrb- .
this condition can come immediately on switching on or sometimes after an hour or two .
it sometimes goes away after a few minutes and sometimes not .
if i change inputs away and back to hdmi it goes away , though sometimes only for a moment .
if i freeze the image , the red sparkles stay static , but will go away if i change inputs away and back .
fun huh ?!
here 's hoping someone can help me ... thanks !
