panasonic fault after only nine months . .
earlier this year my four year old tv failed and under the john lewis 5 year warranty was taken away for repair .
what happened next turned out to be rather an unpleasant experience and after lots of arguments with jl , they eventually agreed to replace with a new tv .
the replacement tv a panasonic plasma has now developed a fault which probably requires a new panel .
the prospect of the set being taken away by the same repair company fills me with horror and i 'm wondering if as the set is only 9 months old whether i should be entitled to a replacement rather than a repair ?
