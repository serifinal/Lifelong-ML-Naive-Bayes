will my movie marathon damage my plasma .
hi guys , i 'm still in the process of running in my new gt30 .
trying to be sensible , watching it a few hours every night , on cinema mode with contrast turned down and the picture zoomed in to avoid any static images .
current running time around 20 hours .
which brings me on to my question .
with my girlfriend away this weekend , i have an opportunity to watch all three lotr extended editions as has been my plan for a very long time .
i want to watch the movies in their original letterbox format and not zoomed in but i 'm worried that the 12 hours -lrb- pretty much -rrb- continuous viewing might result in image retention or screen burn .
any advice or opinion on this is welcomed .
am i right to be worried or am i being over cautious ?
cheers steven
