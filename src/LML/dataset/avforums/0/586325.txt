ps50c680 .
hey everyone , i have had my above set for about 4 months now .
everything was great as far as i was concerned until the screen cracked in the middle .
an engineer took it away and replaced the screen .
everything seemed good again , untill i started to notice ir on it .
i 'm with sky and although the ir does go after a while i dont find the amount of time it takes as acceptable .
i could be watching a film thats on a dark scene and i can still see the sky banner for anything from 5-10 minutes .
is this acceptable ?
since i have already had it replaced , would i be able to demand a refund or a replacement tv .
maybe the next model up ?
thanks graham
