samsung 50 '' insurance repair = no warranty ? .
hi all i got a samsung 50 '' plasma 3d -lrb- ps50c6900 -rrb- in january this year .
it was replaced once due to the 3d not working , then repaired a month later due to a screen distortion problem .
recently my son threw a toy at it and broke the glass .
my home insurance got a local company to fix it .
-lrb- replace the panel -rrb- a few weeks later i tested the 3d and it 's flickering between 2d and 3d .
really annoying .
also , i get the odd ` white noise ' vertical line on on some scenes thru sky and bluray .
i rang the repair company and they say the tv no longer has a warranty , and that only the panel has their 3 month warranty .
also , they say the 3d is a software fault and that i may be charged to fix it .
i have rang my insurance company to chase this up .
so , am i left with a faulty tv just over 3 months old ?
anybody have any experience with home insurance ?
thaks for any help .
val
