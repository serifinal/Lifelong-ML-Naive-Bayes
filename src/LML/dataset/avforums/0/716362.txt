upgrading to samsung ps51d6900 .
a few questions ... .
hi all .
hope you all had a great christmas !
this is my first post on these forums so i hope i 've put it in the right section !
i have ordered a samsung ps51d6900 from jl last night to upgrade from my 4 year old le52m87bdx .
this is my first plasma tv buy , and i bought it `` blind '' .
by that i mean i never saw it in the flesh before purchasing !
i relied heavilly on pictures and the strength of various reviews i found on the interweb .
so i have a few questions i hope can be answered to help me .
here goes ... 1 -rrb- is someone able to help with picture settings ?
i am a complete and utter novice on this stuff and am completely lost after the usual contrast , brightness etc , so i have no idea what the best settings are .
i play a fair bit of games and watch a decent amount of films so i need settings for each of these -lrb- if they 're different -rrb- .
i read to put it in `` pc '' mode to get the best refresh rate , but i thought you needed a pc lead to put it in pc mode ??? 2 -rrb- are there still issues with a fw update ?
i read on here that a recent update ruined the picture for some reason .
how can i find the fw version so i can choose to ignore the update if there are still problems and i find i 'm on an older one ?
-lrb- apologies if that makes no sense -rrb- .
3 -rrb- is image retention/burn in still an issue with plasma ?
i do n't want my gears of war hud showing up when i 'm watching top gear !
sorry for rambling on and i hope this makes sense .
thank you for any help/advice you can give .
