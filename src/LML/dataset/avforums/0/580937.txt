color problems in my panasonic pv60/px60 .
hi all , i have a weird color problem in my panasonic th-42pv -lrb- x -rrb- 60 plasma tv .
sometimes in dark scenes lilac/purple lines/shadows occur in the picture .
see the enclosed picture .
you can se the shadows in the phone .
they are not supposed to be there .
the problem if always in dark scenes .
i have tried all the settings - cinema , auto , normal and dynamic .
have also turned off all image enhancers .
the weird part is when i pause the image , the lilac/purple shadows dance and seems alive even when the pictures is frozen .
is it supposed to be this way ?
some scenes are really full of this shadows and are a pain in the ass to watch ... hope anyone can tell me what this is ?
please .
