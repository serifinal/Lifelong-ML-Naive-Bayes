samsung ps51d6900 .
just picked up my ps51d6900 from simply electricals today .
very good service from james in the retail shop .
i phoned up sunday enquiring about stock and he told me that 2 were due in on monday and he 'd phone me on monday morning to confirm .
i thought that he would n't phone me but he did and put one to one side for me to collect today .
so far really pleased with the set .
have only put it in movie mode to begin with but picture is a lot cleaner and has more natural colours than my faulty lg pk990 .
have not seen any ir which was bad on the lg and no line bleed or dirty screen effect which the lg suffered from .
blacks are very respectable but not stunning , maybe it will improve when i get round to calibrating it properly , but i 'm overall happy with black level , shadow details are very good .
no 3d glasses in box and shop not getting any until later in week so can not test that yet .
pvr function works a treat and the smart hub looks good although i have n't really looked into it yet .
no bbc iplayer on it yet though , i think that 's coming online very soon though .
just keeping my fingers crossed that there 's no blinking .
