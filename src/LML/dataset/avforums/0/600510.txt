redish tint on pioneer lx5090 - normal ? .
hello everyone , i 've been lurking these boards for months , but only registered today .
anyway , to my question .
i bought a pioneer lx5090 television about 5 months ago , and i have been very happy with this set .
however , after a month or two of use , i started noticing that the right hand side of the screen had a red-ish tint to it which is only visible when the screen shows a completely black image in a dimly lit -lrb- read : dark -rrb- room .
at first i thought maybe this was normal , but over time i started noticing it more and more - probably not because it got any worse , but because i knew it was there so i was constantly looking for it .
the visibility of this problem is hard to explain or show in images , but if i watch a movie in say a 2:35:1 -lrb- ie , with black borders -rrb- and the movie has some dark scenes , i can definitely notice this red tint , especially in the right hand lower corner .
the tint can only be seen in black , ie , if i give the set a completely white image , the image is white with no reddish tint , so with this in mind , i assume this issue is related to how the set creates blacks somehow .
anyway .
i have been in contact with pioneer support via e-mail , but they asked me to call them , which i did and was transferred to belgium -lrb- i think -rrb- .
i 'm trying to get a hold of a norwegian customer support person as my technical oral english leaves a lot to be desired , but in the mean time i thought i 'd ask for opinions here .
i 'm attaching some images i took to demonstrate the problem .
please notice that they are vastly overexposed , so it does not look nearly as bad as this to the naked eye , but still , they do show how uneven the black level really is .
