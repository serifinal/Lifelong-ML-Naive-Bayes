samsung ps43d450a2 .
hi i bought this at comet on christmas eve and it has worked perfectly until this morning .
there appears to be a shadow picture coming through of other channels , is this something to do with the graphite clip thing which it instructs you to clip on the power cord , this was n't present yesterday .
last night i tuned in the freeview channels and now i have this shadow screen which moves from left to right across the picture .
anyone help please ?
