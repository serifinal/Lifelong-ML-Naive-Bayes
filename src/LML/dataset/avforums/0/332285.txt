dead pixel - what should i do .
hi bought a new 51 '' samsung just last night and noticed it has 1 redish dead pixel 12 '' in from the side , noticed it as i was playing the run in disk on the white background !
just come off the phone from comet who said take it back they will replace it which is good , but is this the right thing to do or could the next one have more on ?
from normal viewing distance it is only visible on white or very light backgrounds , so in normal use you 'd probably not even know it was there , but now you do you look for it .
thoughts please ?
thought about using this http://udpix.free.fr/index.php?p=about , dont know if that works on plasma or is meant for lcd , but the thought of running that on the screen for a couple of hours with static laptop images on screen is frightening for screen burn .
