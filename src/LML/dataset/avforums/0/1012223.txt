samsung 51d6900 brightness pops fixed ? .
sorry i know i should search but i have looked through loads of threads and can not really find a definitive answer ... .
also i think a dedicated thread would be usefull as this is an otherwise excellent tv and this issue might put a lot of people -lrb- including me -rrb- off ... questions are as follows : a -rrb- has this been fixed now via firmware ?
or at least significantly reduced ?
b -rrb- how bad is this really ?
is it people being overly pedantic or is it a regular and distracting problem ?
how often does it happen ?
once a day ?
once every 5 minutes ?
it is hard to guage the severity of it ... c -rrb- does this model suffer from raising black levels after a few years ?
how bad is this ?
thanks a lot please reply because i am almost going to buy one i would just like a little clarification on these areas
