amazon returns panasonic g20 .
hello everybody .
has anyone on these forums had a problem getting a refund from amazon on faulty plasma tv 's .
i recently returned a panasonic 42g20 , the problem is they no longer have that model in stock , and that they would have to refund the money to the card i paid with .
the thing is when i bought the tv it was with a maestro card , but as of january this year the royal bank of scotland updated everyone 's accounts to a visa debit .
amazon can only pay my refund to my old card but when they go to process it , it will always be rejected by my bank .
i am incredibly frustrated as the other option of me getting a refund is by check , which takes 5 to 6 weeks to process .
how exactly do amazon think you can go without a tv for 6 weeks is just stupid .
