purchased the 46gt30 from jl ?
a couple of questions .
despite the negativity with green tinge fault i decided to take the risk with this set and purchased the panny 46gt30 tv + bluray + glasses + 5yr warranty .
could anyone answer the following questions , please : 1 -rrb- the bluray player apparently needs a special cable to render 3d , what is the lead ?
jl were trying to sell to me for # 40 , i am sure it is much cheaper elsewhere e.g. amazon/ebay .
2 -rrb- apparently the set comes with star wars triology , apparently this is only 2d , is there any offers direct with panasonic for 3d bluray -lrb- e.g. avatar -rrb- ?
3 -rrb- if i download a 3d demo , will it stream ok from laptop to tv - hdmi to hdmi ?
