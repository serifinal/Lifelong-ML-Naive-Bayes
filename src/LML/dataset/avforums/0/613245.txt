vt30 - your picture mode when using xbox 360/ps3 .
hi guys , as the title suggests , i was just wondering what picture mode you use and the settings within that mode -lrb- in depth calibrated settings not necessary , more everything else like brightness , sharpness , any of the options turned on/off in the advanced settings , things like that ! -rrb-
when using the xbox 360 or ps3 .
i have mine in game mode for obvious reasons but as i understand it , all the other modes are just as good providing you turn ifc off .
cheers .
