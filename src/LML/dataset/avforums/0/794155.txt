improvements in tv 's .
hi , i noticed that pc world had a few 50 '' plasma for pretty reasonable prices around the # 700 mark i brought my current tv about 4 or 5 years ago , its the samsung everyone was buying then and one of the first with 1080p24 , and it cost around the # 1800 mark i think .
wondering if the entry level models from the big buys -lrb- panasonic , samsung , etc -rrb- compare well against older pricer models ?
the models i noticed was samsung ps41d550 and panasonic txp50u30b
