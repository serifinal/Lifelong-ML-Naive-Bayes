panasonic viera tx-p42g20b - picture too large for screen .
hi .
i apologise if i have the wrong forum for this .
it looks like the best place to post this though !
i 've only noticed that the screen size is wrong whilst on sky when the channels have writing on .
have n't watched the television in any other way to scrutinize normal tv and dvds for the screen size too .
but seeing as i want to watch sky and not normal tv i need to sort it this way .
i 've tried pressing the aspect button but anything apart from auto -lrb- which it does n't fit on -rrb- makes the problem even worse .
what can i do to fix it ?
