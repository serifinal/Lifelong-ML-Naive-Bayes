how do i detune freeview and freesat on panny g20 .
does anyone know how to detune the digital channels ?
both freesat and freeview .
i do n't watch live broadcast tv anymore and would like to save myself the license fee -lrb- yeah i know they are a pain in the backside once you do that but i will deal with that when it comes -rrb- .
i do n't think it 's enough cutting the aerial cable at the wall as if you get any signal whatsoever they will nab you for it .
edit : nevermind .
i figured it out .
you have to auto tune with the aerial disconnected whereupon it will find no channels and you can leave it like that .
for analog i had to keep the aerial connected and make sure all the channels were de-tuned before disconnecting it .
