panasonic plasma help !! .
hi everyone , i turned my panasonic th-37px80b plasma on tonight and all i get is the green light flashing away , then it clicks like its going into standby but then starts flashing again .
i do n't get the red light light flashing at all like all the other problems i 've found when searching for the problem .
the screen starts working as you can noticably see it light up slightly but it stays black .
any ideas anybody ?
it 's almost 4 years old now so probably well out of warranty .
