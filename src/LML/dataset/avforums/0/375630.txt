image retention .
i have had my panasonic 37x10 for a couple of years now and am having problems with image retention from those flipping channels with static logos and qvc !
thankfully , it does disappear after a while but is annoying watching programmes whilst it is still showing !
is there anything i can do to resolve this ?
i have had a look at pixelprotector and wondered whether this is any good ?
it does seem to be a lot of hassle though ?
any advice would be ever so much appreciated .
