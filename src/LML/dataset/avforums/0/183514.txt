panasonic audio cables - problems .
hi all , i have a panasonic th_46pz81b plasma tv .
i have added a bose speaker system to it for better sound .
the audio lead is a jack plug to the bose and this goes to audio left and right at the back of the tv .
my problem is that when connected i can not control volume from tv remote , it has to be done from the bose pod which is connected by a lead .
i know i am lazy in saying i have to get up to alter the sound , but it is easier to use a remote .
a friend suggested using the optical digital audio connection on the tv , but i am afraid that lost me !!!
can anyone shine any light on this problem for me .
is there such a lead that goes from a jack plug to a optical digital audio point on the tv , and would this sort the problem .
the bose system is the companion 3 series ll .
many thanks for reading ...
