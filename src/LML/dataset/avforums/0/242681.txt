panasonic tx-p42gt30 - buzzing !
will mounting help ?! .
hi , so just had a tv engineer sent over to me by john lewis -lrb- hooray for 5 year guarantee -rrb- and he said that it 's supposed to make a buzzing noise like that , which sounds much like the noise you get from a lightbulb dimming switch , sort of like a white noise almost .
the problem is , when listening to the tv at about 20 % volume , i can still hear it , and same again in programmes/films where the vocals are quieter during a speaking only part of the film .
the tv is currently about 15-20cm away from the wall , on it 's stand , on a wooden set of drawers .
about 15-20cm above it is a wooden shelf with books on it , and there 's about 8-10cm gap either side of the tv , one of which has a wall next to it , the other has a wooden dvd tower next to it .
oh , and i sit about 8-10ft away and ca n't get back any further -lrb- curses to the small room ! -rrb-
mr. tv engineer said that wall mounting and using a bit of foam around the connecting parts will help dampen it since the sound wo n't be reflected off the wall and projected forwards .
is this bs ?
strangely enough , my tv has been on mute for the best part of an hour so that i can notice the buzzing difference between certain images , and at the moment it 's making next to no noise .
why ?!
i 've also got a ferrite core on the power lead towards the end nearest the tv - do these play any part in the buzz ?
sorry for the general ramble and questions , but if anyone 's got any input then this would be great , thanks !
