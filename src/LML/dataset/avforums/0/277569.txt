panasonic s30b - settings request .
hiya guys . .
i 'm brand new to plasma televisions and i was wondering if any of you had any settings for this tv that i could use .
http://www.avforums.com/review/panas...tv-review.html the above link is the tv i bought but the 50 '' inch version from john lewis .
http://www.johnlewis.com/231222456/product.aspx i 've just bought it and it 's brand new and sitting here .
i 'm a bit worried the default settings will cause image retention , or is that a non issue these days ?
could anyone post what settings they use and how can i calibrate the settings to a level better than the defaults .
also if anyone has any experience using it as a media centre -lrb- connected to a pc -rrb- is gaming mode the best way to reduce lag ?
thanks , james .
