panasonic plasma tc-p55st30 - motion seems to fast ? .
i just bought this tv and while watching blu ray and hd cable tv the people on the screen seem to be moving in fast forward .
it 's very unnatural and annoying .
everything looks great in 3d , but the 2d seem `` off '' .
is there anyway to fix this ?
