new panasonic p42gt30 - could it be a refurb ? .
hi , i have just purchased the panasonic viera p42gt30b .
box seemed ok but on unpacking have found the remote loose in the box not even in a bag or anything .
is this normal ?
i 'm worried it may be a refurb .
some of the other bits look like they have been thrown in with the instructions too whilst others are neatly shrink-wrapped .
should i worry about it ?
thanks for any advice .
