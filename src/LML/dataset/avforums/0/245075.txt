pioneer replace faulty power supplys .
just been investigating and found many links that mention that pioneer are aware of faulty power supply units in some of their plasma 's .
i found lots of u.s sites , so thought i would ring pioneer uk .
within 20 minutes i had received a call from authorised repairers near me who will visit and swap out unit , free of charge .
