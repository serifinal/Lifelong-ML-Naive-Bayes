upgrading to panasonic txp42vt20 . .
currently using a 37 inch pd60 thats 6 years old and has been used for 30k hours .
i 've never had a problem with it but i 'm thinking of moving this to the bedroom or sell it .
i can get a panasonic txp42vt20 for # 600 with five year warranty , is it a no brainer or should i give it a miss ?
