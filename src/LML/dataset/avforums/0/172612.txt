samsung d8000 - how do you get the full non freesat free to air channels ? .
hi .
i have now purchased the samsung 51 '' 8000 & was wondering how to get all the free to air channels on satellite ?
there is an auto tune function for all free channels but this does not tune in as many as my humax decoder .
the full list is here non &#45; subscription channels &#45; sky free to air &#45; over 200 free tv channels thanks for any help .
