panasonic st30 ps3 ghosting .
hi , have just bought a new panasonic smart viera tx-p46st30b , which is great for watching tv and films so far .
but im having problems with ghosting when i turned horizontally in skyrim on the ps3 , this was n't noticeable on my old samsung 46 '' lcd set .
ive read somewhere this is something to do with 30fps used in the game , but its come as a bit of a shock as all the reviews i read on the set mentioned how good the refresh rate is .
has anyone else experience this problem and have any work arounds ?
