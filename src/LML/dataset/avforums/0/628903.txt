stop child from changing picture & sound setti gs on 37px80 .
how can i stop my autistic son changing all the tv settings .
he is currently quite obsessed with it and no matter how often we change it back and tell him to stop , he continues to keep on doing it .
if there is a lock on the settings that would probably work .
any ideas ?
