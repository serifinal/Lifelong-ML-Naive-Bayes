lip sync issue on lg 50pk950 .
i 've just received a lg 50pk950 and have discovered lip sync problems .
i 'm using the tv 's own built-in speakers , and i have observed the problem with cable tv , both with the analog and digital tuner .
i have the same issue with cabled network playback trying with a wide variety of file types .
the audio is ~ 0,5 seconds early .
is there any menu option where i can delay the audio ?
if not , what can i do ?
