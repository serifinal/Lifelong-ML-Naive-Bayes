freesat hd .
hi guys i have sky linked thru my onkyo r608 and then from onkyo into my 50vt30 .
whenever i turn my tv on it says no channels found which does n't bother me because i just use sky thru hdmi .
however i would n't mind setting up freesat hd and freeview hd how do i go about setting it up .
what cables need to go where .
thanks
