panasonic s30 versus st30 .
is there any difference in the technology between these tv 's apart from the 3d ?
i 'm not interested in 3d whatsoever but i 'm wondering if the st30 is worth # 50 more than the s30 -lrb- amazon prices -rrb- .
comparing them side by side on the panasonic website they seem to be pretty much the same apart from the 3d aspect .
