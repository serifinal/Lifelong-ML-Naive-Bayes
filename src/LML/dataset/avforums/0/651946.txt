panasonic woes , i think i should make a complaint , any advice appreciated .
hi all , n00b here after some advice please bit of a saga this but i 'm considering calling panasonic customer service tomorrow as i 'm extremely disappointed with pana at the moment .
july 2009 i purchased a refurbed 42inch plasma viera , got it home and found out there was a fault with the tv not powering back up if you set it in stand by then turned the main switch off , retailer sent engineer , took it away changed software sent it back same day , this time with no sound .
i was n't impressed and retailer soured a replacement direct from pana and gave me 3yr warranty for free -lrb- phew ! -rrb-
3 june 2011 the 42 inch viera failed , 10 blinks , warranty wrote it off completely after 3 weeks .
i added some money to the insurance credit and retailer sourced me a viera txp50g20 direct from pana last monday , it was delivered thursday , i watched a couple of movies screens amazing !
, next night bit of tv then 45 mins of gran turismo , tv made a kinda pop/crack noise shut down -lrb- smell of melting wires -rrb- 7 blinks
