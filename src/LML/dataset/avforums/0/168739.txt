so what happened about vt30s + fbr ? .
hi i have a vt30 65inch and was following the whole fbr issue day by day on here up until a few months ago .
then the tv had to be covered in plastic sheeting because we were having some building work done in the house .
i unwrapped it after about two months the other day and updated the fw .
i can still be fbr especially on dragons den reruns .
could somebody just quickly update me as to where we are with this issue ?
thanks
