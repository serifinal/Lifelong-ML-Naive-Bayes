gt30 sat tuner versus sky hd - is it better quality ? .
hi everybody , first post from a newbie .
i got a p46 gt30b late september , and i have run it in , set up the picture using hd basics twice , fitted back lighting , etc. .
it does not suffer from the `` green blob '' .
i finally got sky hd setup at the weekend and was surprised by it 's picture quality when i compared it to the internal hd tuner on the four hd channels that are common , both live , and recorded .
i find that the internal tuner produces a `` better '' picture , for example a much wider range of colours on face if you compare the same footage , making it more life like .
another interesting thing is that the 50hz stutter may be less , but still do n't have a proper view .
i 've only been comparing over 2 days , so it 's early days , but has anyone else got thoughts , research or views on the subject ?
apologies to the mods if i should have posted in the another part of the forum .
