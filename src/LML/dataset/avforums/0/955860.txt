panasonic txp50-g20b network issues .
hello to you all !!
i am new to this and hopefully my question can be answered !!
i recently purchased the txp50-g20b and was looking to get it connected to my sky router using an ethernet cable .
i have entered the ip address , gateway etc correctly -lrb- confirmed by sky -rrb- although they told me there is no port number so i left this within the proxy settings blank .
when i perform the connection test , i get the successful message .
the issue is when i select the media server option within the input selection list , it comes back with an error message saying `` server not found '' .
the only thing i may not have done is entered values in the access point settings within the network setup screen .
this is because it is currently greyed out and simply shows '' -- '' .
having had a look at the manual it says press wps button on access point -lrb- which i am assuming is my router -rrb- but there is no such button .
my main aim is to watch movies on my lovefilm account -lrb- assuming it is available -rrb- however would like the network setup ... 1 .
how do i get the network setup ?
2 .
once setup will i be able to stream movies via lovefilm ?
many thanks in advance
