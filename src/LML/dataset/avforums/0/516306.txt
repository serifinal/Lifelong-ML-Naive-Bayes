ps51d6900 + 1920x1080@60hz in `` dvi pc '' mode = blue overlay .
i 've posted this within the ps51d6900 and ps59d6900 threads already but i thought it may get lost in those threads .
i 've now tested this on 3 different sets with identical results each time with samsung spouting the same `` get a replacement from your retailer '' reply .
it obviously needs a fix via a firmware update , i 've seen the same fault with both v1007 and the most current 1009 updates .
if you connect a pc -lrb- outputting 1920x1080@60hz -rrb- to hdmi1/dvi and label it as either `` dvi pc '' or `` pc '' , the tv will intermittently apply a blue overlay to the display .
i 've tried it with a ps3 also just to check it 's not the 3 different pcs that i 've used , and the ps3 was the same .
it never does it if the input is labelled as something else -lrb- bluray , satellite etc -rrb- , but then that does n't enable `` pc mode '' with smooth text and no over scan etc. .
to reproduce : attach a pc via hdmi 1/dvi label the source as pc or dvi pc select a source on hdmi 2 , 3 or 4 turn off tv turn tv on -lrb- tv should be on the hdmi source you selected before powering off -rrb- switch to hdmi1/dvi -lrb- a blue tint should now be covering the entire screen -rrb- cycle the power again to get rid of it
