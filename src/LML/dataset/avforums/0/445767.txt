pioneer pdp434 - anyone have parts to lend ? .
hey guys , my last post was a bunk no one had any answers about the tv - pioneer 434 .
however my last stand will be to try and borrow / invest to see whats wrong with the tv .
i am interested in the x/y assembly and power supply , if anyone has either of these components let me know .
i 'm east coast usa by the way .
sorry for questions on such an old tv , but i do n't want to dump it yet .
thanks , tom p.s. - i 've figured out the media box works using the it through a computer and getting readings .
the monitor shows no picture however , but there are no burn signs etc inside the tv .
