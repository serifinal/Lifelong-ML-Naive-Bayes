panasonic 42vt20b brightness and other possible issues ? .
hi all , just picked up an ex demo 42vt20b , having a couple of possible issues and wondered if anyone can help or have any opinions .
firstly , when the picture setting is set to `` normal '' it seems quite dim and lacking brightness , especially with `` cats '' switched off , the only way i can get an acceptable picture is to have it on dynamic or turn the contrast up .
also thx , cinema etc are brighter .
another thing i have noticed is there is a lot of `` plasma dot noise '' when looking at the menus when on `` standard '' setting , this is sometimes noticeable in dark scenes , however its almost eliminated when using other picture modes -lrb- maybe someone can look at this on their 's to see if this also happens if not too much hassle -rrb- i have checked the panel hours and it 's `` 330 '' hours and 51 power cycles , so it 's probably been on display + / - a month .
also i have owned a few plasma 's previously , my last tv was a px70 so am familiar with the brightness differences with plasma compared to other forms of tv display technologies .
thanks
