st30 feels ` stuttery ' while gaming .
hi , i purchased a 42 '' st30 set a few weeks ago for my new house which i moved into yesterday .
obviously first thing i done was setup the tv , sky and xbox to see how it performed as it was a big leap from my old 720p plasma back in the day .
i had a lg plasma -lrb- cant remember the model -rrb- but it was only about # 400 quid about 4 years ago so it was n't a amazing set .
i have n't calibrated or broke in the tv yet , although changed a few settings from the defaults to make it a bit better .
the hd content seems amazing even at 720p from sky hd -lrb- put on avatar and it looked great , although it looked a bit skippy -lrb- looked like it was on a 50hz tv or something -rrb- when the camera was panning from left to right .
is that normal ?
or is it because of the sky feed ? -rrb-
my major problem with it is games .
i put on bf3 to have a look at the improvement and i was quite disappointed with it overall .
although the picture was great , whilst turning around in circles , the motion was very very stuttery when turning a bit fast .
it looked like it did n't handle turning very well at all and it started to hurt my eyes after a while .
i have been playing around with some of the settings -lrb- although i cant get into the advanced settings for some reason , the custom picture mode was n't there ? -rrb-
and nothing seems to make it better or worse .
even changing the picture modes from game to normal or dynamic did n't really affect it .
i am a bit of a av noob so any help sorting this out will be very much appreciated .
i will be calibrating the tv after it has been broken in , but looking at the settings i cant see any of the settings that d-nice describes ?
are they not available on uk sets ?
thanks
