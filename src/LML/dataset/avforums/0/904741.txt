panasonic plasma brightness fluctuation .
hello , i have looked through other threads and noticed a lot of comments about brightness fluctuation on panasonic 2011 plasmas .
i would like to get a 42g30 but this is putting me off a bit ... .
i was jsut wondering how often does this happen and how noticable is it on this model ?
is it like once every minute ?
or multiple times a minute ?
or like once every 10 minutes ?
once an hour ?
etc ?
i havnt noticed the problem in the shop and i am not sure what the actual severity / how noticable it really is ... could someone please clear this up for me because it would be much appreciated as it is currently the only thing stopping me buying one ...
