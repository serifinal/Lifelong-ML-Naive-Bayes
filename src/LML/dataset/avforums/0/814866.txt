has the green tinge issue put you off buying panasonic ? .
ok looks like this thread and poll may be needed on here .
please keep this a one issue thread only .
i want panasonic and others to have some idea what damage this sort of thing can do to sales .
to be clear if you vote yes it does n't necessarily mean you will never buy panasonic again , more wont buy now or in the near future .
