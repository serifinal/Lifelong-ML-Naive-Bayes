panasonic p50g1b motion bluring .
hi have been having problems with my panny getting loads of juddering and motion bluring .
bought tv from richer sounds with 5 year plan .
the tv went for repair and they replaced a hdmi pcb .
this has made some improvement but i am still getting some bluring .
is this a common problem with panny sets ?
its sill doing it on sky , xbox , panny dvd , have not tryed blu-ray yet as it seems to only do it went frames that pan sideways .
the guy who came out to look at tv said lots of motion juddering , ghosting effect .
