vt30 ifc and 24p smooth - some observations .
the ifc on my vt30 is ropey at best , those that have seen it can testify that it 's disadvantages normally outweigh the advantages .
ifc to my eyes differs in no way at all to 24p smooth film - can anyone clarify if there is some difference in the technology being used to ` fill in the frame rate ' ?
however , my friend has a panasonic pt-ae2000 -lrb- projector @ circa # 2000 when it was released -rrb- , which is a couple of years old now .
it has ifc , and when set to max it seems to operate flawlessly , not artefacting whatsoever .
this is from a unit that was released in 2008 .
what i do n't understand is how it can be so good on a unit that was released three years before the vt30 , yet the processor in the vt30 simply does n't seem to be able to cope with fast pans with ifc turned on .
although many will disagree , when ifc works flawlessly it is stunning , and the larger our screens get the more necessary i believe it will be .
interestingly , and i do n't know if anyone can explain this , but with ifc turned up to max when viewing 3d material , i ca n't spot any flaws at all .
perfectly smooth picture with no artefacting .
i 'd be interested to hear others views on this feature .
i appreciate there are purists who hate this function , but i know there are others who can see it 's merits .
