3d tv are you still watching .
before i bought my 3d tv i was all excited , i watched 3d movies on the sky 3d channel , i downloaded the bit of 3d we all got excited the first time we watched a christmas carol in 3d , avatar 3d was quite good , but if i 'm honest i think it was just a bit of a gimmick , i cant be bothered to put the glasses on these days , i would rather just watch a good movie that is nice and bright without all the hassle of the glasses , does anyone else feel like this , or are you still enjoying your 3d tv .
