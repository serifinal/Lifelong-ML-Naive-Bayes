viera cast questions .
despite searching for the answers i ca n't find them , so here goes i have a 2010 g20 with viera cast i am trying to find out 1 - is it possible to resize the standard video playback window - i saw a youtube demo where the initial playback window magically went to full screen but they did not show you how !
2 .
how do you ff/rew the video whilst in playback - i have tried the buttons that look like >> and << at the bottom of the window - all it does is ff/rew to the next or prev video in the search list - i just want to ff/rew the individual video i am watching advice appreciated
