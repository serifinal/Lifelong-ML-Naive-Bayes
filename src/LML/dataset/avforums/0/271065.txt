panasonic tx-pxxs10 owner 's thread .
hi all , i need more help , i was originally all set for the purchase of a g10 , but these things are almost impossible to find at a good price in stock at the moment , after reading a review of both the g10 and the s10 on what hifi 's website i am now in even more of a muddle , they suggest there is nearly no difference between the models , so , not so much for the # 30 price difference , mostly stock differences do i bite the bullet and go for the s10 .
at the end of the day i am interested in one thing , i currently have an old 28 '' phillips tube set , if i have a picture quality as good as or better , i will be a happy man , obviously if it is worse ... then well ... what a waste of a lot of money .
cheers , rob .
