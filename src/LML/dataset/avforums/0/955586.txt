few questions on breaking in a panasonic g30 . .
i originally thought that you only broke in a new plasma for the first 150 hours or so was to stop ir - and depending on what post you read - ir isnt much of an issue these days anyway .
however my first month of having this tv has brought it 's fair share of headaches such as phosphor flashes on high contrast images , rainbow style ghosting and something else i ' v noticed when i look up close is a fair bit of noise .
firstly , is this noise due to the fact that the phosphors havent matured -lrb- apologies if this is the wrong word -rrb- yet ?
could the lively phosphors be the result of the flashing im getting ?
iv never had this problem with crt 's before - which i believe also use phosphor 's - and the problem seems too prominent to simply say only a small number of people are affected as you can clearly see it on a youtube video which plays sin city .
so at the moment im using some slides to break it in .
unsure if this is now a pointless task to be honest but if anyone could answer the following it would be much appreciated : 1 -rrb- i ' v used the tv on average for 7 hours a day for 23 days .
due to prominent phosphor flashes im now using slides to break it in - is this now pointless ?
2 -rrb- i can see lots of noise when i look closely at the screen .
is this a sign of a defective tv ?
3 -rrb- due to the fact i 'm now uniformly ageing the phosphors , will the prominent flashes im experiencing now disappear more quickly ?
