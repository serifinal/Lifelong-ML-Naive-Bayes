panasonic p50v10 screen burn or image retention ?
-lrb- .
hi guys , had my plasma for a couple of years now but it is increasingly having issues with image retention i watch a lot of sky sports news hd and the white box at the bottom of the page is staying/burning onto the screen .
it is really visible against dark and especially light uniform colours .
it began to happen ages ago but would clear , now it is always there , even though i now watch sky sports news much less .
is there anything i can do or is it too late ?
thanks for any help .
pete
