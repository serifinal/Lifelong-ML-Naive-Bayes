3d + panasonic plasma .
hello all , firstly i have posted this in 3d tv technology and plasma tv 's section as i 'm not sure what section would be best ?
if this is wrong , please delete this thread .
just recently bought a new tv -lrb- panasonic tx-p42st30 -rrb- and got a couple of pairs of 3d glasses on friday .
i never tried out 3d and watch my first 3d movie last night and i must say it was very good !
although i 'm a little concerned , when i took off the glasses i noticed the movie was very very bright and i 'm wondering would this be a problem on a plasma screen -lrb- image retention / burn-in -rrb- since i 've noticed from reading around to avoid high brightness / contrast on plasma 's .
so would watching 3d movies cause a problem since they are very very bright , if you look without the glasses on .
many thanks !
