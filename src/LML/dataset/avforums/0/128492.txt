samsung ps51d550 faults ? .
hey all , just bought a samsung ps51d550 51 '' plasma from currys on sunday .
after living with it for a few days there are a few annoying things i 've noticed .
1 -rrb- a fairly loud buzzing noise coming from the back .
the brighter the screen the louder the buzz gets .
2 -rrb- some pretty awfull flickering at 60hz , ok at 50hz .
again , the brighter the image , the worse the flickering .
this is particularly bad when playing the wii as it can not be changed to 50hz progressive through component .
this stings my eyes after a while .
3 -rrb- ghosting of scrolling text .
for example , black credits scrolling on a white background creates a ghosting in the white ; like some crt 's used to .
4 -rrb- what i can only describe as bad power regulation .
say for example i have my pc on -lrb- through hdmi/dvi -rrb- with a white backgroung .
if i open a smaller black window , the rest of the image gets brighter .
kinda like the black portion of the image is allowing more power to the rest of the image -lrb- best i can describe -rrb- .
this happens on all sources , but is most easily demonstrated with the pc .
apart from that it 's great !
x0 .
i bought this as an upgrade from a 1yr old 3d 40 '' samsung lcd and find myself wanting to switch back .
any thoughts ?
cheers .
craig .
