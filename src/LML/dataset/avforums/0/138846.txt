new panny hates my hummy . .
hi guys .
just got a new panny plasma with built in freeview .
i ran the rf cable thru ' my humax box to the tv and the tv does n't pick up a signal .
i works fine without the humax box but as soon as i loop thru ' i lose the signal .
any idea 's ?
am i missing something so obvious i ca n't see it ?
seem 's very strange to me .
