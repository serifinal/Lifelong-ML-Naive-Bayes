is this right ? .
after a recent accident , my daughters lg 50ps3000 plasma tv was returned from her insurance company with a letter saying she did not have a claim ?
her husband tried to move the tv without help , slipped and dropped it .
they say that the tv had a pre exsisting fault , apparently the zsus circuit board had a fault ?
if this fault had exsisted it would have been repaired because the tv is only just over a year old and was a wedding present plus showed no sign of this fault prior to the accident !
could this fault have occurd as a result of the accident ??? do you think as i , that this is a get out by the insurance company ??? many thanks , x5les
