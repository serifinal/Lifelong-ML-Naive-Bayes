help !
has the storms killed my panny ? .
hi , i bought a panasonic tx-p42g10 from digital direct in 2009 .
was watching tv till the wee hours last night -lrb- friday -rrb- .
saturday we had a terrific thunderstorm and a power cut .
just went to watch some tv - the unit switches on fine , can see all the menus no problem , but can not get a picture from my sky hd box , ps3 or blu-ray player .
-lrb- the latter two are through an amp .
i pulled everything apart , unplugged the tv for an hour or so , then connected just the sky hd box and the ps3 via hdmi straight into the tv bypassing the amp .
no joy !
has the storm fried my telly ?
how do i go about getting it fixed ?
thanks
