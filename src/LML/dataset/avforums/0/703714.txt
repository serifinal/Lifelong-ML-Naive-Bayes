ps51d6900 no picture at all ? .
hi , just got above tv , had it for 10 days and i turned it on today and there is no picture what so ever , power light is working , it seems to be accepting ir commands but there is no output what soever via the screen or sound .
not even a boot screen , or smart tv .
is this a case of dead unit for replacement ?
or is there any further test i could do ?
if it is dead , does anyone know what i can expect in terms of getting a replacement and how quickly ?
i will be obviously calling robert whyte tomorrow to start this process , but being this near to holidays , what are my chances to get it replaced before next week ?
many thanks
