panasonic gt30 recording question . . .
first of all for some reason i cant post in the official thread keeps saying `` i dont have the rights to edit thread . .
: / '' i own a gt30 46 '' panasonic tv .
however i have a question about recording using the usb feature .
after a little research ive foun out you cant record to a usb pen drive so ive been doing a little window shopping for a hard drive enclosure .
before i pay out the money , can any one confirm you can record off of an hdmi source like the ps3 ?
i wish to record some gameplay footage from the ps3 with the aim then being to transfer the video over to the pc for uploading to youtube .
however i get the feeling there may be a block on doing this -lrb- as some could record blu ray/dvd movies through this feature -rrb- and will only allow recording from an aerial .
is it possible ??
