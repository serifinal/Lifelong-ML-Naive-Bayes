samsung plasma tv - black levels/dynamic contrast - help ! .
hi , im hoping someone can help me .
i have the samsung c680 3d plasma tv ... 1 .
how do i test if my black levels are correct ?
i normally have my brightness at about 50 % - anything less and i appear to loose detail in dark areas -lrb- although 50 isnt great ... anything above 60-65 % and it appears to go slightly whitish ... how can i make the screen vibrant like an led with colour yet give good deep black levels as a plasma should ?
2 .
why is the hdmi black level sometimes greyed out in the menu options ?
it seems to be that when i watch anything through my bluray 3d player -lrb- samsung bd5900 and my hddvd player hdep30 -rrb- for some reason it 's greyed out when watching blu-ray / dvds , and it 's always at normal when grayed out .
does this have anything to do with my setup ?!
3 .
dynamic contrast : yes or no ?
okay so is dynamic contrast worth using on either low medium or high ?!
i have heard dc can cause an awkward `` dip '' during `` fade to black '' moments in movies . .
or it can hinder the picture and make it add `` noise '' and bad `` artifacts '' ... .
is this true ?
also , black level setting -lrb- dark , darker , darkest -rrb- i assume this will crush any black or shadow detail and make it non apparent ?
4 .
gamma whilst i am still learning what gamma is -lrb- the control between saturation of colour , brightness and contrast and where they meet -rrb- ... if gamma is above or below is it better to be higher than lower ?
thankyou kindly .
