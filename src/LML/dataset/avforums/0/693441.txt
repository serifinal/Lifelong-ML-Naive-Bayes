panasonic vt30 - calibration & settings thread .
i thought it would be a good idea to start a thread dedicated to sharing and discussing the settings of the panasonic vt30 .
i will also try to post the settings of some of the top review sites when they come up with them .
i think it is nice to share all of the settings around the web and the ones we come up with our selves .
however it is important to keep in mind that settings , especially thosefor white balance and color management , are very specific for each individual set and probably for plasma even more so than for lcd/led .
i am still kind of new to this calibration thing , so if the experts on this forum want something added in this opening post please let me know and i will add it .
