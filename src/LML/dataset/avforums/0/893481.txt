no sound on component channel .
hi , i have just bought a pioneer pdp 507xd tv and am trying to hook up my xbox 360 via the component channel .
i have managed to get the picture , but there is no sound even though i have plugged in the red and white connecters from the 360 into the sound section on the back of the tv .
any ideas please ???
