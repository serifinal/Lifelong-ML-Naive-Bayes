from my knowledge ... 1 -rcb- downgrade your tv with a old firmware -lrb- so only than you can access the service menu -rrb- 2 -rcb- after downgrade , follow the links to activate avi playback from other forums online , there is few method a -rcb- hold ok on both tv panel and remote control together for 10 sec b -rcb- or / hold menu button on both tv panel and remote together for 10 sec 3 -rcb- then you be untill then .
i hope someone has solve this issue ... .
