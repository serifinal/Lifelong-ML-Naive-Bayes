panasonic pro panel : pf30 .
any chance of you testing the pro plasma pf30 ?
i 'd really like to know how well it might compare to the vt30 ?
not everyone needs a tuner built in to create a home cinema system .
i wonder if there will be any processing to curb the 50hz issues though .
the viera range have ifc/mid but what of their pro range ?
the 50 '' pf30 is similar money to the vt30 : would the vt30 wipe the floor with its pro panel cousin ?
