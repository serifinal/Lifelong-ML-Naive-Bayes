plasma 's and gaming .
if you are cautious with your gaming and dont play for more than a few hours is there any risk factor with the latest plasma 's ? .
trying to broaden my choices and gaming is major factor but input lag seems to be a major crutch for this years higher rated mid level 3dtv 's .
starting to consider plasma in their stead .
thanks
