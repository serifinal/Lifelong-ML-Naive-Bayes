panasonic vt30b screen burn .
i purchased this tv in june and have just realised tonight when viewing an advert with a white background that the sky sports 4 exclusive logo is in the top right corner of the tv , is this image retention or screen burn ?
it is not noticeable when there are dark colours over it but i am still worried about this .
i have 5 year warranty with panasonic , i bought the tv of amazon of a retailer , can i somehow get a refund or exchange it ?
