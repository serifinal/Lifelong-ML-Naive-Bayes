getting rid of plasma screen burn .
well , i 've noticed a nice cn burned into the bottom right of my plasma from the cartoon network channel !
tne children have n't watched the channel for 24hrs now , and still the cn is there .
i can see it for example on light colour backgrounds .
eg : the sky interface .
is there anyway i can get rid of it ?
very annoyed it 's there
