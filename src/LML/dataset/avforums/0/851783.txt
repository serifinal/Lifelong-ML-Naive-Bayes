pv500 fault/problem thread .
first of all if you aint got a pv500 then dont post here ... .
spoken with panasonic engineer regarding the contrast change , although i cant see it on my screen now , no matter what i watch .
panny have also emailed me ... .
i would also stress that there is not an inherent defect with this model and there is therefore no reason why the problem that you are experiencing can not be remedied by a qualified engineer .
i would recommend that you refer back to your retailer , who will be able to organise an inspection .
otherwise i can arange for a panasonic field engineer to inspect your screen within the next 4 working business days .
only problem is cant see the contrast change anymore , i have put the set into cinema mode , contrast and brightness set 25 % and put colour managment on .
hey presto its not doing it .
also when i tun the set on i get several flashes from the red led maybee 4-5 is this normal ???
