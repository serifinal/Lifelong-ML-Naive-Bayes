samsung c7000 .
hi all , my samsung c7000 tv 's screen stopped coming on .
i called samsung and a repair centre called me and collected the tv they stated that the mother board was gone and required replacing !
this was on the 12th october !
no news of tv being fixed when i called early november was really peed off when the repair centre stated that mother board was out of stock .
i called samsung and after a number of calls stated they will replace my at tv for a d6900 which cost about # 800 bought my c7000 when it was released for # 1250 and even provided them with an invoice .
they told me i had no other choice but to take that model tv !
by then i was over a month without tv and read the spec for d6900 and was happy . .
but it now the 23rd and i still have no tv !
samsung keep saying its with the delivery company concord never heard of them and all the numbers provided my google either do n't work or is being used by a residential place and samsung state `` we connor provide you with concordia number to track your tv '' i am so fed with samsung do you guys think i can get a refund on my tv because to be honest i do n't want to own anything made by samsung ever again !!
sorry for the long post
