samsung plasma tv owners -- forget game mode !
use pc mode ! .
hi , i have just come across a little hidden setting that has shocked me !
for any of you with a big screen plasma 50 '' above , you may find that response time is abit laggy , especially for gamers -lrb- ps3/360 -rrb- so we all know about the game mode on most of our tv 's which up the response time etc. . .
but i have just stumbled across a hidden feature on my samsung 2010 plasma tv basically start up your tv and ps3/360 ... go to source list . .
click edit name . .
go down to your input -lrb- in my case my ps3 is connected to hdmi1/dvi -rrb- ... click the arrow across ... select pc from the list ... the tv wil blink on/off afew seconds then come back ... you will have all 3 setting modes to choose from -lrb- movie mode , standard mode , dynamic mode -rrb- all be it they will be limited but you can still adjust cell light , contrast , brightness , eco solution , color temp , gamma , dynamic contrast , white balance , screen size and hdmi black level ... oh and screen burn protection ... now for the fun bit !
i just tried mw3 in movie mode , then game mode then pc mode !
and its a huge difference for me . .
its basically like playing on a monitor i hope this helps out some people , this may well be old news and i could be late to the party but hey as long as some get the benefit from this post
