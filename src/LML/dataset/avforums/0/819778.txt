pdp 436 no display .
hi , i have a pioneer pdp 436 display .
when disconnected from the media reciever i would expect a red and blue flashing square on the screen but i get nothing but the red and blue led 's flashing near the switch .
i am recieving the new media reciever later , but wanted to start looking at the faults now .
i did buy this as faulty just so you know .
any guidance would be appreciated .
