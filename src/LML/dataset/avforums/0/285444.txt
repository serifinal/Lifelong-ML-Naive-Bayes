vx100 frame interpolation .
supposing to use vx100 with radiance xs , i put my vx100 in external scaler mode .
reading the new vx300 review there is a part where the reviewer said that you have to turn off the frame interpolation to get the best result .
i ca n't find this setting in my vx100 menu .
if i go to signal menu i see what i attach .
can someone help me ?
thanks
