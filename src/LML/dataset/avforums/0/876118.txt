panasonic closes its uk television design centre !!
<shock> .
shock closure of panasonic tv centre in cardiff its sad to see so many people losing their jobs .
i was under the impression that the key tv design stuff was all done in osaka but apparently not .
i wonder why we end up with glaring design errors since 2009 in panasonic tv product e.g. rising black levels , 50hz errors , floating blacks etc etc is this down to the uk team or the osaka design teams making mistakes ?
uk customers already have a `` firewall '' in panasonic uk for not getting feedback directly to their design teams .
and apparently my flagship panasonic tv of 2009/2010 , the z1 is not fixable !
will things get better by bringing r&d back to japan ?
