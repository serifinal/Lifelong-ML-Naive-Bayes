pioneer pdp 507xd hdmi not working .
hi , i have the pioneer 507xd .
i play my pc blu-ray player through the hdmi port .
all of a sudden the hdmi would no longer show a picture .
i have tried inputs 3 and 4 .
and i have also tried other equipment such as my sonyhd camcorder directly , including a different hdmi cable .
input 3 is enabled in the settings menu too .
my nvidia control panel detects my tv so a connection is happening -lrb- i think -rrb- just no picture .
it is now 3yrs old .
and have only started using the hdmi ports recently .
does anybody have any ideas ?
pioneer want # 160 exvat just for a call out .
minus labour and parts !!
i really appreciate your help .
