has panasonic 's update worked on your set ? .
ok guys to help panasonic fix our sets can all those who have had the software update please vote on the poll and post your model number i.e. 46 `` gt30 .
then post your findings .
example .
mode : 46 '' gt30 i had the software installed on my set whilst having a replacement panel fitted .
the green splats have changed due to the new panel and the intensity of the effected areas seem the same , maybe worse , but this could be due to the new panel being more effected by the issue .
end result of the update on my set is n't satisfactory , with some viewing i can still see the green tinge on parts of the screen .
this is just as an example , please add anything you feel may be relevant and any specific questions you would like to ask panasonic in relation to your set .
this thread is not for chat please use the green tinge thread for that .
this thread is for information gathering only .
please only post if you have had the software update installed on your set .
this is the specific update to deal with these green blobs , this is not a general release firmware .
