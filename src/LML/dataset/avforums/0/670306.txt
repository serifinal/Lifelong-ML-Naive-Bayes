panny 50 '' with only vga sockets ... .
can i use an xga box -lrb- gadmei -rrb- to watch freeview box on my panny 50 '' plasma ?
it only has 2 vga sockets -lrb- female -rrb- so makes a great monitor but i want to watch tv on it lol .
got it from work as it had slight ir but a great set .
tried # 3 scart to vga cable but no joy so searched the forum and an xga box was suggested to someone but he never said how he got on with it .
cheers !
