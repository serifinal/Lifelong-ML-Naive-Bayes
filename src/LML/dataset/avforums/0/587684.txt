gaming on the panny vt30 .
guys , most of the vt30 reviews i 've read state that input lag on this tv is just as fast in any picture mode -lrb- providing ifc is turned off -rrb- as it is game mode .
therefore , given that game modes apparently affect how good a game looks due to the removal of all the video processing , now that it seems using game mode is n't a necessity , do you still use game mode when gaming or do you have another picture preference and if so which one and why ?!
