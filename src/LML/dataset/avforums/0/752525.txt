help !
kuro pdp-lx5080 red blinking lights ! .
two days before christmas half way through motd and the screen makes a funny chirp noise , turns off and i &#8217; m left with a blinking red light -lrb- x2 blinks -rrb- .
it &#8217; s under warranty so no worries there -lrb- fingers crossed -rrb- but any ideas what it can be ?
and how long to repair &#8211; is it a house visit or a send away ?
-lrb- please , its christmas ! -rrb-
thanks in advance
