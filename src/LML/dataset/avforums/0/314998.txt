samsung ps51d550c1kxxu tv .
hi all , i recently purchased a samsung ps51d550c1kxxu 3d tv and tried to play a dvd on my playstation3 .
this looked like it was set up for 3d but when i tried with my glasses that were recommended for the tv , 3d did n't happen .
does anyone know why this would happen ?
i 've tried with 2 different glasses still nothing .
do i have to do anything else ?
also i have bay windows in the room without curtains , would this effect it even when it 's dark outside ?
any help would be great thanks dawn
