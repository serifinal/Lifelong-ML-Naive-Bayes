samsung ps42q7hd plasma television is making clicking noise and wo n't power on .
hi guys . .
i have a samsung ps42q7hd plasma television making clicking noise and wo n't power on .
the screen lights up for half a second and then goes off .
it just does this continually .
everything that i read about samsung televisions indicate tht it is soe capacitors that are faulty .
i have taken out the power supply an all capacitors seem to be ok with a visual check .
i have checked the 5 vold line and that is quite stable .
i think that it must be the relay that is kicking in abd then out again .
has anybody got any idea how to cure this problem ??? thanks , john c
