panasonic tx-p42g10b - 12 months old - anyone recommend a fair price ? .
been looking on the web , ebay etc and ca n't seem to find any second hand ones for sale at much below price of a new tv maybe just a lack of availibility .
so would anyone have an approx idea of how much they 'd think is an ok price to pay for a second hand tx-p42g10b as far as i know the one i can have if i want it is in good/very good condition & is around 12-18 months old .
