ideas for a new 60 inch tv -lrb- anybody know where to find a pioneer 6090 ?! -rrb- .
hi everyone .
i 'm looking for a tv for the bedroom and would be grateful for any suggestions for a 60 inch screen .
i 'm a plasma fan but open to any suggestions .
i have a pioneer 6090 downstairs and i would love to find another 6090 if anyone knows where to get hold of one or an equivalent -lrb- i know nothing touches the pioneer but the next best will have to do -rrb- .
a friend of mine has the new sony 60 inch but i hate the picture quality on the hd movie channels as it looks unrealistic .
budget is less important than picture quality .
any advice ?
