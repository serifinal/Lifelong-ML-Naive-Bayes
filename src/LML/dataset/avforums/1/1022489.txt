pioneer upgrade advice needed .
my pioneer pdp-427xd is now too small for our living room .
after looking around what was on offer , i went for a panasonic tx-p50g30b as i do n't want 3d .
bearing in mind my pioneer tv is now 5 years old , i plugged in the panasonic and set it up and the picture quality in my opinion was n't as good .
the blacks were slightly blacker but the sound was poor and the colours were no where near as good as my old pioneer .
i 've since returned the panasonic as i was too disappointed in the quality .
do i a , look for a second hand pioneer 50 '' tv or b , buy something else on the market that 's better than my current pioneer and if so , what . . ?
thanks
