what to replace phd8 with ? .
i 'm moving house next week and my trusty old panasonic phd8 is getting a new home in the loft .
i bought the plasma about 6 years ago and at the time lcd 's were not even close to matching the picture quality of it .
is this still true today with lcd/led sets ?
if i stick with plasma , which i almost certainly will , what 's a good choice now ?
looking for a good 50 '' set that does n't cost the earth !!
