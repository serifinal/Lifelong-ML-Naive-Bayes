upgrading from ----- > sony 46x2000 .
hi guys ... some advice please ... basically my parents old phillips crt , has just had its final bow .
so they are going to have my current tv , which is the sony 46x2000 .
my question being , do you recommend me staying with sony for a mid/top end 46 '' model , or go to another manafacturer ?
also , are sony midway between two models -lrb- in otherwords is the 2012 range of tv 's , just around the corner , or ... ? -rrb-
i play a lot games via my ps3 , and also enjoy watchin hd footage via my skyhd box ... .
but am looking at going towards the top end of the 46 '' range ... your advice , would be appreciated ... thanks , jon ...
