what tv to buy for gaming # 650 max ? .
hi guys , i have made 1 or 2 threads asking about specific tv 's but now i have started my search again .
i was set on a panasonic st30 but after hearing about all the problems i have moved away from it .
i want the set to last a while -lrb- 2-3 years -rrb- so i would prefer it to be 3d and also 1080p .
i want a plasma because they seem to be the best for gaming and i believe they produce the best pq available .
i do n't really want a panasonic because of all the problems -lrb- well , i could maybe buy a refurb gt20 or something like that -rrb- so the main brands i 'm looking at are samsung and sony since they seem to have the best reputation -lrb- although i may be mistaken ! -rrb-
so , i have a budget of # 650 to work with and i mostly do gaming -lrb- about 90 % gaming , 9 % blu-ray , 1 % freeviewhd ! -rrb- .
one of the main things is that i want the tv to be able to reduce jaggies a bit .
i know this is a problem with the consoles but i have heard some tv 's are good at jaggies reduction and getting rid of them .
thanks alot !
