plasma - to be or not to be ? .
hi all , thinking of getting a plasma and have a few questions , they may be answered with a quick search but there is no such thing as a quick search on here as this forum is massive i have settled on this plasma , the samsung ps43d450 as i have read its pretty much unbeatable for the price .
my questions are .
i still have sd sky via scart , i know this tech is dinosaur now but is the picture likely to be as degraded as when connecting to some lcd 's via scart ?
any recommendations for a sub # 100 blu ray player to compliment the tv ?
is burn in a thing of the past or is it something to be worried about ?
a lot of tv channels now especially on sky use a stupid image in the corner to tell you what channel you are on so i do n't want it burnt in , it used to ruin the thought of a plasma for me .
do they need calibration or can you work with peoples stock settings on here ?
the thought of paying # 200 + to calibrate a # 300 tv would make me feel a bit ill .
lastly , is the sammy a good buy ?
personally i love them , i own two le32c530 's and they are awesome but plasma is very different tech .
thanks all
