lg 50pv350t , 50pk590 or ?? .
ok guys im in the market for a new tv and i like the look of these two .
both have a lan port but i can only find info on the 590 model saying its dlna compatable which is important to me .
also the 590 has 2 more hdmi connections one is # 550 and the other just under # 600 so its the max i want to pay , reading up on here the tv 's both sound ideal but since theyve been out a while now , does anyone have any negative thoughts since theyve owned one for a while or can i get better for the same money -lrb- not a penny more -rrb- its for watching football and blurays
