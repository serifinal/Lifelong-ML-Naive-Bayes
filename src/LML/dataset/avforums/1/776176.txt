minimum viewing distance for plasma ? .
this is obviously a newbie question .
i am trying to figure out whether plasma or lcd is the correct format for my situation .
my viewing distance is only about 6 to 8 feet .
with a 27 inch sd tv , if i look , i can see the interlacing line structure of the picture .
i am thinking that a 42 '' widesrceen would be a nice size because it keeps the same approximate height of screen image .
what concerns me , though , is that the pixel size of a plasma is visible at this short viewing distance .
i was wondering what people consider as a minimum viewing distance for a plasma .
