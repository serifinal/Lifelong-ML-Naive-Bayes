panasonic st30 vs g30 ? .
i was nearly ready to buy a tv a month or two ago , but decided to stay away from it until i got the rest of the flat sorted , to see how much money was left over after everything else i 'm buying .
i 'm now back looking at tvs , and it still seems to be a panasonic plasma as the best choice for me .
i was reasonably settled on the g30 , but i 've now noticed the st30 , and while i have no need for 3d i 'm wondering if the st30 is a better tv than the g30 .
i 've not heard much talk about the st30 at all , and i ca n't really explain why i 've never considered it .
so i 'd appreciate if anyone could advise if , ignoring 3d entirely , it is a better tv .
