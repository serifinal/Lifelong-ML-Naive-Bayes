samsung ps51d8000 or panasonic tx-p50gt30b .
im after a new 50 '' -55 '' plasma tv around # 1500 .
viewing distance will be approx 11-12ft and use it for sd/hd/games ect .
also like the look of the 59 '' 6900 samsung but dont know if this is going to be a bit big esp with sd viewing ???? i dont mind the big screen just dont want the sd picture to suffer to much with the viewing distance .
any help would be apreciated .
thanks
