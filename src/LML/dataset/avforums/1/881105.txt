is there a 50 '' panasonic plasma tv that doesnt suffer from screen buzz available yet ? .
hey all i 'm on the look out for a new 50 '' panasonic plasma tv -lrb- as i 'm always blown away by the quality of images on the the screens -rrb- .
about a year ago i had a 50 '' panasonic plasma tx-p50g20bbut the buzz -lrb- when there were bright white images on the screen -rrb- was just unbearable , so it had to go back to amazon .
i was wondering whats around today that might suit me that doesnt have this awful problem ?
thanks
