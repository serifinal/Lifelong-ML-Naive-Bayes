panasonic viera tx-p50s30 .
http://www.johnlewis.com/231222456/product.aspx i 've been looking at buying this for a while and i 'm just after some opinions if anyone has bought it and could tell me what they think of it and if they are happy with their purchase .
i was also a bit concerned with `` burn in '' could anyone help to convince me that i wo n't just ruin my tv with burn in ?
is it hard to do and / easy to avoid ?
thank you very much for any help you are able to give me either on burn in or the actual tv itself .
