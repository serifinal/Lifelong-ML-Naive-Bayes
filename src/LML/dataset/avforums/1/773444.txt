samsung ps50c7000 v ps51d6900 .
hey guys ... for those of you had both of these sets , how do they compare in terms of 3d , ghosting/crosstalk , sd quality , hd quality , blinking -lrb- if any ! -rrb-
and general all round performance ?
also i know the d6900 lacks the real black filter of the c7000 , does that make a difference in pic quality ?
my c7000 is being taken away next week for a refund and im looking to replace it with the d6900 .
budget is 1k so cant afford a panasonic and the d6900 is the only model that fits the bill .
ive read through the 6900 owners thread but cant find any comparisons between the 2 models by those who have had both .
any info appreciated .
