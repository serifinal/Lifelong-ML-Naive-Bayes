will a 42 '' be big enough ?
check this photo ... .
i 'm pretty much decided on getting a 42 '' vt30 , and i settled on 42 '' because it was the biggest my wife would agree to .
however ... looking at a paper cut out of a 42 '' screen , i 'm not sure it actually gives me a larger perceived viewing area / viewing angle - maybe a few degrees .
take a look at the pic and see if you think it 's worth having ?
photos is from the seating position , which is 11.5 feet from the wall .
