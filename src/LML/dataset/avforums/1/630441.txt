looking for a 50 '' ish plasma for my new kitchen , seen this samsung unit for about # 495 but its only 720p samsung ps51d450 51 '' hd ready plasma tv | dixons | tv will be used only for watching standard sky tv programs at about 2.5 metres away if sat at table which will give me the best picture quality at this close range ?
