50vt30 vs 64d8000 .
right guys , i need to decide between the panasonic 50vt30 and the samsung 51d8000 .
i could probably go up in size to the 64d8000 but 55 '' panasonic would be a push because of my retailer not stocking it and i do n't wont/can ' t go elsewhere at the moment .
what are the pros and cons of the two sets ?
i am hearing good experiences on both and the vt30
