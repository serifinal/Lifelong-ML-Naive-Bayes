infrared extender for panasonic tv .
i have a p42g20b panasonic tv .
i 'm currently using sky , but will want to switch to the tv 's own freesat when i cancel sky .
unfortunately the centre speaker of my 5.1 system sits infront of the tv , making it impossible to control the tv .
i was wondering if its possible to attach an external infrared module to the tv ?
couldnt seem to find anything on google .
i 'm looking at spending # 20-30 -lrb- no more , as i could put that towards a freesat box -rrb- thanks
