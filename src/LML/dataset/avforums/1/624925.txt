samsung 51d8000 vs 51d6900 plasma .
hi guys , after a dreadful experience with a green blobbed gt30 from a certain japanese manufacturer i am in the market to buy a 2011 samsung plasma -lrb- as i can not bear to wait til the over-priced 2012 models appear -rrb- .
reading the reviews on here and the web i can not really see a vast difference between these two models apart from price and freesat capabilities .
am i missing something ?
i also read that the black levels and response time are actually better on the d6900 -lrb- these are the most important factors for me personally -rrb- .
i was just wondering what owners of these two models have to say regarding these and other aspects , expert opinion would also be greatly appreciated .
i know this may appear lazy but i really have trawled the internet and i am none the wiser .
cheers jay
