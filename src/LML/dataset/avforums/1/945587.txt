panny s30 vs g30 .
hii guys , im already months busy with reading reviews , comparing different plasma etc to decide which will be my new television .
now it comes down to these 2 pannys the s30 and the g30 .
i know the g30 has the better filter , thx mode , lot more options for calibrating .
but im not so sure if these things are important enough for me to warrant a 100 euro price difference ?
now comes the part which is important to me and also confusing . .
thats the internet functionality .
before i read on different sites that the s30 only had easy iptv and not the full viera connect with more online options .
and this was for me a important factor to choose the g30 over the s30 .
however after reading the review of the s30 on this site it says that it does have viera connect !?
also i watched some youtube reviews of the s30 where in some reviews i see only few apps displayed which is easy iptv , but in other video reviews i see the full viera connect display with also the market etc just like the g30 i would be really grateful if somebody could give me some clarity on this aspect i live in holland and i can get the s30 for 445 euro and the g30 for 545 euro .
what would you recommend and why ?
