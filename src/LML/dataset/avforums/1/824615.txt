why is panasonic not calling back the 2011 models ? .
i 'm looking to buy a panasonic -lrb- my first hd tv -rrb- , but decided to hold back due the problems of green blob ,50 hz , fluctuating brightness , other issues etc. .
do these problems occur with all models 10,15,20 and current 30 series ?
why has panasonic not called back the tv 's , i have noted on this forum many people returning the tv 's back for replacement or going for samsung plasma 8000 series ?
