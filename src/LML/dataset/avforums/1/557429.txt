panasonic 50 '' plasma transport and storage .
i 'm getting my new 3d led tv tomorrow and have sold my 50 '' panasonic plasma to a colleague .
i have offered to transport the tv as shes paid a reasonable price but i havent transported one this big before .
am i best to lay it screen down or screen up on a thick duvet and same question for storage till i transport it .
other option is try and fit it in new tv box for transport ??
any ideas ??
