gaming on lg 50pk590 .
looking at getting this tv but have seen a few posts around the web saying its got a bad lag and therfore not the best for gaming and im hoping to be plugging in my ps3 once arrived since its a bit bigger than my existing sammy le46c750 .
i 've seen a few post regarding the pk590 being a good tv but what is it like for fps black ops / moh etc ?
if there is a drawbacks is there a good alternative ?
many thanks
