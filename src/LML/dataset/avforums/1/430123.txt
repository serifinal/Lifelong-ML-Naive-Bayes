time to choose between these two sets .
after ploughing through many threads and review , it has came down to a straight choice for me between pansonic tx-p42s30b and samsung ps-43d450 both have good review despite being at the bottom end of the range , especially the samsung despite only being 780 , i 'm not a gamer and not a big film fan , so it would just be everyday virgin hd use what would the buffs opt for , i 'm upgrading from an old crt lump btw
