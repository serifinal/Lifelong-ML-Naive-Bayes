samsung d6900 vs d550 .
i have read a few reviews etc. with varying results ... one says the d550 black levels are quite a bit worse then the 6900 and another 2 say they are quite close ... it seems the image quality of these 2 is quite similar except the d6900 has a nicer bezel , less reflective coating , internet features and more calibration options ... .
i am not sure if this is worth the extra # 220 over the d550 ... i am not that bothered about internet as it is not that great anyway ... i could live with the reflection but the main things that interest me are : better black levels , is the sd scaling any different ?
hmmm has anyone tried both of these and can tell me how close they are in terms of image quality ?
