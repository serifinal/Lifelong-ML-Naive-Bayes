panny 42g30 - 42gt30 choice woes .
for the last couple if weeks i have been looking for a replacement for my samsung 42in plasma .
afetr reading review after review i narrowed it down to the 42g30 or the 42gt30 .
although i am not bothered with the 3d , the gt has the black pro filter .
then i came across the 50hz bug thread and now i am in a quandry .
has anyone got any advice about this or an alternative to the pannys ?
thanks
