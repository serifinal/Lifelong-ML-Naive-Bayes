isf calibrated lx5090 vs krp-500a which one better please give your opinion .
hi do you have any idea about pq comparetion between lx5090 calibrated and krp-500a non calibrated ?
i heard about moving a calibrated tv to new environment will make calibration unworthy .
the change in room decoration , wall paper colour , light , position near or far from window ... will make the tv not be at best performance .
what happen if i buy a calibrated tv ?
will calibrated 5090 beat 500a in term of picture quality ?
i also hear out-of-box setting of 500a is nearly accurate please advice
