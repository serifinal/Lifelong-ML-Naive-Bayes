tx-p50st30b vs. tx-p50g30b .
hi , i am hesitating between those two models , one of each being 3d but i am not really bothered about this feature but more about the rest , i have looked at their specs and they looks pretty the same to me with small differences .
i was wondering whether it was worth going for the g30 series when i could get a 3d s30 series for # 150 less and nearly the same specs , so confusing !
what do you think between them both ?
which one would you go for ?
thanks
