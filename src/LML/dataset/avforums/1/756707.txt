which 3d glasses for samsung d6900/8000 ? .
i 'll be taking delivery of the ps59d6900 tv from jl in the next few days & it comes with 2 pairs of 3d glasses -lrb- not sure which model -rrb- .
i 'm looking to buy another 4 pairs including 2 pairs kids size .
there seemed to be at least 4 models of 3d glasses in the market atm .
which model would you recommend -lrb- over another -rrb- & why ?
i 'm not fussed with battery/rechargeable but would like something that 's comfortable to wear for few hours & has good performance - i noticed the newer models has nothing to block ambient lights from the sides/behind but are they really better than older model -lrb- e.g. ssg-3100 -rrb- ?
am i right to think that the only kids size model available is the 3300cr ?
thanks
