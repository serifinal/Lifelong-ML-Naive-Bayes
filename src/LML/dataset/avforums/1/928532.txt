panasonic txp65vt30b - or other options .
hi i 'm thinking of buying a 65 inch plasma and am looking at the panasonic txp65vt30b .
reading about some 50hz issues and ?
floating blacks has left me a little worried .
does anybody have knowledge of this model or indeed perhaps suggest another 65 inch screen that maybe better ?
thanks
