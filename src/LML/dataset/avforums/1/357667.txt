gaming only tv up to # 600 .
hi , i would like to know if there are any tvs which are priced up to # 600 that are good for gaming .
i need a tv in my room and will pretty much only use my xbox 360 and playstation 3 on it -lrb- along with the many services provided on these consoles -rrb- .
i also watch some blu-rays on my ps3 .
i want to know if 3d is worth it .
i 'm thinking i probably wont be able to get it at that price range .
thanks for any advice !
oops almost forgot to say it would be 32 '' -lrb- maybe a bit small -rrb- to 42 '' .
thanks !
