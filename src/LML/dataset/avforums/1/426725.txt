retailers offer in store cheaper ? .
im looking to buy a panasonic txp42vt30 .
i noted that the cheapest offers was instore purchase and the online price was more .
ie ` rgb direct ' and ` hiwayhifi ' .
they said the tv 's was in stock , but would not sell me the tv over the phone using credit card , they insisted that i need to come to the store for the offer ?
` hiwayhifi ' has the panasonic txp42vt30 onsale at store for 1045.00 gdp including 5 year panasonic warrenty rgb direct as ir for -lrb- 1289.00 gdp online -rrb- and instore 1189.00 instore including 2 extra 3d glasses , 5 year panasonic warrenty and hdmi cable .
is this some sort of scam as i 'm condused why the online purchase is more and why i need go to the store for a cheaper price ?
