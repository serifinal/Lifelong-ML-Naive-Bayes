would love if someone could help me out , st30 or c7000 .
been pulling my hair out over this .
basically thinking of replacing my le40c580 which as many of you know is a cracking set , with either the panasonic st30 -lrb- 50 '' -rrb- or the samsung c7000 -lrb- 50 '' -rrb- .
| st30 | c7000 both are plasmas and both got good write-ups .
the st30 is currently # 700 with a 5 year warranty but i can get the c7000 for # 500 with a standard year warranty .
is the panasonic one worth the extra # 200 ?
im worried about the panel problems with panasonic 's 2011 line .
will be used purely for hd content -lrb- blurays -rrb- and 3d gaming .
any help would be much appreciated .
thanks
