a 50vt20 for e999 , or wait ?? .
there 's a few going here in ireland , brand new , for e999 .
now i 'm aware of the 50hz thing -lrb- having once owned a 50v20 -rrb- , but i still feel it 's a great tv for the price .
i 'm wondering though , if i were to wait a few months , would i be able to buy a tv from this years range -lrb- not just panasonic , any make -rrb- that may be better ?
at around the same price ?
any views on this ?
thanks ...
