50vt30 or 55vt30 .
hi guys well it looks like i 'm going to swap my 50hz buggy vt20 for a vt30 -lrb- hearing from the dealer tomorrow -rrb- quick question . .
should i go for the 50 '' again or maybe go up to the 55 '' ?
veiwing distance is 9 feet and the online advice seems to say that 55 '' is perfect -lrb- distance = double the screen size -rrb- the 50 '' seemed huge when we got it to replace our old 42 '' so will the 55 '' be too much ?
opinions ?
cheers
