help !
samsung ue46d5520 vs ue46d5000 .
hi everyone , i 'm in the market to buy a new tv .
i currently own a samsung 32 '' led monitor and decided it 's time to buy something bigger .
i have a sky hd full sub , watch mainly sports , movies and xbox , i also have many avi and mkv files -lrb- mainly boxing -rrb- that i like to watch .
i want to stick with samsung , as past experiences have been good , plus the design look sleak .
so , i have finally narrowed it down to two - ue46d5520 vs ue46d5000 , both 46 '' led screens and only slight differences as far as i can see .
i have two questions for anyone out there - i 'm after a tv that can play mkv 's , avi 's but needs to be able to stream live football from the internet , eg 3pm ko 's direct through the tv - i understand the d5000 ca n't do this , does this mean i would need a tv with the smart tv function ?
and finally , in people 's honest opinions , which tv is better , why , plus , am i completely wrong with what i 'm looking at and should be looking at a different model ?
thanks in advance .
