samsung ue37d6100 + 3d player + 2x 3d glasses .
the above package is retailing for around # 670 + .
does anyone know where i can buy it for under # 600 ?
i know there is only # 70 in it but i started out my search looking for a blu ray only and have since moved up to a tv also and now onto complete packages .
after much deliberation and researching i have found the 32 '' version for around # 480 .
my current sony bravia is 32 '' and i would like to upgrade to the 37 '' if possible but i do n't want to break the bank either many thanks
