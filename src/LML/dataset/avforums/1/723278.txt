samsung ps64d8000 or ps59d6900 or wait ? .
hi all !
i have recently returned my samsung ps63c7000 for a refund due to blinking and sync issues and at the moment putting up with a 40 '' led which is quite a shock in size !
so the dilema - do i go for the ps64d8000 or maybe the ps59d6900 or wait to see if the new models have moved on ?
not sure what the difference is betwen the 64d8000 and 59d6900 apart from size and finish ?
would appreciate help as just not sure what to do!cheers
