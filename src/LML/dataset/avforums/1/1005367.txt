hdmi cable for panasonic 50vt30 .
i am looking to buy a panasonic 50vt30 soon but have a question ... i currently have a high quality hdmi cable installed into the wall to my av amplifier ... its only 1.3 will this work at all if supplying the tv with full 1080p 3d ?
or will i need to replace the cable for it to work ?
thanks
