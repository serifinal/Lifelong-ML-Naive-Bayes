fao those who have had to return panny plasmas - how easy was it ?
who did you use ? .
hi guys im in the market for a 50-55 '' tv and im looking at the gt/vt models .
for me - i think the green blob risks are worth it .
i will be buying with a extended 5 year warranty for sure !
however - in the -lrb- reasonable -rrb- event that i will have to return the tv if it develops the dreaded green blobs - im wondering how easy this will be ?
the last thing i want is for the tv to become faulty and i have to mess around with engineers coming over , trying to replace components , weeks without a tv etc !
so - assuming you have had to return a panny plasma : 1 -rrb- how easy was it to replace ?
2 -rrb- who provided the warranty ?
panny 1 yr , panny/rs/lewis extended etc etc that way - i will be buying the set from the company with the most generous returns policy
