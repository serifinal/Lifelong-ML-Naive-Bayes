is it worth selling my pioneer krp-500a to get a panasonic 50vt30b ? .
are the new panasonic plasmas -lrb- 50vt30b -rrb- better than my pioneer krp 500a ?
i know panasonic has 3d and internet , but reading reviews , they say the best plasma ever !
but is the picture quality really as good as the pioneer ??
