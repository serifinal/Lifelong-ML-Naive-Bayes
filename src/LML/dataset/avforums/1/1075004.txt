help me spend my money !
pls . .
guys , i have some cash that is burning a hole in my pocket .
i could afford the 436xde but i 'm not happy spending all that on a tv as i want a bit of spare cash for a rainy day blah blah blah .
in the main it will be used by the kids to watch boomerang most days and the misses eastenders .
after all that i get my gaming time on the 360 .
i know that the pwd7 and pwd8 's are great plasma 's and i can get one around &#163; 1200 .
however do i spend the extra &#163; 300 - &#163; 400 and go for the samsung ps42s5hx hd plasma ?
or any other models you recommend ?
i know ideally you need to spend as much as you can to get the best possable screen but i 'm not comfortable spending that extra &#163; 1k on the screen .
thanks ,
