how to add dvb-c functionality ? .
hi , i have a tx-p50g20b uk panasonic .
unfortunately it does not have the dvb-c functionality .
actually i notice that dvb-c is available for a specific list of countries for the same model : dvb-c feature is available only in following countries : / sweden -lrb- comhem , canal digital -rrb- , demark -lrb- yousee -rrb- ... how can i add this functionality to my uk version of the g20 ?
do i need to add an additional hardware module to support dvb-c ?
is it real to be done ?
where can i buy it ?
i would replace dvb-s or dvb-t with dvb-c in my case .
i know , here are lot of expects on this forum .
i really need your help as i need the dvb-c functionality on my tv .
thank you very much .
