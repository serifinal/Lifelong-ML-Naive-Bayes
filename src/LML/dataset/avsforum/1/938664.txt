question : samsung a550/a650 or sony xbr6 .
hey everyone , i am trying to decide on a replacement for my samsung 24 '' lcd -lrb- pc monitor -rrb- .
i am looking for a 32 '' to wall mount and i am wondering which is my best option .
my primary use will be desktop use -lrb- internet browsing & desktop applications -rrb- , followed by gaming , and occassionally watching bluray movies -lrb- via cheap internal sony sata player -rrb- .
my viewing distance is about 3-4 feet .
i have narrowed my search down to these 3 choices : 1 -rrb- samsung ln-32a550 @ $ 900 2 -rrb- samsung ln-32a650 @ $ 1000 3 -rrb- sony kdl-32xbr6 @ $ 1000 ps : i do n't want all the comparison of 120hz vs 60hz , just which would you choose given what i am using it for and price breakdown .
