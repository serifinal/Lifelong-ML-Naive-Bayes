is now the best time to pick up a 720p plasma ? .
i 'm in the market for a 50 '' plasma and would love a panny pz800u , but budget dictates a panny px80u or sammy a450 .
i 've seen both the panny and sammy for 25 % off msrp , which is about $ 900 less than the pz800u 's best sale price .
i realize the cheaper models are only 720p , but from my seating distance and current hd offerings i will barely be able to see the difference .
i know i would get deeper blacks and somewhat better colors with the higher end model , but from reading the forums here both cheaper sets are still pretty darn good .
i do n't suspect we 'll see 720p offerings in next years plasma line-up , so is picking one up now a steal of a deal ?
do you think they will go down anymore by nov -lrb- if i got the pz800u i was going to wait till nov anyway -rrb- ?
