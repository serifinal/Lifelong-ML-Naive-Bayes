for those of you who bought vizio tvs a year ago , are you still happy ? .
just wondering if those of you who bought vizio tv back when the hype was going on are still happy with your purchase .
i am considering the vu32l at circuit city .
i do n't have a lot that i can spend on a tv , and yet i keep hearing `` buy quality and cry once '' in my head .
i checked out the tv in person , and it looks like it would be fine for my needs , which would mostly be sd tv .
i just want to know about the reliability of these tvs .
thanks !
