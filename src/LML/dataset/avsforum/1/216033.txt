home theater noob needs some help w / onkyo 605 and sony dg910 .
i 'm getting ready to take a jump into the home theater market and put together a system soon .
i 'm trying to get some research done and have narrowed it down to the onkyo 605 and sony 910 .
i like the 910 because it has 3 hdmi and i know the 605 has gotten rave reviews on here but i noticed some people have mentioned the popping .
i was wondering if i could get any further feedback on either one .
other quick home theater questions : what is a better bet for speakers , getting a `` box set '' or buying individual center/book shelf/etc ?
will these receivers take a 5.1 and change it to 7.1 ?
what is the deal on the onkyo 576 ?
has anyone had the chance to use one or heard any preliminary things ?
i should probably mention i 'm on a budget of sorts .
thanks for any help !
