ca n't wait to hear the reviews ... i will be buying one or the other - i am pretty sure of that ... but , honestly , i hear one buyer saying that he would have not bought a non-elite had he known about the lack of service menu and some of the other calibration features ... so ... the question is ... which one are you buying and why ?
