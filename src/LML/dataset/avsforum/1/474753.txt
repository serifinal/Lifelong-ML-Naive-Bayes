circuit city is going to swap my hlt 6176s for a 650 or 750 samsung model which shoul .
circuit city price matched best buy , so i got $ 100 back and i have had my hlt6176s for 3 months , they gave me a $ 100 back already , and if i decided to go with the 650 they will give me $ 300 back , i paid $ 1,889.99 for my 6176s .
my ?
is which is better the 650 or the 750 , the 650 's i have seen in the stores seem to have geometry issues where the 750 's appeared to be pretty good .
the 650 seems to have a better pic but that could have also been the hook , does the 750 have a real pixel look to the pic ?
thanks
