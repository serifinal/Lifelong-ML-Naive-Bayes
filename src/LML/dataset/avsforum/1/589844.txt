yet another plasma vs lcd but specifics .
ok guys here is my problem .
i 've done the research and been to the stores ... i do n't know the answer and i 'm sick of internalizing the conflict anymore so i 'm asking ... .
room - living room , 3 casement windows directly opposite tv and 2 windows on the side .
obviously not perfect for a ht , but we live with our situations .
currently a 32inch crt resides here .
replacement - plasma or lcd .
i like plasma over lcd for pq , colors , details etc. .
however , i 'm very concerned about reflection , it does bother me on the current crt .
lcd , i could almost buy an lcd , but currently am so annoyed with the motion blur i see on some of my friend 's tvs .
and it seems most 120hz sets are both pricy and glossy , which to me defeats the purpose of the lcd , the glossy part .
the tv search started with a 6ave electronics ad with a 50 inch plasma for $ 1k , which was a last year model , was n't as impressive as current models ... .
i 've since been impressed with the samsung a450 , which grew into the a550 , then there were the pz80 and px80 twins calling my name , then the sony and samsung lcds .
all in all , i was hoping to spend 1-1500 which has grown to , ok but it has to be under 2k and was looking at the 50-52inch size .
anyone got suggestions for my problem , a plasma that does n't reflect or an lcd without blur that is niether glossy nor pricey ?
right now , i 'm thinking screw it , i 'll buy a 720p plasma , live with the reflection and be happy i spent half of a similar tv , if someone does n't have the answer , cause i 'm doing my normal reseach it until i 'm so sick of thinking about it that i do n't care what i get anymore .
