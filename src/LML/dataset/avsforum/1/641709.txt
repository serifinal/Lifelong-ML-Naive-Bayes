.
as i 've been weighing the pros and cons of choosing between the polk audio rm10 and buying some bic america speakers to build my 5.1 system , i began wondering : do any of these speakers come with the necessary wires to connect them to the receiver , or should i be buying wires separately ?
hdmi cables , i know i need to connect the inputs -lrb- xbox , playstation , etc. -rrb- , but i have seen a lot of discussion about speaker wires -lrb- and `` banana plugs , '' which i still do n't get -rrb- , and am not sure which wires i should/need to be buying separately .
sorry for the clueless post , and thanks !
