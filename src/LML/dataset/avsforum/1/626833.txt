sony vs. samsung lcd flat panel .
i want to purchase the samsung ln52a630 or ln52a550 , but my friend wants me to get a sony because it 's `` better '' and i will be sorry for getting a samsung .
the reason why i opted for a samsung was because of word of mouth , internet reviews , etc. .
what sony model is comparable to the samsung for around the same price ?
i will switch if it 's a better value .
