help !!!
which set should i get samsung 750 or 650 ??
only 2 hours to decide . .
i currently have the samsung 630 and i am not to have about the black levels in this tv .
the blacks are more like dark grey .
i went back to the department store and i have a salemans who said they can sell me the 750 for the same price as the 650 .
which is 300.00 more than the 630 i just got .
i love the blacks in the 650/750 and the 630 screen reflects just as much as the 650/750 .
i heard that the 750 are having alot of halo effect problems and the 650 just has a ugly bezel .
can some of guys give me some advice .
i have about 2 hours to think on it .
