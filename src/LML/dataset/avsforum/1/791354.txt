looking at buying a panny th-42pz85u -- a couple questions .
i am looking to buy , probably this weekend , and the th-42pz85u has been recommended .
i do n't think i can sell the larger size to my wife .
a couple questions : 1 .
is this still a recommended panny or is there another one in that size i should be looking at ?
2 .
i see that it will do 24p , but not `` cinematic '' 24p .
i assume the cinematic is without the 2:3 pulldown .
so , should i care ?
i will able to deliver 24p through my hd-dvd player .
3 .
are the speakers enough to get by on until we hook it up to an outboard stereo or ht unit ?
any information would be appreciated .
thanks ,
