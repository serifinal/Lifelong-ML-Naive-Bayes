advanced setup questions for the onkyo tx sr806 .
the setup - panasonic th-50pz85u -lrb- 50 '' plasma -rrb- directtv receiver/dvr hr21-100 onkyo tx-sr806 av/receiver panasonic dmp-bd50 blu-ray dvd player a pair of norh prism 5.2 and a norh prism 4.1 center speaker with a pair of old bose for the back surround speakers .
i connected the directtv/dvr and the bd player to the receiver with hdmi and optical cables .
the hdmi out on the avr goes to hdmi1 on the tv .
i have done the basic setup but am reluctant to go further since i am unsure of what i 'm doing now .
when i first turned on the tv after installing the onkyo avr , it seemed that the picture was noticeably better - even though we were blown away by the quality of the hd picture before we installed the avr .
but my understanding is that since i am using an hdmi connection , it just passes through the feed without any processing .
so is it just us or is there some video processing going on ?
more importantly , should i do anything with the video settings on the av receiver or just leave at whatever the default is ?
-lrb- i am not crystal clear on this ` progressive ' or ` interlaced ' format thing .
i really do n't know what to do with all these video setting options on the avr -rrb- another thing i am unsure about is thx .
the manual for the sr806 gives confusing tables -lrb- for someone like me -rrb- about audio format support .
the way i read it , to be able to get thx sound , it looks like i will need 6 or 7 speakers instead of the 5 i have currently .
is that correct ?
if anyone has a similar configuration could they advise me how i should proceed with the remainder of my setup for the onkyo ?
thanks very much .
