sharp lc42d64u or samsung ln40a550 .
well today i 'm going to be buying one of these tv 's since they are both on sale .
until a few days ago i was completely set on getting the d64 but i 'm been really leaning on the samsung .
it 's 2 '' less but for $ 200 less i 'm willing to go with it if the pq is better .
so which tv is better ?
thanks sharp aquos lc42d64u http://www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/prodde...47&catid=24558 or samsung ln40a550 http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/pro...099946&catid=#
