will panasonic ever release a receiver for blu-ray and new hd audio formats .
is there anything in the works by panny to release new av receiver that supports the new hi-def audio formats ?
i have an xr55 which i will be replacing soon .
i love the xr55 and hoping panny will release a new hdmi 1.3 receiver .
