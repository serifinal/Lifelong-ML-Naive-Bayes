what are the top 5 lcd makes/models at the moment ? .
im going to be wanting to upgrade my tv here soon .
ive always been a plasma fan but lcd 's have came a long way recently so i thought i would take a second look at them before i discount getting one .
what are some of the most recommended lcd 's this year ?
last time i was on here the sharps was one of the tops but everybody complained about banding .
what are the best ones now ?
which ones can compete with plasma black levels ?
also are there any good lcd 's around the 60 inch mark ?
so far the only one ive seen that is bigger than 52 '' is the samsung 81 series and they are way to expensive .
im looking to spend no more than $ 3000 .
