hauppauge hd pvr vs blackmagic intensity pro to record from directv satellite .
hi , i 'm looking to capture hd and sd content from a directv satellite reciever .
as far as i know , the options are hauppauge hd pvr or blackmagic intensity pro .
is there a consensus on which one is better ?
i 'm leaning toward the hauppauge because it 's newer and i 've used and liked hauppauge products before .
are there any problems with it ?
thanks for the help .
