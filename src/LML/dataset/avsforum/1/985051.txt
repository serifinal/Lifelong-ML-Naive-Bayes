parasound 2250 or sunfire cinema grand .
i 've never had a separate power amp before -lrb- using a denon 3803 -rrb- but am shopping for a new pair of floorstander speakers and feel like i might want a little more power .
i know a guy selling a used parasound 2250 250-watt 2ch -lrb- $ 600 used -rrb- and a sunfire cinema grand 200-watt 5ch -lrb- $ 700 used -rrb- .
i have a 5.1 system but mostly interested in improving my 2 channel sound and could continue to use my receiver for the center channel and surrounds .
i also was wondering about the outlaw audio 200-watt monoblocks -lrb- $ 350 apiece -rrb- .
i 'm trying to stay under $ 800 , but obviously i do n't want to get something that does n't offer substantial improvement over my denon in terms of quality .
any opinions on these amps are appreciated .
