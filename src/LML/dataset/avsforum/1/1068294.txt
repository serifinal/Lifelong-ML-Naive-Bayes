samsung a550 vs. sony v3000 .
ok so i 've used the search extensively before i posted this , and i do n't have access to a b&m store at the moment to actually check out these sets side by side , but here goes ... i 'm looking for a 40 '' set around the $ 1500 mark to be used for mostly xbox 360 gaming and some 480p dvd watching .
i 'm pretty set on either the sony or the samsung , here 's what i 'm lookin for .
which of these sets has the most 3d pop/depth to it ?
i would like the glossiest screen possible and something that is n't going to blur/smear/pixelate / macroblock during fast movement .
i 'm also going to use it with my laptop and will be sitting close and want the sharpest possible set .
should i wait until the new sony 's come out in april or go with an ln40a550 or 40v3000 now ?
