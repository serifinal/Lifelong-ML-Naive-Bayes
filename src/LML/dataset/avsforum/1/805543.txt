pioneer elite pro 1150 vs. panny th-42px80u .
here 's a tough question -lrb- well , maybe not for all the pro 's around here -rrb- that needs some expertise , which i ai n't got .
i was all set to buy a panasonic 42 inch plasma 720 th-42px80u from bb using pm to costco for $ 899 .
with $ 100 off rebate , plus several gift cards , and 12 % off coupon , etc etc , with credit card in hand , totalling $ 650 w/o tax when i got completely turned upside down .
after several hours of mind numbing product talk , but realizing this sales person really did know a bit about plasmas , he proceeded to offer me a pioneer elite pro-1150 at the smashing ` needs to get it out the door ' clearance price of $ 1500 .
now , i 'm not usually persuaded to purchase last years prada 's let alone last years pioneers , but do i consider 1 -rrb- 42 ' vs 50 ' , 2 -rrb- both are great deals , 3 -rrb- never thought i could squeeze up to an elite bracket , 4 -rrb- i do believe both are remarkable hds but at different class levels as well as different generations .
i need to know considering all these points , is it obvious that the pioneer is the better tv despite its vintage , or should i get the brand spankin panny .
both are a great price , yes ?
help !!!
