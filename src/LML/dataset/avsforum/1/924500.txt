samsung 650 vs 750 .
i 've been looking into getting a 46 '' samsung 650 for quite some time and am ready to pull the trigger finally and my parents are going to get a 52 '' of their own as well .
one thing i 've noticed though is that i 've found the price of the 750 46 '' model to be within $ 100 of the 650 .
i 've been set on the 650 since before summer but now might need to check into getting the 750 if it worth the extra for the features .
i do n't have a surround sound system yet so the woofer could be nice .
my biggest worry is the halo effect that i 've read about the 750 series and the fact that it is n't a swivel stand .
anybody have any comments that have both models or have spent significant time with each ?
