sony kdl46s4100 or samsung ln46a540 .
i can get the sony at best buy for $ 1199 and i can get the samsung at sam 's for the same price .
i leaning samsung , but ca n't decide .
this will be mainly for just watching tv in the master bedroom .
regular tv and some movies - probably not for gaming or much sports .
any opinions ?
thanks !!
