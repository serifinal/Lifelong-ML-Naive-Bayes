official pioneer 5020 vs panny 800u thread .
i believe this is a good thread for many of us who are trying to decide between the two .
i know the blacks are better on the pio but it costs about $ 500 - $ 700 more .
panny might have an advantage in color accuracy especially with the thx cert .
i am not concerned with connectivity or how well they look in a lighted room , just pq black levels , processing , etc. .
i have not seen any reviews on the 5020 but the 5080 received very good reviews from sites such as cnet .
i can not do a direct compare as i am not very close to a bb or cc and nobody in my hometown even has a 800u or 5020 .
please limit your posts to these two models only .
