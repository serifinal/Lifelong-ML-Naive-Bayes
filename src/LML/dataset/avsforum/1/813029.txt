panasonic pz85 or pz800 ? .
i 'm looking at both of these models in 50 '' and was wondering : is the thx mode of the pz800 worth the extra money -lrb- 400-500 more -rrb- ?
other than that both tv 's seem just about identical ... or is there something else i 'm missing ?
the tv will be in a good sized living room with full widows on the north side -lrb- although really only football gets watched during the day -rrb- .
viewing distance is about 8-10ft .
sound goes through the stereo .
we mostly watch direct tv hd , movies through an oppo up-converting dvd , and sports -lrb- football and hockey -rrb- .
will be upgrading to blu-ray once the quality goes up and price comes down .
we have to drive 2 hrs to be able to compare sets side by side so any and all comments are appreciated .
