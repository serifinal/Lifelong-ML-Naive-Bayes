opinion on bose acoutimass 10 series iii .
many years ago i thought this was the best speaker system for surround sound , but it may be different today .
i always have had a hard time hearing the high end sounds and thought these were a very bright speaker if that 's the right term for it which made them appeal to me .
i always seem to have to crank up the volume to hear the highs and my wife was always telling me it 's too loud .
a local guy is selling a new system for $ 650 which i think is a pretty good deal , i think it 's a series 3 because it has a powered subwoofer and the center channel speaker is a double cube , but i may be wrong .
do you think i should go for it or is there another system i should look at in that price range .
reviews seem to be mixed but that was based on the system costing $ 1000 .
