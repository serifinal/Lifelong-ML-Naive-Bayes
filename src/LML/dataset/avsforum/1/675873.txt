toshiba 42rv530u vs samsung lnt4061 .
i 've been doing alot of research for the past year or so for getting a new lcd .
i 've been out and just looking at the pictures and seeing what one 's `` view '' the best .
i 've currently got an older toshiba crt but i am also a fan of samsung .
the regza rv530u and the samsung lnt61f are pretty compariable when it comes to the specs .
i was wondering if anyone have any comments if they were trying to decide between the two .
i 've read both threads on each tv themselves but have n't seen anything about one person getting one and then returning it to get the other .
is there anything i should really watch out for in either of the tvs ?
thanks .
