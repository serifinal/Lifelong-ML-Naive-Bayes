need an opinion samsung ln46a750 or pn50a650 .
ok well i have been out recently to replace my samsung hp-s4253 which is a 42in plasma and i have looked at both the pn50a650 and ln46a750 .
besides the obvious differences of 50in vs 48in and plasma vs lcd what else are the differences between these two displays ?
i am mostly looking to enjoy great football , dvds , and bluray !
any opinions would be great to hear !
