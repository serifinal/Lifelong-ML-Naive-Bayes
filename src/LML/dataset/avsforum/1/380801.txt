fairly simple question for those of you who know more than me .
we are just starting to look for a new tv for our bedroom .
it will be used mostly for sd viewing for the time being , hopefully not for too long .
it is a fairly light room , with a couple of big windows , but will be used at night , 80-90 % of the time .
my question for all of you is , what would be a better choice for this application , plasma or lcd ?
while we 're at it , we will be looking in the 32 '' -40 '' range , and want to get the best bang for the buck we can , at around the $ 700 range .
i 'm hoping to get something on the day after thanksgiving , to hopefully stretch my dollar a little further .
fire away with your thoughts , and thanks in advance .
