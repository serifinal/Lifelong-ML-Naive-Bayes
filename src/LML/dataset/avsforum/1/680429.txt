need advice on 37 '' bedroom tv .
hello all - i 'm looking to upgrade my bedroom tv set from a 32 '' crt to a 37 '' hdtv - and no , no 40 '' tvs - i had a hard time getting my wife to agree on 37 '' over 32 '' .
i have n't decided on lcd vs. plasma , but the wo n't be a significant glare/brightness problem , so i 'm leaning plasma .
mostly , the tv will be used for watching -lrb- initially non-upscaled -rrb- dvds , with later purchase of a blu-ray player .
i certainly do n't need 120hz on this set , and wo n't quibble about 720p vs. 1080p - but i 'd go with a 1080p set if the price was n't significantly higher .
i do n't foresee needing > 2 hdmi ports , but i do want optical audio out on the tv -lrb- need it to hook into my existing 5.1 all-in-one 5-disc dvd theater in a box setup -rrb- .
so , anyone have any recent experience with 37 '' models ?
what recommendations do you have ?
i 'm looking to pick up the set on black friday , so i want to be prepared with the top two or three models to look for in the ads -lrb- so that i have a backup plan -rrb- .
also , as another minor factor , my main set is a 47 '' philips 120hz 1080p with ambilight -lrb- 47pfl9432 -rrb- , which i absolutely love -lrb- in no small part due to the ambilight feature -rrb- - os , if anyone knows a good place that i could get an older philips 37 '' model with ambilight , i would probably put that as my first choice .
thanks !
