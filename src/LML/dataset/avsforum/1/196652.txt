pioneer elite 110 vs new 5020 ? .
i have read many posts about 9g models to come out , and all the great things about the 8g elite line .
seems to be the expected msrp of 5020 is going to be in the $ 3500 range .
my question is this .
if there are any 110 's left on the market when 5020 's come out -lrb- june -rrb- , they might be very close in price to each other .
what would you buy if this were the case ?
my reasoning is that the elites are suppposed to come out in late july/early august , right ?
it would make sense that they will discount any 8g elite 's to make room for new 9g 's .
so , if the 5020 has deeper blacks but similar color reproduction as the 5010 , is it a better deal than a elite 110 with not as great blacks , but more accurate color ?
i am looking at this from a pq point of view .
i know this may be hypothetical at best if the 110 's are going as fast as everyone says they are .
