42pz80u or 42px80u my best choice over pioneer ? .
i 've got a grand to spend . .
i do n't want to go overboard on a tv ... just picked up a philips lcd today .
.1080 , 29000:1 dynamic contrast , 60hz , 5 ms response , etc. ... while i 'm happy with it , i do n't think i can deal with the motion blur ... so i 'm looking at picking up a plasma to hook up to my other hd box and compare the two during the day and at night ... i 'm going to compare the two and most likely return the lcd ... .
here 's what i have living room where the tv will be viewed from 3 '' to 8 '' away depending on where you sit . .
i 'm pretty much already decided on a 42 '' , so leave the size discussion out please .
i play alot of fps video games and watch alot of sd content during the day . .
at night i watch hd channels and play some ps3 . .
the bay window has sun beating directly in until about 1:00 and the room is still bright thru-out the whole day ... this is why i choose lcd . .
the motion blur is just unbearable to me . .
so i 've been looking around at 42 '' plasmas ... i found two in my price range .
panasonic 42pz80u and 42px80u . .
i 've heard good thing about pioneers ... is there a good 42 '' pioneer in my price range that can compete against the 42px80u -lrb- the 720 version -rrb- the reason i list both the 42pz80u and 42px80u in my price range is becuase i can get both online in my price range ... the only one i can get locally in my price range is the 42px80u ... i 'm sure in the next few months the 42pz80u will be in my price range locally ... the 42pz80u locally currently would be out of my range . .
i would probably purchase the 42px80u locally and pay the same as a 42pz80u online since i can return it easier . .
is there much of a `` noticeable '' difference between the two @ 3 '' away ?
is this the hands down best tv for under $ 1000.00 any other tv 's i should `` look at '' and compare for myself , or is the under $ 1000 market pretty much wrapped up by panasonic ?
thanks in advance . .
note : i 'm not opposed to looking at lg ... even vizio or other generic brands .
i 'm more focused on picture quality in my price range ... would a $ 1000 lg or vizio be better than a $ 1000 42px80u -lrb- or 42pz80u -rrb- oh yea : are any of these better in bright rooms ... that 's going to be a major concern for me ... thanks
