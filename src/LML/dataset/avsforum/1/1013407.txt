.
hello all so i 've been researching an lcd tv for quite awhile now , and i 've come to sort of a wall when it comes to these three tv 's , they 're all relatively in the same neighborhood of prices , but i ca n't quite decide which one is better or the right one , so i 'm asking for your help .
the 3 tv 's are ... toshiba regza 52 '' 1080p 120hz lcd hdtv ** -lrb- 52xv545u -rrb- $ 1900 samsung 52 '' 1080p 120hz flat-panel lcd hdtv ** -lrb- ln52a630 -rrb- $ 2200 samsung 52 '' 1080p 120hz flat-panel lcd hdtv ** -lrb- ln52a750 -rrb- $ 2500 so as you can see they 're 3 pretty great tv 's so i wan na know what you all think of this , and help me in choosing one , and if you pick one of the slightly more expensive tv 's i 'd like help on knowing if that particular tv is worth the extra price .
any and all help is appreciated , thanks !
