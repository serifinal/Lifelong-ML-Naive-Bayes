what is the difference between a cheap sub and an expensive one ? .
http://cgi.ebay.com/new-ma-audio-ma1...#ht_3619wt_909 i 've been looking at getting this $ 150 dollar 18 '' sub and building my own box for it .
but i 'm wondering what difference i will notice between this one and a more expensive or even cheaper 18 '' sub would be ?
the box will be the same and the amp will be the same , but the specs on each of the subs are a little different .
