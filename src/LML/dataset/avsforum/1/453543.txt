.
hey guys , i know this sounds ridiculous , but i need a new tv , and i 've narrowed it down to two optoins : i have a chance to get a new 60 '' kuro for 2800-2900 with wall mount -lrb- i believe it 's the new 8th gen -rrb- through a contact , or a samsung hl67a750 at the best price i can find online -lrb- 1847 + ship right now -rrb- .
i know the kuro is a better picture , but is it worth the extra grand , and 7 inches ?
the size of the set does n't necessarily matter for me .
i 'm just starting out , bought a house a few weeks ago , and money is n't extremely tight , but i do n't exactly have tons of it lying around , and i also have a honeymoon to pay for **** no , i can not get you this deal on the kuro , do n't ask ****
