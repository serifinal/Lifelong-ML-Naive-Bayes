samsung 81 series vs samsung 9 series ? .
i am trying to figure out if i can get a better tv than 60 '' kuro some of the options that come to mind are 55 '' series 9 and 52 '' series 81 samsungs now i can more or less figure out what the tradeoff between samsung vs kuro is but i do n't really understand what the difference is as far as series 81 vs series 9 ?
also , i live in brooklyn , ny - can you tell me what store i could visit to see either series 81 or series 9 ?
my viewing distance by the way will be 8 feet .
the room has three windows and is not a dedicated ht room so i do expect to have light in it in daytime .
also is there anything else i should consider ?
does sony have led backlit tvs worth considering ?
