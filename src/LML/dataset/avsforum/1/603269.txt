worth waiting for black friday for an hdtv this year ? .
i know it 's early , but curious if anyone has any insights or guesses yet as to whether the holiday shopping season will be worth waiting for this year ?
our primary tv , a 6 yr old 32 '' toshiba crt died out this week .
i had hoped to get another year before switching to hd , but i find myself suddenly in need of a new set .
because of several other things that have hit the past two weeks , i find myself needing to be price conscious , so am wondering if i should pick up a cheap 27 '' rca sd in order to hold us over until the end of the year deals start kicking in , or just pick up one of the lower priced models that seem to be floating around right now -lrb- 37 '' westinghouse from buy.com or 42 '' panny/samsung plasmas -rrb- .
any input appreciated .
thanks , mike
