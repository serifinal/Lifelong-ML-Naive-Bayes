which is better : samsung lnt4665f or samsung ln40a550 ? .
i am looking to get a nice lcd , but am thinking about buying a refurbished unit to keep it in my budget .
what are your thoughts on the samsung 46 '' lnt4665f lcd vs. the samsung 40 '' ln40a550 lcd ?
here are the links : http://www.secondact.com/product/ln4...furbished.html http://www.secondact.com/product/lnt..._lnt4665f.html the 46 '' is about $ 100 more than the 40 '' .
i am trying to decide if the extra size is worth it , or if i should go with the 550 which is smaller but is a newer model .
your help is appreciated .
thanks !
