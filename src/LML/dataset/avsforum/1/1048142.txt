same price : bic h-100 or klipsch synergy sub-12 .
hello guys , i have been reading the forum for a while now and it has helped me so much in my first home theater purchase .
this is my first post because i could not seem to find a direct comparison by searching .
i can get the klipsch synergy sub-12 for about the same price as the bic h-100 .
the h-100 gets great reviews on the forum , but most are in reference to its $ 250 price range .
if i can get the klipsch sub-12 for around that price , would that be a better sub for the money ?
i will be using it for music and movies regularly .
hopefully someone out there can share their experience with both .
thanks a lot , mike
