help - receiver died - where to start ? .
my old denon gave up the ghost tonight and now i do n't have sound for my main tv not to mention the ht .
i 'm out of touch with the new tech so i 'm hoping some of you might point me in the right direction as the dw will want her sunday night tv which means i 'm buying tomorrow -lrb- less than ideal -rrb- .
i have a 5.1 system -lrb- no chance of changing that -rrb- with paradigm studios across the front and as surrounds with an hsu sub .
i was also looping a russound through the denon so that it would play through the ht system as well as in 6 other zones .
would prefer to stay under $ 1,000 if possible .
it 's also time to step up to a blu-ray so that 'll be on the shopping list as well but not urgent at all .
i guess i 'm predisposed to denon but i 've read a number of threads , stickies and the information is overwhelming .
is there such a thing as say a top 5 list to help narrow it down ?
thanks in advance .
