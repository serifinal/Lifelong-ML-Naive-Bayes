sony xbr6 soft vs w4100 .
my wife and i went to a couple of stores yesterday , sears and cc , to look at the above 2 hdtvs .
we both felt that the xbr6 looked noticeably softer than the w4100 .
one store rep said that this was because of a connection issue but after he left i got behind the tvs and both were running off the same wires with the same programming .
the cc rep said that he could see it also but did not know what would cause it .
thank goodness for an honest rep !
would anyone care to please comment on whether they have seen this also or what might be the reasons behind it .
if it were one store , i could see there being multiple reasons as to why this might be but to have the sets act the same way in both stores seems a bit odd .
especially when the xbr unit is supposed to be the better of the 2 units .
thank you ,
