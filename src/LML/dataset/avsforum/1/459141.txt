17 mbps vs 24 mbps .
hi all , i 'm looking at getting a camcorder soon .
i am debating between the sony sr10/11/12 and the canon hf11 .
i was wondering what the difference in picture quality is at the higher bit rate on the hf11 .
the only reason i am considering the hf11 is because it 's the only camera out with the 24mbps ability -lrb- however i do prefer the large storage space on the sr10/11/12 -rrb- .
thanks for any information , - ifandbut
