is it worth the $ 30 diffrence ?
750 vs 650 .
the 750 came down in price again !
but really going crazy choosing between the two -lrb- 650 or 750 -rrb- the price diffrence is $ 30 right now .
do u guys recomend the 750 over the 650 at $ 30 bucks ?
what about the halo ?
i 've heard they now come with new angled bezels .
also about the `` halo '' .
when i read the reviews on amazon , com no one really talks about this problem , only here on avs forums .
well hope to hear from u guys !!
