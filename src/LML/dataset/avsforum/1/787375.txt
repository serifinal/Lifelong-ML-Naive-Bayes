.
hi all , i currently have a pair of bose 701s -lrb- front and sub -rrb- and a pair of 301s -lrb- rear -rrb- .
i am going to replace my tv with a flat pannel .
so i am looking to replace my speakers with a different set -lrb- small sizes -rrb- .
what are the best sets from $ 500 to $ 1000 ?
thanks , hdp .
