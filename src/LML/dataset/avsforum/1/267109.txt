px80 vs pz80 vs pz85 .
hi i 'm a newcomer to the world of large flat panel screens .
at first i was determined i should going lcd , with either samsung or panasonic at the top of my list .
but the more i look at these in various store displays and especially when being fed good bd content , the more i am inclined towards the natural film like look of plasma .
the panasonic viera line seems to offer great value and i am narrowing my choice to either the px80 , pz80 or pz85 .
i a getting the smallest plasma available , the 42 '' .
is the $ 400 price difference between the px80 and pz85 worth it ?
at an approximately 6-8 ft viewing distance , will i appreciate the extra 1080p that the 85 offers ?
