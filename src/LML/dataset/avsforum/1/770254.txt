amazon selling sony 920 for amazing price .
well its been 2 months for me researching on receivers .
still undecided about my choice between onkyo 606 , yamaha 663 , pioneer 1018 and sony 920 .
this evening i saw amazon selling 920 for only 357 bucks .
only onkyo is close to this price range .
but since onkyo has few minor issues like over heating , 1080i vs 1080p upscaling and bad interface , i am leaning more towards the sony .
i have rest of the stuff ready to be hooked up to the receiver .
polk audio 6750 5.1 speaker system , sony bd 350 and my vizio lcd .
i am looking for a receiver for this combo .
i am planning to use hdmi interface mainly .
so what you guys suggest .
wait for some more time and look for thanksgiving deal on yamaha and pioneer or go with sony and end my agonizingly long wait for first ever home theater system .
thanks , well ahead of all the responses .
