what is best for watching hockey ? .
the main use of whatever television i buy will be for bluray/dvd , videogames , sports -lrb- in particular hockey and football ... emphasis on the hockey -rrb- .
my greatest concern is for watching hockey in both hd and sd .
i am looking to upgrade from my 720p/1080i 51 '' projection to either an lcd or plasma .
i am aware of some of the various pitfalls of both technologies ... blurring -lrb- which seems subjective -rrb- , contrast , `` white '' tends to look better on lcd 's where as `` black '' in regards to detail tends to look better on plasma ... both facts explainable by the inherent nature of each respective tech .
if i get an lcd it will be one with 120hz tech , 5:5 pull down -lrb- as opposed to 3:2 -rrb- , a response time of 8ms or better ... etc. . .
etc if i get a plasma ... not sure ... i would like to say kuro , but it 's out of the price range at the moment and i will not buy a panasonic .
so if there is anyone out there who has watched a good amount of hockey on their lcd/plasma over the last year -lrb- in hd and or sd -rrb- , i would appreciate your input .
also if i do get any responses could you let me know what tv you have -lrb- ie : make and model -rrb- .
thanks in advance
