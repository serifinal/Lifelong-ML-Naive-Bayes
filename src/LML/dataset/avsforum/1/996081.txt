pio 5080 vs 5010 vs 5020 .
ive tried finding out my answers throught the general forum but couldnt find what i was looking for .
i have a 5080 , do you think the differnce is significant enough to sell it , get a 5010 or 5020 ?
ive noticed that the 5020 is actually cheaper than the 5010 in most places , but not being able to adjust color is very bothersome .
if anyone switched from a 5080 to a 5010 or a 5020 and can share their impressions , i 'd appreciate it .
thanks .
what are the pros and cons to each ?
