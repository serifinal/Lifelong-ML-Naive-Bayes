should i get the vizio 37 '' or 42 '' lcd tv ?
which one is better ? .
from all i 've read , i know the vizio 37 '' vx37l is a good tv .
the cnet & pc mag and your reviews were all good .
the vizio 42 '' vx42l is $ 148 more at sam 's than the vizio 37 '' .
i have a few questions ?
1 -rrb- is there really enough size difference between a 42 '' & 37 '' tv to justify the price difference ?
2 -rrb- my tv armoire is 42Â 1/2 wide -lrb- with 2 vent/cord holes in the back -rrb- .
the 37 '' vizio measures 36.2 `` w x 26 `` h x 10.4 `` d & the 42 '' measures 40.5 `` w x 28.4 `` h x 9.7 `` d. i can fit the 42 '' but would it be better ventalation wise to get the 37 '' ?
3 -rrb- the 37 '' vizio seems to have better reviews overall than the vizio 42 '' , correct ?
i 'm scared because the cnet review said the 42 '' has a `` green tinge '' and i would be driven nuts by that .
so the 32 '' has better performance , does n't it ?
or does it ?
4 -rrb- i 'm debating between buying from dell -lrb- $ 30 cheaper than sams -rrb- and sams .
i 'm thinking maybe it 's better to buy from sam 's because it 's easier to return to the store , should it be defective .
also , dell does n't give any additional warranty -lrb- neither does sam 's -rrb- .
am i right in thinking that the less shipping and jostling a tv gets , the longer it will last .
so it 's better to buy at the store instead of having one shipped ?
5 -rrb- i 'm going to use it as a monitor with my dell diminsion 3000 -lrb- from 04 ' -rrb- with a vga port for use with tv -lrb- not the one for the monitor , and additional one -rrb- .
the vizio 's do n't come with this cord .
dell provides one for $ 25 .
if i do n't buy from dell , what and from where should i get this cord ?
i 'd like an inexpensive , but good one if possible .
also , my living room is very bright during the day and the window treatments -lrb- even with shades -rrb- still make it bright and ca n't be adjusted to make it darker .
i love them and do n't want to replace them .
would the vizio tv 's work well in brightly lit rooms ?
any other help or advice would be appreciated ... thanks !
