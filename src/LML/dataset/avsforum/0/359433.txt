best htib , have a few hours to decide ... .
ok , i really hate doing this guys , and i am sure i will get alot of crap for it , but oh well .
basically , i am trying to get in on the ebay/paypal/microsoft live deal and i am trying to decide on a htib/receiver and speakers combination within the next few hours , seeing as though the deal expires at midnight .
i have searched through the threads for about 20 minutes and i realize it will be hard for me to make a decision in time without some feedback .
if you guys arent too pissed at me for doing this -lrb- i would probably be pissed at me too -rrb- , i would greatly appreciate a few recommendations on a setup in the $ 500 - $ 700 range .
i will try to look through some more and post what i think might be some decent options .
what i currently have : panasonic th-50ph10uka xbox 360 ps3 -lrb- as blu-ray also -rrb- hd cable box i guess i need a receiver that has at least 3 hdmi inputs then .
thanks so much guys , i greatly appreciate it .
