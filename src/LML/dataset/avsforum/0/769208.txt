mattflix media room attic theater begins construction .
what 's a theater without a logo ?
lol so i love watching movies .
i love it so much i 've decided to bite the bullet and start construction in my attic .
here are the floor plans : this is a low budget build .
i 'm hoping to spend less than $ 4,000 to build the room -lrb- not including electronics -rrb- .
i 'm doing all the work myself so no labor costs will be incurred .
phase i is now complete .
last week i rerouted my air ducts and today i moved the furnace 5 feet to the south -lrb- yes my furnace is in the attic -rrb- .
before moving ducts : after moving ducts : this is looking where is screen will be .
for scale reference the rafters on the roof are 24 '' apart .
here is a lame 3d drawing i did looking at the screen .
notice the 2:35 to 1 ratio ?
i was able to snatch up the mitsubishi hc4900 on sale the last day they offered the $ 500 rebate .
i 'm pretty excited about that !
here it is hooked up in my living room for testing purposes .
here is a list electronics i 'll have up there to start : - mitsubishi hc4900 1080p - sony str-de897 / s 5.1 receiver - playstation 3 - energy act 6 speakers - cable box pretty simple set up , but it will do everything i need it to .
my goal is to have it complete in 2 months .
wish me luck !
