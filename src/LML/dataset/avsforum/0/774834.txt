the chroming rose theater .
well i 've been around here for a while now and finally feel like i can start a small build thread .
this is full basement finish that i knew would take a while so i put my projector up and started watching movies a long time back .
drywalled dimensions are 14 ' 4 '' x ' 17 ' 6 '' .
ceiling height sucks .
here 's what i started with .
replace the window with french doors -lrb- lead to main patio -rrb- and removed the slider all together .
did some vent relocating .
still did n't like how the soffits for the venting would have turned out so i had a custom vent made to the same volume but wider and angled .
i had to frame down a little for the gas pipe so designed the vent to maintain as much ceiling height as possible .
i put the equipment rack right out side the theater doors .
had to move the hot water heater to the other side of the furnace .
it sat like this for lets say awhile .
picked up some solid mahogany exterior doors .
thought these would be decent for sound isolation .
have n't been impressed after doing one little test after drywall went up .
here 's right before drywall went up .
you can see my sump pit in the right front .
i 'm putting in a small stage to get over that .
not sure how i want that yet .
dd 5/8 and gg , caulked around everything , used 4-4 '' airtight can lights and two sconces for lights .
well that 's where i 'm at now .
i need texture so i can start to paint .
