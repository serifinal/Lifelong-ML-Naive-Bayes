cant play the x-files : i want to believe blu ray with powerdvd 8 .
just got the x-files : i want to believe blu ray and its not working with poweredvd 8 ultra .
this happens with or without anydvd hd running in the background .
my drive is the lg h20lk .
i updated poweredvd thinking that would fix the problem but that did not help .
how can i get this to work ?
