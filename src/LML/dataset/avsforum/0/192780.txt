newbie needs some help - opinions polks and what sub ? .
hello , i have my basement walls up with my wires run for the projector and speakers .
i am putting speakers in the wall for front and center speakers , about head high when sitting .
i am putting speaker in the ceiling for the rears and sides .
i plan on buying an onkyo 605 receiver but am not sure about speakers .
i have stumbled on the polk rci series - there are some , what i see as , good deals on amazon for some rc85i rectangle speakers - for front left , center and center , they have some rc80i , round speakers for side and rears .
the rounds are 123 with free shipping and fronts rectangle ones are 224 shipped , both prices per pair .
i am not an audiophile - i just want something that sounds decent and does not cost a lot .
i have no idea on what sub to get .
so please give me some opinions on these speakers and what sub to get that sounds decent but does not cost a bunch .
folks on amazon seem to like them , has anyone here used them ?
thanks kevin
