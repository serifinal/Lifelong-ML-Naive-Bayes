if the southern view is blocked , is it possible to get dish ? .
last time i tried the people at dircttv said i need an unobstructed southern view and they could not add service .
this was a couple years ago .
does dish still require a clear southern view to work ?
is there any way to increase the signal with an amplifier if it is not pointed directly south ?
what is the tallest pole dish can use for hd service ?
