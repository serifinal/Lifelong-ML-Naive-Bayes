please help me with my room acoustics -lrb- pic inside -rrb- .
i dont know a whole lot about proper room acoustics , but im pretty sure mine is not ideal .
i currently have the owens corning basement system , for those of you who are not familiar , the walls are made out of a insulation type material , then covered with cloth .
i know that people put up cloth type materials in there rooms to help with the absorption of sound , but is there a such thing as too much absorbtion ?
-lrb- since my all my walls are cloth and insulation -rrb- it seems like my music is too `` flat '' ??? and not lively enough .
-lrb- movies sound `` ok '' -rrb- my question to you all is , what can i do to help this situation ?
btw , i have your typical cieling tile , i painted it black -lrb- which i know affects the original acoustic qualities of the tile -rrb- but i couldnt stand the amount of light the white tile was reflecting onto my screen .
here is a pic of what im dealing with .
any help would be appreciated .
