help !!
i have less than 12 hours to decide !
:-rrb- .
okay , my first post , and of course , it 's a ` panicked ' one i am having my basement finished currently , and am building a dedicated ht room in a 13wx17l room .
my local audio shop selection is limited , and carry paradigm , b&w , monitor and klipsch primarily , with some angstrom , and other brands .
however , i stumbled upon av123 -lrb- had previously heard about them -rrb- , and was reading up on the rocket 850s and liking what i was hearing , until i noticed that the summer sale ends tomorrow .
oh sheet .
so - anyone who has them , or has heard them care to chime in .
i 'm willing to be impulsive here .
tell me what i should go for in a 7.1 setup .
receiver : no idea .
tbd .
could be a denon 3808 or other .
use of speakers : - movies : 50 % - ps3 : 50 % no music , apart from the movies .
sooooo ... set me up with a 7.1 .
is the following going to impress me -lrb- yes , be subjective -rrb- : - rocket 850s -lrb- fronts -rrb- - rocket rsc200 -lrb- centre -rrb- - rocket rss300 -lrb- sides -rrb- - eventually rocket rs250mkii -lrb- rears -rrb- i 'm in canada , so i 'm going all in on your opinion .
i know you wo n't steer me wrong .
bear in mind too , that i have limited options for ht shops to go and audition stuff .
what i do have access to here though are paradigm -lrb- the monitor 11s are likely in a good price range for me -rrb- , b&w , monitor , energy and klipsch .
thanks in advance .
your opinion is much appreciated .
i 'm pulling your leg a little , but i seriously will purchase these tonight if i feel like i should -lrb- esp .
at that price -rrb- .
