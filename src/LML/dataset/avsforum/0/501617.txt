roxul sound proofing opinion .
i 'm currently finishing a basement in my house , and am planning on putting roxul safe 'n' sound insulation in the ceiling between the joists , to stop the transmission of sound up into the mail floor of the house .
the house is older , and the joists are 2x6 , s -lrb- 16 '' on center -rrb- and i am debating on whether to put in one layer of the roxul stuff or two .
the safe 'n' sound stuff is only 3 '' thick , so i can physically fit .
it 's just a question of the effectiveness of $ 200 worth -lrb- second layer -rrb- of roxul will make a huge difference or not .
the final ceiling will be suspended ceiling tiles .
any thoughts on this ?
will a second layer of this stuff make a huge difference ?
