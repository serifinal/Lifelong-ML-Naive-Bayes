panasonic dmp-bd35 coming , new receiver needed ? .
i 'm awaiting delivery of a new epson home cinema 1080 ub projector and a panasonic dmp-bd35 blu-ray player .
this pm the thought occurred to me that i could just go direct from the blu-ray player to the epson and run the audio from the panasonic into my 8 year old 5.1 nad t770 -rrb- , and save the $ $ $ i 'd spend on a new a/v receiver .
from the panasonic manual , it appears i wo n't get true 1080p ... but it will output 1080i .
whadayathink guys ?
will this work ?
wo n't cost me anything to try of course , except perhaps some extra really long component cables to get from the blu-ray player to the epson -lrb- like 20 ' -rrb- , but if i 'm wasting my time ...
