marcus home cinema .
i 've been spending the better part of the last year looking at everyone else 's amazing theaters on here , so now that i 've finally -lrb- mostly -rrb- completed my first one , i thought i 'd share it .
moved into our new home about a month and a half ago and having a potential theater room was a must .
however , we were n't in the price range to get something fairly new with a basement so i had to turn my attention to lofts and bonus rooms .
ended up settling on this house which has a great mostly closed off 21 ` x16 ' 2nd floor extra family room if you will .
things really worked out perfectly for an already constructed room to allow me to make a decent theater without wires all over the place and give it a look like it was built this way in the first place .
updated equipment list -lrb- pics need updated for speakers -rrb- : equipment mitsubishi hc1500 projector 100 '' elite ezframe cinewhite screen 2 polk monitor 60 fronts and cs2 center 4 polk m3 ii 's surrounds premier acoustic pa-120 12 '' sub jvc rx-412b hdmi receiver 40gb ps3 toshiba a3 hd-dvd xbox 360 nintendo wii grand total = ~ $ 4000 -lrb- that includes everything - custom bar , stools , recessed lighting , wiring , mount , etc -rrb- .
not too bad considering the end result .
speaking of which , here 's some pics .
sorry in advance if the pics are a little blurry , the wife 's camera is n't so great .
here 's the only `` before '' shot i have .
just a plain jane empty white room .
