how should i hook this up yamaha rx-v663 etc. . .
i am getting ready to order this receiver and i 'd like to ask you about hooking up what i have to it .
the only thing i think i need help with is my speakers .
for right now i am going to use my logitech z-560 's with this .
i ca n't afford speakers right this minute so i decided to just use these for now .
for those that do n't know what these are , they are just a 4.1 set .
here 's a link to them .
i just ordered 2 more of the satellites off ebay so i can use one as a center channel .
the problem is , how am i gon na be able to hook the sub up ?
i thought about getting a rca to 3.5 '' adapter and plugging the thing into the receiver that way , but that 's not going to work because of the volume control on these .
it 'd be easy if the yamaha had a built in amp for a sub .
but since it does n't what can i do ?
thanks in advance for any help .
