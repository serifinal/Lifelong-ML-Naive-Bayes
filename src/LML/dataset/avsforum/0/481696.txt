what visual quality should i expect from my blu-ray player on my 720p hdtv ? .
i am pretty much an hd tech novice , but am learning .
a little background info ... within the last year i have purchased the samsung hp-t4254 42 '' plasma tv and i just purchased the samsung bd-p1500 blu-ray player this evening .
i also purchased an hdmi cable to connect the two for best audio/visual quality .
i love , love , love the beautiful picture of my hdtv , especially with sports ... just amazing .
i decided to get the blu-ray player to watch my movies in hd spectacularness as well .
i am currently watching a blu-ray movie in the blu-ray player via the hdmi connection and the colors are beautiful .
the only issue is i feel like i am seeing a bit of visual noise/pixelation .
questions : is this because my hdtv is only 720p ?
what should i expect visually if i have a 720p hdtv and am trying to watch blu-ray movies on it ?
is there anything i can do , any settings i can adjust on my hdtv and/or blu-ray player to rid myself of the visual noise ?
lastly , am i just being too critcal of the visual performance ?
i just feel like when i go into a best buy and see their blu-ray demo setup the picture of the hdtv is noise free .
any insight would be appreciated !!!
