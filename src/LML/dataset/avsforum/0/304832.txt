sony strdg1200 vs strdg2100 vs strda2400es -lrb- no sony bashing needed -rrb- .
i have a 52xbr6 and trying to match a reasonable priced sony hdmi receiver to it ... because i like sony , ok ?
currently i do n't have top of the line speakers , -lrb- cerwin-vega rs series -rrb- that will probably come next ... .
i 've looked at other receivers , yamaha , denon , and pioneer elite at magnolia , yeah they sound great , maybe even better than the sony 's , ok , i get that , but there is more to an hdtv receiver ... and none of those others has a gui osd for under $ 1k , recent posts about denon customer service pushes me away from denon , and the others are just so expensive !
so all three of the sony receivers i mention are under $ 1k , and i think from what i can see that any should work for me .
all have at least 3 hdmi inputs , all have scaling up-conversion using faroudja current prices : str-dg1200 - $ 699 str-dg2100 - $ 700 str-da2400es - $ 799 also under consideration : str-dg1100 - $ 599 str-da3400es - $ 999 i see sony style is carrying the str-dg1200 on the current receiver page , but not the 2100 , is that last years ' model ?
... so i 'm open to some intelligent input on the differences between them , and why i should consider one over the other ?
