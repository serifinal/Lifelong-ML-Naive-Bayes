sound quality vs sound proofing .
ok , so i 'm new at constructing a ht in a basement .
i 've done several basements , but not a ht .
i guess the homeowner has 2 choices ?
sound quality with no soundproofing , or sound quality with soundproofing .
if i construct the interior walls -lrb- not facing concrete -rrb- via staggered , insul .
and double drywall , including double drywall the ceiling - i would be towards having a good sound proofed room and have good sound quality , no ?
but if the homeowner does n't really care too much about soundproofing , how would i construct the room for sound quality ?
not sure if i 'm missing something .
please help .
