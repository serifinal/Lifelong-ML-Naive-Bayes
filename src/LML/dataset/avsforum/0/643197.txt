i know that multi-channel pcm is technically the best solution for blu-rays because it allows full lossless 7.1 sound and it doesn &#8217; t have the &#8220; affects sound mixing &#8221; limitations that bit streaming does .
however , is it also the best solution for gamers ?
currently , you can use optical output with games and that will allow 2 channel pcm from stereo games and dd from games with dd .
you can also allow the soundcard to use dd live to encode everything into dd .
however , that can introduce a quality loss .
you can also use 7.1 channel analog outputs .
however , that will not allow you to use any of the affects in your receiver .
your sound card would have to do all of the surround processing and any bass management .
so would 7.1 channel pcm be ideal for games ?
you could get lossless 2 channel pcm from stereo games and allow your receiver to do the surround processing with pliix or dts-neo .
then for dd,dts,dd-truehd , and dts-ma you could just send the muti-channel pcm straight to the receiver with no quality loss .
finally , if you have a game or movie in multi-channel pcm you could send that to the receiver with no quality loss .
wouldn &#8217; t the new ati 4870 cards be the ideal solution even for the gamers out there ?
it offers lossless audio for every situation and hdmi video for every situation .
man i can &#8217; t wait for the 48xx series to come out !
does nvidia have any multi-channel pcm &#8220; video card &#8221; solutions in the works ?
