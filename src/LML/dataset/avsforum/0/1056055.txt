help with benq projector , please ?? .
hi all first time here . .
hoping someone can help me out .
i have a benq pb6100 projector .
it ` s been great for 3 years , but now i ` m seeing a blue hue all over the projected image , no matter what input source i use .
benq does n`t have any support so i thought i ` d try you guys . .
does anyone know what might cause this ?
-lrb- my bulb has only 900 hrs , incidentally -rrb- i appreciate any help !
:--rrb- thanks , mike nh --------------------
