help w / samsung pn50a550 vs pn50a650 .
hello everyone , i hope i am not going to get killed for posting this but i have to try .
i am currently the owner of a samsung pn50a550 and i like the tv alot but i have alot of glare in my home as its in my somewhat bright living room .
i have the opportunity to get the sammy pn50a650 .
i need help deciding which unit is better .
i have read conflicting reports about both televisions being better .
it is my understanding that the 650 has a better anti glare coating and a diff dnie engine .
but also i read that the 650 is not 3d ready which is confusing to me .
why would they update a tv and take away 3d .
i honestly dont know what that even does .
maybe someone can help clarify this for me .
does the 650 have something new that will replace the 3d aspect .
thanks so much , martin
