master thread for panasonic plasma not turning on .
everyday we see a new thread about panasonic plasma 's not turning on .
if your set fails to turn on and you have a blinking light , post here .
hopefully this will keep all of the info in one place and everybody can stop asking the same question .
if it blinks 7 times , your power supply is shot if it blinks 10 times , a video board went bad .
please also post the size of your set , city it was purchased in , and build on date -lrb- back of your set -rrb- .
