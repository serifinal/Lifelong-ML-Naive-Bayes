canon hg10 & hf100 are same price ... which one do i buy ? .
a lot of people are looking but no one is commenting ... .
both camcorders are the same price on amazon as of today -lrb- 7-17-08 -rrb- and i have been reading myself to death over the past 2 weeks .
i know that there are pros and cons to both models but looking for direction .
the main reason we are looking to buy a new camera is that we have twin boys that are starting to get vocal and roll around .
all the good stuff is about to start and i want to capture it in hd and put it up on my new panasonic 50pz80u the forum helped me pick out .
i assume for now we will be mostly inside so that is the biggest concern as well as clear audio quality .
from what i have read the hg-10 is : hard drive but has moving parts and some potential noise poor audio quality due to mic on top of cam somewhat clunky silver the hf100 is : slightly smaller better audio quality can capture video in 24p & 30p have to buy an additional sd card black looking for help from owners or other potential buyers in the same situation .
any direction would be greatly appreciated ...
