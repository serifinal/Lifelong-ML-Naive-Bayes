little crack in my laminate screen ... .
lol , i just about to finish applying my laminate to a backing and i pushed my hand on an area where there was a board still and i cracked it ... its about 4 inches long i was doing it all myself too , not an easy job to keep it straight .
im probably never going to see it when watching movies but i will know its there everytime my lights are on just annoying ... this stuff is brittle sometimes !!!
next time i will glue the laminate before i cut it so i dont have to be so exact and i wont get in this situation !!
its easy to cut after its on the plywood with my laminate scissors !
live and learn !
can i glue a 2nd piece of laminate over the first one ?
