jeffcs theater construction begins !
thanks to logan .
hello everyone .
the planning has got to come to and end or i will never get this project rolling .
my build is my first attempt but i will be adding all the common elements of most the builds here such as : 1 -rrb- double drywall , green glue and integrity gasket 2 -rrb- hvac 90 degree runs under mdf boxes 3 -rrb- grafik eyes 4 -rrb- 2 rows of seating -lrb- 3 and 5 -rrb- berks and movie seats 5 -rrb- riser 6 -rrb- sand filled stage 7 -rrb- columns 8 -rrb- screen wall with diy 120 ?
at scope screen -lrb- sheerweave -rrb- 9 -rrb- full sound treatments - traps etc. .
-lrb- bpape design -rrb- 10 -rrb- starfield ceiling -lrb- ~ 11x5 -rrb- 11 -rrb- dedicated equipment room with built in dvd storage 12 -rrb- whatever else i may dream up or you all suggest * 12.1 -rrb- lighted marquee and poster frames - indygreg inspired * 12.2 -rrb- second grafik eye -lrb- to date 9 zones -rrb- * 12.3 -rrb- bigs nip and tuft bar front * 12.4 -rrb- snack area - just cause it is a one of a kind !
* 12.5 -rrb- powered masking system * edited the room we just built our new house and i did accommodate for the ht but ??
being a bone head my dimensions are not the greatest ~ 18x16x 9 -lrb- nothing i can do about this at this point &#61516; -rrb- .
here is the back side of the room ??
could have easily made it a few feet deeper errrrrrrr with the at screen puts me very square as shown in the diagram .
note the light blue is and existing soffit and the peach are the planned new ones .
here are some pics of the space equipment room - big mess right now but will be moved to the room?s back false wall .
existing soffit ok fellas chime in if you see something i am setting myself up on and would really appreciate over all comments and suggestions .
and if you are lurking out there logan you are mine !
