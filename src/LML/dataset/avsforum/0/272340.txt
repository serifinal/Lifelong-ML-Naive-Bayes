music on the web .
hello , probably a basic question for all web gurus .
which site has the biggest range of music in lossless format .
is it still itunes or has someone else taken the number 1 spot ?
if its still itunes is much of their collection now available in alac/lossless ?
if i download songs in alac format do i need to worry about drm when ripping cds or copying these to a backup drive etc ?
thanks for any help offered .
sincerely , - dollarman
