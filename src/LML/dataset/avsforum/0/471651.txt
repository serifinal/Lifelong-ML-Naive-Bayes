samsung a550 or sony w4100 .
hi , this is actually my first post even though i have been reading this forum for a long time now .
i finally get my chance to own a 40 inch lcd because i was offered a really good deal between a samsung a550 .
after buying the samsung , i came across another deal for the sony w4100 and now i am wondering if i should return the samsung and get the sony instead .
the sony w4100 will probably be around 200 bucks more than the samsung .
any suggestions are appreciated .
