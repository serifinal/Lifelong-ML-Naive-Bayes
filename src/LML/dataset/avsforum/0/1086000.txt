need help with best setup for th42pz85u and ps3 !!! .
i got a panasonic th42pz85u about a week ago , and a ps3 the other day , so far i like them both but have n't gotten the opportunity to spend alot of time with both nor am able to sit with them and troubleshoot what is the best thing i could do for the best picture , so can anyone help me ?
ok i have at & t uverse hd service , an onkyo 6.1 surround sound system -lrb- receiver has no hdmi -rrb- , and a new ps3 .
- what is the best setting for watching laker games or sports in general ?
- what is the best setting for watching bluray movies on my ps3 either settings from ps3 or tv or both ?
- what is the best setting for watching hd with my at & t uverse ?
- how can i reduce the background drag while watching sports or fast moving images ?
and also graininess in bright images or backgrounds ?
- what can i do to make dark scenes or dark backgrounds look clear and natural ?
- is there any setting to make non hd channels look better or are they always going to look soft and fuzzy ?
- what is the best setting for watching dvd 's ?
since the ps3 and plasma settings are working together , what should i eliminate settings wise for each system for it to look awesome ?
also since my onkyo receiver does n't have an hdmi input , and i want digital sound from both my ps3 and at & t box , how can i use one optical cable running from the tv to the receiver to be able to switch from ps3 to cable box by using the receiver , it only will convert to pro logic and not pure digital .
what do i need to set on my tv or ps3 to make this work ?
and can i play uncompressed digital surround on my current receiver or does hdmi only support linear pcm ?
i hope some of these questions can be answered , and i appreciate any response i can get , thank you .
and if you have any tips please let me know .
