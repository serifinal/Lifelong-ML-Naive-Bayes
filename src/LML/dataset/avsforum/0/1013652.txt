types of fabric to cover rigid fiberglass ? .
is there any rule of thumb to knowing what fabrics will work well for absorbing rather than reflecting sound that can be used to cover fiberglass ?
or is gom or other 100 % at fabrics the only type that wo n't decrease the effectiveness of the fiberglass ?
i 've brought just over a thousand square feet of 2 '' oc703 and need to cover it , so we 're talking about a large amount of fabric .
i also just started noticing comments about formaldehyde and am worried about health issues now considering the type of room my ht is in .
are there any types of fabrics that i can completely wrap the fiberglass in that will trap some/any formaldehyde toxins but still not reflect sound ?
i 've been looking at tricot nylon which is cheap and has a tight weave but stretches -lrb- think spandex -rrb- that i think would seal up fairly well but it 's worthless if it reflects sound since i 've just made a huge investment in this fiberglass .
people also talk a lot about muslin but no one has said if muslin reflects too much and makes the fiberglass pointless .
and of course there is gom or celtic which is at but then we 're talking about a lot of money for the fabric .
for my ht , all 4 walls , floor and ceiling are 8 '' + thick cement -lrb- 16 ` x22 ` x9 ' -rrb- which is why i bought so much insulation .
the plan is to put 1 '' fiberglass on the front wall -lrb- at screen/false wall -rrb- , 6 '' on back wall , 4 '' on the ceiling -lrb- ceiling is coffered with 8 '' wide mdf/crown `` beams '' and 4 ` x4 ' areas of fiberglass -rrb- , and 1 '' on the lower 4 ' of the side walls .
i will also have 34 '' face super chunk bass traps for the front corners .
i 'm not sure if in my environment i am fine with a more reflective fabric ?
my theory is bass is going to be an issue more than mids and highs , so what should i do ?
