if you were me , how would you set this up ... .
ok .
you experts ... you are me .
you got a great deal on the following kit !
panasonic th42pz85 42 '' plasma panasonic bd30 blueray player sony dav-hdx475 1000 watt 5.1 home theater in a box bd30 hdmi to the tv via hdmi was the easy part .
now you have to hook em up for best audio .
option 1 - optical out from bd30 to the sony box in bitstream mode with secondary set to off in the bd30 .
option 2 - optical out from bd30 to the sony box in pcm mode -lrb- default out of the box bd30 setting -rrb- option 3 - hang the sony kit off the optical out on the pz85 and leave the bd30 in pcm mode option 4 - hang the sony kit off the optical out on the pz85 but set the bd30 to bitstream .
curious what others would do in this case .
