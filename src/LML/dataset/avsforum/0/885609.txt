how do i set this up for optimum performance ? .
i have a hitachi 42hds52 42 '' plasma with 2 component outs and 2 hdmi outs .
i am in progress of building my media room/office and need to know the best way to hook the following items up for optimum performance and to also allow me to get the right lengths of cable .
the tv will be wall mounted .
approx 10 feet from there my media closet will sit .
inside it there is a comcast cable box -lrb- if i remember correctly the hdmi on the cable box wasnt the most reliable so i have been using component -rrb- , an xbox 360 -lrb- also using component and using mainly for the media center capabilities -rrb- and a new denon avr788 receiver .
ideally , how would i hook these components together ?
-lrb- meaning , which components to which components and using which types of connections ? -rrb-
