mario kart wii and cheating ? .
i am not one to cheat and never really look into how they do it , but i was curious about a few things .
these are some things i have noticed while playing online : some players seem to be invincible and you ca n't hit them with anything some seem to have an endless supply of mushrooms i have seen a few players just appear out of nowhere , they were n't even in the race to start with , they just appear at the end of the race .
sometimes it seems they either have a banana , or shell permanently stuck behind them to block anything you throw at them .
my wife and i are both pretty good players , but it 's hard to contend with things like that .
it sucks that people have to resort to cheating .
we have unlocked pretty much everything and have received 2 stars on each level in the 50cc ... 100cc and 150cc .
has anyone else encountered these problems , sorry if it 's posted somewhere else and i missed it , i guess i just need to vent ... lol .
