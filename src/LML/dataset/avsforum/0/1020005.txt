want to get a nas and connect it to my pch .
what should i get and how do i do it ? .
i want to get a nas which has at least 2tb of storage , and it will have all of my 1080p/720p videos on it .
so my tv/router setup is the following : living room has my tv/popcorn hour -lrb- pch -rrb- and office has my router .
i will have to use a wireless setup regardless .
where should i put my nas ?
can i put my nas in my living room and connect it via usb to the pch for better speeds ?
i would also use some type of router/bridge to connect the nas wirelessly to my router in my office .
or would a wireless solution be better by putting the nas in the office ?
and streaming the videos off the network ?
what should i do ?
