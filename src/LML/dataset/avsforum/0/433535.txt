simple question for most of you , do i have my components set up correctly ? .
i have the following components for my bedroom : 1 .
pc 2 .
lcd tv 3 .
speakers 4 .
hd dvr this is how i plan on setting it up : just a few questions : 1 .
will i get 5.1 sound if i connect the pc and speakers by a 3.5 - > rca cable ?
2 .
will i get 5.1 sound when i watch 5.1 / hd tv shows if i go with the setup on the top ?
or will i have to connect the hd dvr and speakers with a optical toslink cable ?
3 .
are coaxial audio and optical toslink audio connections basically the same ?
4 .
should i go with the onkyo s3100 for $ 250 or sony ddwg700 for $ 180 ?
the system will be used for my bedroom and i 'd like to keep it with me even after i move out to an apartment where it will be used for the living room .
5 .
i might consider the sony ct100 soundbar , figured i 'd ask here also .
does the sound still good if i stand off to the side of a soundbar or do i have to position myself directly in front of it to get the same quality ?
6 .
what is the hdmi connection good for for audio ?
i thought it 's mainly used for video , why would i having it in a receiver be used for ?
