paradigm monitor v5 vs studio v4 only for ht .
hi , i have some questions regarding the difference between paradigm monitor v5 and studio v4 .
i have the following speakers at front : - paradigm monitor 11 v5 - paradigm centrer cc-390 v5 now , my questions : 1 -rrb- will i see a big difference in sound if i traded them for studio 60 -lrb- v3 or v4 -rrb- and cc-570v3 -lrb- or cc-590v4 -rrb- 2 -rrb- if i decide only to change my center for a cc-570 -lrb- or cc-590 -rrb- does the timbre matching between speakers will still be good ?
please note that i 'm only using those speakers for home theater , not to listen music .
thanks in advance .
ben ps .
