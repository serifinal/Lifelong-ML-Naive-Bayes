-lsb- ger -rsb- kickboxer coming to blu-ray january 09 - .
will definetly be ordering this one .
please be region free - http://www.kino.de/videofilm/kickbox...lm/118474.html apparently there are 2 cuts a us one and a european cut .
they are trying to combine both on the 1 blu-ray so you can choose which one you want to watch on the blu-ray edition .
from another forum - quote : dear mr. xxx , thank you for your email and your suggestions about our dvd releases .
kick boxer : the problem here is still that the two versions have a different format , which is unfortunately not so easy to cut together , otherwise we would have done this long time ago .
we are also film fans and advocate for possibilites uncut versions .
for this reason , there are currently considerations , as part of a bluray release a so-called `` uncut version '' , where a version within the choice given to the other version `` to jump '' .
this possibility of the technically adequate implementation is currently being tested and is in the planning .
yours sincerely , splendid film gmbh
