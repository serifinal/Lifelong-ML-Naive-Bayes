confused over samsung models lnxxaxxx and lntxxxx .
what is the difference in the product lines ?
i 've tried reading about the models but ca n't sort out significant differences .
can anyone tell me what model lntxxxx compares , and how , to an ln40a650 for example ?
also , when i go to samsung on line i ca n't find any lnt models listed .
