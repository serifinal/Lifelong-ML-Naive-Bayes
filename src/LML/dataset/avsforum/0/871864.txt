samung 4095 1080 display issue w/pics .
hey all , i purchased the samsung 4095 40 inch 1080p set about 18 months ago and all was well until about 30 days or so ago i noticed that there was some discoloration present on the screen .
the discoloration appears as a green haze on the screen depending on what is displayed .
it appears to move / sparkle depending what is being displayed .
it also is most noticeable on dark-black screens .
this seemed to be hit or miss for a while and i had a hard time reproducing it .
but time has changed that and now i can get it to display the discoloration most of the time .
it is input independent and i have duplicated over hdmi and coax inputs .
i have attached a few images and was hoping someone could tell me what is up with the display .
it is under extended warranty but i was hoping someone could shed some light on what is up with it .
thanks for the help big ern
