xonar hdav1 .3 availablility .
i think it 's coming soon .
asus usually does n't have a hint of product info until right before the release : http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1=25&l2=150 http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1...55&modelmenu=1 http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1...55&modelmenu=2 no drivers yet though .
any thoughts on when this is pop out of asus ?
has anyone else noticed the added product page ?
i 'm almost certain that by now , the 4000-series ati cards will have only limited lpcm with no pap and so no different than the analog i 'm using now .
