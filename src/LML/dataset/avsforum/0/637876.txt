new ht/media rm : 5.1 or 7.1 question as well .
i just bought my first home , and am turning one of the rooms into a media room/ht/living room .
my current hardware consists of : 6.1 jbl northridge system -lrb- not expensive , but works well for me so far-i play a lot of music on it as well -rrb- sanyo z4 720p 16:9 projector 133 '' da-lite cosmopolitan electrol matte white screen denon 1804 receiver -lrb- this will be replaced with a denon 3808ci in about two days -rrb- xbox 360 sony ns75h dvd player tivohd the room is 14 ' wide and 18.5 ' long with a couch against the back wall -lrb- which puts the viewing distance about right for the screen size -rrb- .
i do n't have hd dvd or bl-ray , and do n't really have any plans to upgrade .
dvd 's upconverted look great at 720p to me , and the majority of my media is streamed off the computer over the 360 or from the tivohd .
as such , with the new receiver coming in , and the lack of real room behind the couch , i 'm wondering if it makes any sense to move to a 7.1 speaker setup , or if i should just do 5.1 well -lrb- since most of my source material will be 5.1 anyhow -rrb- , and use the the amp to run zone 2 into the kitchen .
if i ever do move to hd dvd/blu-ray , i can always reclaim those outputs .
thoughts ?
