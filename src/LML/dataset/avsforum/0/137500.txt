help my layout my basement ht room .
well i have attached a .
pdf file of the rough layout of my basement ... not the best situation for doing a decent ht room , but it is what i have to work with .
as for right now , i am thinking that the only wall to put the ht equipment would be on the wall next to the stairs .
i will have a wall there that is about 7 feet wide to put the equipment .
i am thinking of using wall mounted speakers on either side of the tv , center channel above the tv and the 5.1 rear speakers towards the corner .
sub could go either on one of the side walls or the front wall .
i will run rg6 to both sides , rear and front just in case .
what are your guys opinion on how i could set this up better ?
couch would run against the long wall and possibly on the wall that borders the bathroom .
