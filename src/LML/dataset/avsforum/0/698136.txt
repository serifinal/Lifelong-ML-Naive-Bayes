samsung ln40a630 pc problems .
i bought a samsung ln40a630 primarily as a pc monitor and for use with x360 & ps3 .
its replacing my westinghouse 37w3 which worked as a pc monitor perfectly .
the problem though is that my new samsung looks horrible over hdmi connected to my pc .
its set to 1920x1080 at 60hz , i 've turned off all of the image enhancements available -lrb- dynamic contrast , black levels , edge enhancement , sharpness reduced , etc -rrb- , but it still looks bad .
the color does n't looks washed out and the text does n't look crisp .
the text also looks like it glows .
it almost feels like its not doing a 1:1 pixel map , but instead trying to adjust the image .
its in just scan mode , because in 16:9 mode there is overscan .
any idea what i can try to fix this before i have to return it ?
