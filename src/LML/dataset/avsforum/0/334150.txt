birth of a diy curved screen -lrb- at grey -rrb- .
well after a bunch of research and deliberating i have decided to build a 2.37:1 curved screen .
i researched and researched for grey acoustically transparent material to use but did not find anything that i could use but was set on a hi contrast grey screen with acoustically transparent properties .
i went to the local fabric stores on a quest after a few tries and disappointments i have found something that would work perfectly so i went along with the build .
i plotted out a cad designed top and bottom piece with a 40 ' curve with our company plotter , cut out the shape and then traced it onto wood pieces .
i carefully cut the curve out with a jig saw and then attached a 2-1/4 '' casing to the pieces of wood .
then built a frame around it making sure it was all square .
after that i painted the whole frame flat black .
then came stretching of the fabric and of course at the end , the build and attachment of the frame , which was covered with black velvet material .
the frame is attached with brackets in such a way that it can be taken off if the material needs to be stretched or replaced .
the mounting method of the black frame does not put holes in the material at all .
i have also utilized rare earth magnets fastened in the main frame at the 16:9 and 4:3 locations at the top and bottom so that easy and accurate masking is possible with a snap .
i was not planning to go to motorized masking so this was a quick and simple solution .
i did not take too many photos of the build process but here are some :
