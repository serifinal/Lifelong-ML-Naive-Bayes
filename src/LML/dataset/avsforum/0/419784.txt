samsung pn50a550 vs panasonic 50pz80u .
hi , this is my first post so bare with me .
i searched through the avs threads and there is n't a whole lot of coverage on panasonics more affordable set of 50pz80u .
i know there are polls and user opinions on the 50pz85u compared to the pn50a550 but not on the 80u .
from what i can tell , the 85u has a contrast ratio of 30k :1 compared to that of the 80u 20k :1 .
the 85u also has a vga port but that 's no big deal to me -lrb- using a hdmi to dvi converter -rrb- .
what am i really concerned with is the 10k difference in native contrast ratio found on the 50pz85u/pn50a550 sets .
so with that being said , which is better of two in terms of image quality -lrb- taking into consideration of glare , true blacks , color hues/saturation , etc -rrb- ?
the panasonic 50pz80u or the samsung pn50a550 ??
i originally had my heart set on the samsung but over this memorial weekend , i scored a killer deal on the panasonic in which the price difference is 34 % less than the samsung -lrb- more than enough for me to buy a ps3 plus a wall mount with the same allocation of funds -rrb- .
any help will be appreciated .
cheers ...
