nrc - what does it really mean ? .
here 's a list of materials , with their nrc ratings : http://www.atsacoustics.com/page--se...erial--ac.html i gather nrc has to do with overall sound absorption , and i assume a bigger number is better ?
so why does the 703 have a higer rating than the 705 ?
i thought the 705 was better ?
and is 0.95 overall a good rating for any type of material ?
if so , why would n't i go with the 2.5 lb material at the top -lrb- aside from the rigidity of it -rrb- ?
then there 's this stuff , which has a 1.05 rating , is it better/worse/virtually the same ?
