official samsung lnxxa550 -lrb- series 5 -rrb- owners thread no price talk ! .
these are available now .
samsung series 5 lcd -lrb- 2008 -rrb- hdtvs model numbers : * ln32a550p - 32-inch * ln37a550p - 37-inch * ln40a550p - 40-inch * ln46a550p - 46-inch * ln52a550p - 52-inch -lrb- the above links go to samsung 's support pages which includes manuals and quick start guides for each -rrb- .
something i would like to point out is that the 32 '' and 37 '' models have worse technical specs than the 40 '' , 46 '' , and 52 '' .
a 15,000:1 contrast ratio compared to a 30,000:1 contrast ratio -lrb- and possibly other differences -rrb- .
so even though they are in the same 550 series they are not all the same !
