.
i have been looking at specs and pictures on onkyo 's site as well as popular authorized online dealers .
in almost all cases the text specifies 4/1 hdmi but the pictures show 3/1 .
the world 's largest online book seller says it is in stock and ready to ship so hopefully someone will have one soon to verify what it really is .
