so what 's up with 32 '' tv 's ? .
you 've got the new 32 '' xbr6 , for instance , which is priced like the larger xbr6 's , and yet is 60hz to their 120 hz .
-lrb- i guess in theory they are thinking the smaller sets do n't need 120hz ?
but then they should n't be priced like they do ... ? -rrb- .
then you have the sammy 550 and 630 , but the 630 in larger sizes would be 120hz , right ?
but why buy the 630 over the 550 32 '' if they are both 60hz ?
what are the odds that 120 hz 32 '' sets will be hitting the market soon ?
will this be the new models , out when , christmas time ?
