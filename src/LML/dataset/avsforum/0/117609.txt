how do i set this up ? .
i want to hook up two small bookshelf speakers to my receiver .
the speakers in the garage and the receiver in the living room .
i want the garage speakers to be able to be on without having the living room surround sound on , and vice versa .
can this be done easily ?
what are my options ?
the receiver is a sony model # str-de445 .
