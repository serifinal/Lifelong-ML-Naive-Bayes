cable glitch recording to dvd ?? .
problem : two dvd recorders -lrb- 1 zenith , 1 jvc -rrb- on two branches of the main cable splitter .
both set to record e.g. letterman at 11:30 .
intermittently , * both * stop recording simultaneously after ~ 5 , ~ 20 , ~ 40 minutes .
some days the whole show records .
there 's no external evidence of ac abnormalities .
could this be a problem with the cable feed ?
-lrb- time warner customer support is so far clueless ... -rrb-
