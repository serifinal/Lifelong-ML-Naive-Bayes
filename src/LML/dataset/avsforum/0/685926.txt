what is the lfe used for and how should i set it up ? .
i set all my mains to a 100hz cutoff point , but i have no idea what i should set the lfe to .
i own an onkyo htib system , which offers a more adjustable speaker setup menu .
some i heard let you choose speakers to be set to small , or large and that is all you have to do when it comes to adjusting the frequancies .
i wished it was that easy using my receiver .
