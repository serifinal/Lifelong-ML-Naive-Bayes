the lost boys : the tribe .
`` the lost boys : the tribe '' -lrb- or ` the lost boys 2 ' -rrb- actually was n't as bad i expected it to be .
i 'm a hugh fan of the original `` lost boys '' and i expected tlb2 to be a quicky straight to dvd pos .
to my surprise i found myself enjoying this sequel of vamps with it 's occasional over the top gore and typical 80 's gratuitous naked breasts -lrb- especially the very hot canadian singer moneca delain - bsg fans may recongize her from her small role as ` blonde woman ' in ` battlestar galactica : the miniseries ' -rrb- !
it was fun seeing the return of two of the original cast members ` corey feldman ' as ` edgar frog ' and `` corey haim '' , in a small cameo as ` sam emerson ' ; not to mention the `` sax player '' -lrb- unfortunately jamison newlander 's scenes as alan frog were cut -rrb- .
once tlb2 was over i wanted to pull out my copy of ` the lost boys ' and rewatch it .
worth a rent .
just go into it with low expectations and you may find yourself surprised .
it 's not the best but it 's not the worst i 've ever seen .
if you enjoyed the original and miss the gratuitous naked breasts found in most all 80 's movies then you will enjoy ` the lost boys : the tribe '' .
available in sd or blu ray from netflix , amazon.com , etc. etc
