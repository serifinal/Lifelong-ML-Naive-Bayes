.
hello ok i would really appreciate anyone who can help me with this .
i 've recently changed which tv my xbox 360 elite is connected to , mainly because a room mate of mine moved out and took his tv , a samsung 46 '' lcd , with him .
i now have a toshiba 40 '' lcd , but when i connect my xbox with the hdmi cable i get no audio and instead of hd resolution options i get pc like options -lrb- 640x480 etc. -rrb- .
now i also have a vizio 26 '' lcd , which use to work just fine with my xbox using hdmi connection , but i tried it recently and have the same problem .
at this point i thought something was physically wrong with the xbox , so i decided to take it to my former room mate 's new place and see if i got the same problem .
well i connected it and it worked fine .
so i tried lowering the resolution before i brought it back home , but when i brought it back it still has the same problem .
i have called microsoft several times and got nowhere .
i 've tried the y button & right trigger reset , i 've tried changing hdmi cables , and which port it plugs into .
mind you i have no issues with my component cables , but i really would like to have it connected using hdmi .
is it possible this has something to do with the nxe update ?
please , any help would be greatly appreciated .
thanks
