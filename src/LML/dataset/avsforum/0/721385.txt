why plasma has so high brightness spec 's ? .
several plasmas -lrb- samsung , lg , panny -rrb- claim to have brigthness sepcifications of 1000 cd/m2 to 1500 cd/m2 .
any high-end lcd -lrb- xbr4 , lnxx81f -rrb- has brightness specs of 500 cd/m2 or less .
1 -rrb- has anyone known technical reasons why plasmas can reach so big score , compared with lcd 's ?
2 -rrb- and why plasma pictures ca n't get that bright in real life ?
-lrb- p.s. - i know brightness is not an important factor in pq evaluation -rrb-
