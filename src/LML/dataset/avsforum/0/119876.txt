canon hf11 -- best settings ?? .
i 'm new the this forum and just bought a canon hf11 .
i 've done preliminary tests with it today and am disappointed with the results .
i 'm assuming i must not have the settings set correctly .
can anyone coach me on what settings yield the absolute best results , assuming good lighting conditions .
second , can anyone tell me the best settings when in lower light situations .
i 'm filming my daughters ballet tonight -lrb- which is part of why i bought the camera -rrb- and i have heard that the 24fps setting is actually not as good in low lighting , but i 'm not quite sure what i 'm doing yet .
thanks !
