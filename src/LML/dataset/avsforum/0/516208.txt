best way to create lossless dvd copy for ps3 .
sorry for the cross posting -lrb- i orginally put this in video download services , my mistake -rrb- .
i figure this is probably the right place to ask : i have a friend with a ps3 that would like to rip dvds losslessly to a upnp server for streaming to the ps3 .
i have tried a few things , and every time i get an `` unsupported format '' when playing the video on the ps3 .
if i re-encode to mp4 i can play the movies , but that takes hours and degrades the quality .
hdd space is not a concern .
right now , what i know does not work is ripping into an avi container with the ac3 audio and full res video .
this works fine on my computer , and on my htpc for lossless ripping , but the ps3 does n't seem to be able to handle this kind of file .
i am going to try anydvd to rip the movie -lrb- fully -rrb- to the hdd to see if that will stream to the ps3 correctly , however , i do n't think it supports vob files ?
i want to keep the movie in mpeg2 format ; the supported mpeg2 's for the ps3 are listed as .
ts and .
ps files -lrb- of which only one of them can contain ac3 audio -rrb- .
what is the best way to get from a dvd -lrb- or vobs -rrb- to .
ts or .
ps ?
again , i have everything working ; if i encode to mp4 i have no problems .
however , it takes about 10 mins to losslessly rip a dvd , and about 2 hrs to re-encode it to a format that looks much worse then what i started with .
i really want to stay in the full res/full audio format of the dvd .
thanks for any help you can provide , i really appreciate it !!
