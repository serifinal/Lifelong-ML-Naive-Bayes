ca n't use hdmi and coax digital out at same time ?? .
hi , i need some help trouble shooting why my cable box is n't sending any audio to my stereo receiver via a digital output .
the way i currently have it setup is the the dvd player and cable boxes hdmi inputs go to a hdmi switcher that goes into the tv .
i 'm sending an optical digital out from the dvd player to the receiver , and coax digital out from the cable box to the receiver .
everything works except i 'm unable to get audio from the cable box to my receiver .
i 've also tried just using the coax output on the tv to the receiver and thats not working either .
but the coax output connection works when i connect the dvd player to the receiver .
not quite sure what the issue is , but anyone that knows , i 'd really appreciate it .
also , any more efficient ideas on setup would be great .
thanks !
