camcorder direct to external hard drive ? .
i have a canon hv20 camcorder and i want to be able to transfer the video from my minidv tapes directly to a firewire external hard drive ... this bypassing my computer .
is this possible ?
or what about recording directly to an external hard drive instead of the internal minidv tape ?
