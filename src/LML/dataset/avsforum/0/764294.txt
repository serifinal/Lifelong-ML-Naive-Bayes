samsung 750 clouding thread .
this thread was not originated to bash the tv , as the vast majority of people love their samsung 750 , including myself .
instead , it was designed to give people who are thinking of purchasing , or who have purchased and do n't know how severe their tv 's clouding is compared to other people 's 750s , some heads up so they can make an informed decision .
bottom line , i do have clouding , and this tv would be near perfect if i did not , and although i wish the panel was more uniform , the issue is not a deal breaker for me .
of course , we all have our own opinions as to how much clouding is too much , so let the discussion begin .
but please , in addition to the poll , explain the appearance of your clouding , where it shows up on the panel , and in what types of situatioins does it rear it 's ugly head .
you may choose more than one option , so please vote in regards to the amount of clouding you have , and then to what situations it shows itself .
