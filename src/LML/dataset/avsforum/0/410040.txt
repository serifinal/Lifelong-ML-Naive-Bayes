need some clarification on sharp aquos sets . .
hi everyone , a lot of people here seem really knoweledgeable on lcd sets , and i have after months and months of research settled on the sharp aquos as what i want to get .
i 've heard they do a pretty nice job with sd content , animation , movies and most importantly , video games .
particularly using ps3 and 360 .
ive been leaning at the lc42d64u or the lc46d64u .
ive heard they have pretty much eliminated the banding from these .
is this true , and how will i know if i am getting a newer one without banding .
also is the 65u or 92u better than the 64 series ?
