2 quick questions before the weekend build begins .
hey everyone , i 'm planning on starting my build this weekend .
the father-in-law is coming in for the holiday and while he 's here i 'm planning on abusing him with my room build .
right now i have two questions left that i 'm hoping you guys can help me answer .
1 -rrb- i currently have the insulation batting nailed into the three concrete sides of my basement walls .
i 'm planning on doing a room within a room for my setup and i was wondering if i should pull that down and leave a 1 '' airgap , or should i just butt up my 2x4 stud walls to the backside of those .
i 'm going to fill the studs with r13 , so if i leave it up do i have any mold concerns between the two ?
2 -rrb- i have 2 electrical panels in the room .
currently these are mounted to a piece of plywood which is then mounted to the concrete walls .
should i move these off the plywood and attach them to my studs ?
or can i leave them where they are and frame a box around them ?
this would end up coupling the box to the room and then to the concrete wall which is against rwiar principals .
do i have any code concerns either way ?
-lrb- loudoun county , va -rrb- thanks in advance guys , i 'm looking forward to starting my official build thread after the weekend is over .
