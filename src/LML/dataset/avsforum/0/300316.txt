what is acoustic effect of leaving door to ht open ? .
aside from the obvious sound isolation issues , could anyone report on the acoustic effect of leaving the door to your ht open ?
i 've heard that by leaving the door open , or not having a door to close , you can not `` contain the low frequencies '' which , i was told , will adversely affect sound * quality * -lrb- not just sound * isolation * -rrb- .
we could theorize on the effect of opening your ht to the another normal living area room -lrb- e.g. , an open doorway to another large furnished room would seem to act like big broad range absorber : all sounds that go there would not be reflected by a boundry and so would mostly disappear from the listening room , with perhaps some coming back very diffused and much attentuated , depending on what was in the next room -rrb- .
but could a few people just listen to some soundtracks , music , perhaps with some good bass , with and without their ht door open and report back any differences here ?
thanks .
