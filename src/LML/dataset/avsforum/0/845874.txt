the 2 row 1080p br conversion ht build - finished for now .
thought i take some time to post the final pictures of my bedroom conversion ht project that took around 4 to 5 months .
see build thread for more details : http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1038062 the screen is current 118in with felt wrap foam mask on top and bottom .
screen material is blackout cloth wrap with 1x4 wood wrap in felt .
screen is painted with black widow gray paint mix .
wall artwork are premade ones that can be found at the local blockbuster from 14.99 to 39.99 .
perfect solution for those lazy like me .
all mine are 14.99 ea .
big nice and comfy seats .
they recline too ... basic night light use to light the stair way so the kiddie do n't fall .
riser is 12in with 6in step against wall .
seats are coaster studio like/clone .
very comfy and a bargain at 1k for all 6 .
note the shade toward the back on the 1st step is actually my 12in sub .
want a clean setup , so anything can be place in the front .
also notice that the speaker in the back are black while the rest are silver .
that 's because i only have 5 jbl scs300 sat , so i had to use 2 advent .
for rear surround , the advent works perfectly with the jbl .
curtains are blackout sueue from walmart .
still deciding if i should added another 2 more panel .
projector is mitsubishi hc4900 1080p mounted on monoprice mount .
inside the closet is rack with hd dvd player , htpc , xbox 360 , wii and zenith dvb 318 upconvert dvd player .
the receiver is still the good old onkyo 503 -lrb- future upgrade to the 606 -rrb- .
that 's about it .
i really like to thx everyone that help with getting to this point .
now all we do watch stuff all the time .
