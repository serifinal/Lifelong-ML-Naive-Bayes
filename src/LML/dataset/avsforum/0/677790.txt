outlet hushbox .
well the search was not much help-probably not specific enough .
has anyone built some type of box around their ht outlets to control sound ?
i am thinking that i can build a surrounding box outside the outlet box that is attached to the sheetrock and stud .
i would feed the wire through the hush box and into the outlet , sealing both with putty .
any pictures ?
mdf or sheetrock boxes ?
i could glue sheetrock into a box or mdf .
just using putty alone seems like not enough for a dd/gg wall , but maybe a box is overkill ?
thanks , paul
