samsung is going to replace my plasma .
whats comparable ????? .
so next week a tech is coming out to try and fix my dancing green pixel issue .
the first guy came out , fixed the `` x-board '' and with the hour , it started again .
so today when my wife scheduled the appointment for tech # 2 , she asked how many times a tech has to come out for the same issue before we get a new tv .
i really do not think that anything is going to fix my tv 's issue , so when i call samsung next week and say that i want a replacement , what model should i say i want if i have the fpt-5084 ?
sammy said that we would get a comparable one or the next model bigger .
thanks !
