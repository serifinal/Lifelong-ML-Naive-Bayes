7.1 audio help for a home theater gaming pc and ps3 .
hi , this is all new for me , but i am desperate for help and seeking the expertise of those on this forum .
i have been trying to build a home theater system with a pc and ps3 connected to an hdtv .
it will primarily be used for gaming .
i have ordered all of the parts except for the speaker system .
i am looking for a 7.1 speaker system that can be used for my tv , pc , and ps3 at the same time .
i find the audio-side of things to be very confusing .
from what i understand , uncompressed pcm is what to shoot for .
i want a system that can handle this .
i know a lot of the systems i looked at before only had hdmi pass-thru when it comes to audio .
i did n't know whether it would be best to use the sound from my ati 4870 graphics card or the onboard 7.1 audio .
i figured i could connect from the 4870 using hdmi and still get 7.1 sound .
i have ordered a philips 47pfl7403d/27 .
i have the following computer : cpu : intel ?
core ?
