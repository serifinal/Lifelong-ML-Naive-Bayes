official samsung pn42a450 thread .
so the 50 '' has gotten all the attention with it 's own official thread and i figured our `` little guy '' needed some love too .
as i 've stated , i can not find panel hours in service menu and have just come to the conclusion that it has been removed from this model .
has anyone `` reset factory defaults '' from service menu ?
let 's hear of some settings that our model actually is using and pics -lrb- if possible -rrb- instead of copying `` big brothers '' .
right now i 'm at movie , warm1 , contr 45 , bright 45 , sharp 20 , and all others default , but i have just hit approx over 100 hours and will be readjusting as soon as i put curtains up in bedroom -lrb- tonight or thursday -rrb- .
thoughts on cell light set to 10 as suggested by doug ?
i 'm in unless suggested otherwise .
gamma settings + / - , color settings ?
good luck little buddy !!!!
