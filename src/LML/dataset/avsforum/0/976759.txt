downey jr. `` the dark knight is too smart for me '' .
http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0549397/ in possibly the oddest way possible of promoting the upcoming home release of iron man , downey disses the dark knight plot as being too complicated for him -lrb- and probably many others -rrb- and needing a college education to understand .
weird , weird stuff .
well , he 'll never work for nolan that 's for sure .
