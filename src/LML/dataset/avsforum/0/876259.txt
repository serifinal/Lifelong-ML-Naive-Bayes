line of the bottom of the video at top of screen .
on my plasma tv , for the last few weeks whenever i watch a channel on hd , there 's a line of the bottom of the video/tv show displaying at the top of the screen , just under the black bar .
it was n't like this before , and this only happens on all the hd channels , not the sd ones .
i 'm guessing this is a problem with the feed with shaw cable -lrb- canadian version of comcast -rrb- , not my television .
i 'm using the shaw hdpvr box .
is there any way of fixing this , or do i have to phone a shaw person to come over ?
thanks .
