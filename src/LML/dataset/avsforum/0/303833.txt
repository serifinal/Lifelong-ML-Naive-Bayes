great deal on on-wall speakers .
i was on the emptek website and noticed that they have their ew on-wall speakers on clearance for $ 99 each .
i called and spoke with one of their sales people and he said it was a limited buy and that they are closing out their remainng inventory .
the review on the emptek website is good and i noticed that audioholics gave these speakers a good review .
has anyone heard them ?
thanks odd-e-o
