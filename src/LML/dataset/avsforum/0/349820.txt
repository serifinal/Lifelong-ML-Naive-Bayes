.
okay , so i know there are lots of people who say : bose is a rip-off , and while it may produce good sound , it is overpriced .
but is it true for the bose companion 3 series ii system ?
i would be paying $ 249.99 for 2 speakers and a subwoofer .
with that said , i do n't want to be a sucker .
at the very least , i 'd like to make an educated purchasing decision .
on the other hand , i really am impressed by how bose sounds .
the sound is lush , sharp , and the bass is crisp and not overwhelming .
so in this case , can we reasonably say that for $ 250 , the bose companion 3 series ii system is the best bang for your buck ?
or am i just rationalizing an expensive purchase ?
