arcsoft tmt and mymovies = great !!! .
just want to share with everyone that has vmce and my movies and it thinking of going blu-ray/hd-dvd soon to just do it .
arcsoft made what i have been looking for all along .
i now am streaming my blu-ray movies to two of my other rooms from my server with no problems .
i have been working on the best way for a while now .
at first i used power dvd and mounted the iso 's but it was n't as easy and did n't have the intergraded look i wanted .
then i took out the dvd players and converted my blu-ray movie to .
mkv and used codec?s .
that was a nightmare .
i know some people have had no problems but i did .
today i installed acrsoft tmt and updated with the latest update and everything is running super smooth .
i can stream blu-ray to both rooms at the same time no problem .
as for cpu usage my bedroom htpc has a 2.0 ghz intel dual core with an 8600gt card running at 10-15 % cpu only .
my living room htpc is an amd dual core @ 2.5 ghz with an older 7900gt running about 15-20 % cpu usage .
i am so happy everything is working so great .
i will recommend arcsoft tmt to everybody i know .
hope this helps some of you who were ready to jump ship .
it did for me .
