the x-files : i want to believe -lrb- blu-ray -rrb- official avsforum review .
the review at a glance : -lrb- max score : 5 -rrb- film : extras : audio/video total rating : -lrb- max score : 100 -rrb- 85 studio and year : 20th century fox - 2008 mpaa rating : pg-13 feature running time : 104 minutes genre : sci-fi drama disc format : bd-50 encoding : avc -lrb- mpeg-4 -rrb- video aspect : 2.40:1 resolution : 1080p/24 audio format -lrb- s -rrb- : dts-hd 5.1 master audio , spanish/french dolby digital 5.1 subtitles : english , spanish , korean , mandarin , cantonese starring : david duchovny , gillian anderson , amanda peet , billy connolly , alvin &#8220; xzibit &#8221; joiner directed by : chris carter music by : mark snow written by : frank spotnitz & chris carter region code : a blu-ray disc release date : december 2 , 2008 `` believe again '' film synopsis : david duchovny and gillian anderson re-team to unravel a bizarre case right out of the x-files .
in the blink of an eye , amidst a bone-chilling cold and an eerily deceptive calm , fbi agent monica bannan is mysteriously abducted .
but this is not ordinary kidnapping .
and not only does the search for the missing woman ignite sparks between partners scully -lrb- anderson -rrb- and mulder -lrb- duchovny -rrb- , it defies the boundaries of science , the supernatural and the terrifying spaces in between !
my take : picking up six years after the series ended , fox mulder and dana scully are reunited after leaving their careers at the f.b.i. behind them .
forgotten by their former employer that ignored their unique investigations , the duo is called upon once again after the abduction of an fbi agent .
the fbi is utilizing the services of a psychic -lrb- connolly -rrb- and special agent in charge whitney -lrb- peet -rrb- decides to elicit the aid of mulder because of his successful track record when using psychics during investigations .
she contacts scully , who is a doctor/surgeon now , and asks for her help in locating the reclusive and bitter mulder .
she approaches him and he is agrees only if she will come along .
they accompany the fbi to meet up with the psychic who appears to scully to have dubious intentions based upon his checkered past .
clues slowly begin to unravel the case and the team races against the clock as the hope of finding the missing agent alive are dwindling .
scully and mulder are at odds over the credibility of the psychic and the fact that scully no longer wants to be a part of the life in the fbi that brings them face to face with &#8220; the dark &#8221; .
she has her own battle going on as she has a young patient who is dying from a rare brain disorder which she believes can be reversed with radical stem cell therapy .
the administrators at the hospital don &#8217; t share her belief and she struggles with the politics and self doubt of using such a radical and painful solution that may not work .
there is a common denominator that ties together this case , the psychic , and the disappearance of the fbi agent .
as the case unfolds events transpire to reveal what is occurring and the outcome will test scully &#8217; s faith , mulder &#8217; s belief in the paranormal , and determine the fates of those involved when the truth is discovered in this rather bizarre case.i was sort of an on and off again watcher of the x-files when it was on tv but i was never a true fan .
i liked the premise and the characters but lost interest for whatever reason .
i hadn &#8217; t seen either of the movies prior to this review .
i thought that this film was okay and it was very reminiscent of the tv series .
mulder and scully seemed to pick up where they left off without missing a beat .
i am an amanda peet fan and any chance i get to see her onscreen is fine with me .
she was her usual steely self as the confident and determined special agent whitney .
the problem i saw was that the story wasn &#8217; t clearly focused .
there were several subplots that kind of sort of connected with the main plotline but in the end the connection was never really established which was disappointing .
i didn &#8217; t feel that it dragged and interest was easily maintained over the course of the film .
i think that it represents a nice visit to these characters and the feel of the original show which is something that true fans will appreciate .
parental guide : the rating is for violent and disturbing content and thematic material .
audio/video - by the numbers : reference = 92-100 / excellent = 83-91 / good = 74-82 / average = 65-73 / below average = under 65 ** my audio/video ratings are based upon a comparative made against other high definition media/blu-ray disc .
** -lrb- each rating is worth 4 points with a max of 5 per category -rrb- audio : 84 dynamics : low frequency extension : surround sound presentation : clarity/detail : dialogue reproduction : video : 86 -lrb- each rating is worth 4 points with a max of 5 per category -rrb- resolution/clarity : black level/shadow detail : color reproduction : fleshtones : compression : the x-files &#8211; i want to believe comes to blu-ray disc from fox featuring 1080p avc encoded video that has an average bitrate of 18 mbps and lossless dts-hd 5.1 master audio sound that has an average bitrate of 3.5 mbps .
this was excellent overall presentation that featured consistently resolute images with appreciable fine detail in close ups and mid level camera shots .
the video had a filmic quality with stable sharpness that provided discernible texture and good dimensional depth .
grain was intact and appeared well preserved in even layers with fine visible structure .
blacks were rich with excellent depth that was enhanced when onscreen with mixed content .
the nighttime panning shots of the city skyline looked superb as the deep black of the sky and silhouetted buildings stood out in contrast to the colors and bright lights that traversed the cityscape .
contrast was excellent which provided whites and grays with ample detail and good gradational highlights .
color balance appeared spot on which left them natural looking with perhaps the slightest hint of over saturation in blue .
i thought this worked as it really brought the beautiful ice blue of amanda peet &#8217; s and gillian anderson &#8217; s eyes .
detail in low lighting and dark area &#8217; s was strong .
the film uses lots of dark sequences and its ability to render them with good depth of field is essential .
the foot pursuit sequence that goes into the construction site is a good example .
the staggered lighting and quick camera pans didn &#8217; t detract from the ability to discern visible structure within the dark walls , ceilings and stairwells in the building .
the dts-hd master audio soundtrack delivered supremely focused dialogue that offered definitive vocal description and deep room penetration .
dynamics had potent resolve and defining energy that brought out the potential in the recording &#8217; s elements .
this was highlighted by mark snow &#8217; s music score which sounded excellent .
the entire sound platform was used to reproduce the airy , subtle and sometimes powerfully orchestrated music .
the bass drum &#8217; s driving force was reproduced with palpably rich , low frequency emphasis that occasionally filled the room .
the front three channels competently handled the majority of the soundtrack &#8217; s audio .
channel separation was excellent which gave the presentation nice balance and broad depth .
the surrounds had very good near field presence and provided enriching ambient/directional envelopment when is use .
this mix was well done and certainly enhanced the film &#8217; s experience .

* final thoughts : the x-files is one of the most popular tv shows of all time and has a rather large fan base to prove it .
the series ran for 9 seasons and the x-files &#8211; i want to believe represents its second trip to the big screen .
i thought that this film definitely had the appeal and feel of the tv series but that the story felt a bit too spread out .
that didn &#8217; t keep me from enjoying it and i imagine that fans will as well .
fox has upped the ante with its debut on high definition blu-ray disc .
audio/video quality is excellent , it is loaded with fan alluring special features and blu-ray disc exclusive content that extended beyond the film , and the included digital copy bonus disc allows users to take the movie on the go .
this release represents fox &#8217; s first foray into blu-ray disc live and their implementation looks to be quite interesting .
i could not connect to their bd-live server however i believe it will be operational very soon .
i assume that an update will be required prior to access .
recommended for fans and as a rental for those who are curious .
