		<Content>Did you guys know that Discovery is releasing this at double the price on May 21st? The Image consumer version arrives on 07/29/2008. Are there differences? I doubt anyone knows... Image will present the complete four-episode, 180-minute series on a BD-50 dual-layer disc in 1080p video and Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround audio.</Content>
