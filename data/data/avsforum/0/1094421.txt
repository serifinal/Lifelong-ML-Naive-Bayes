This first set of caps is duplicating my previous choice of frames but all decoded using ffdshow and displaying overlay info now - and finally including the German "Ultimate" Steelbook HD DVD release. This time I'm linking them directly since that seems to be what people prefer. I intend to do more and include the French Blu-ray when it arrives (FR/UK BD disc 1 = FR/UK/AU HD DVD disc 1 but there should be a second disc with the theatrical cut like the FR HD DVD). I'll also post caps of the announced Japanese Blu-ray in this thread once I get that (I believe release date is in December?). I don't have time to do a comprehensive overview (at the moment anyway), so I'm just posting the pics quick so you can all judge for yourselves which release is best and why. PQ/included cut(s)/extras/audio specs/cover art/etc... unfortunately no release has the best of everything yet. The other bitrates have been posted previously, so I'll just say for now that the AVBR of the German VC-1 is 12.01Mbps. (this is my favorite movie) UPDATE Nov 9 2008: Added French Blu-ray release. Specs are here. Disc 1 is unfortunately locked to Region B! And just like the French HD DVD release, if you choose the English audio option, French subtitles are forcibly overlayed. It's a VC-1 encode of the Theatrical Cut at 20.79Mbps. Disc 2 duplicates Optimum's UK release that will also be released in other countries, so I haven't bothered to post identical screencaps of it. Still waiting on the "Premium" 2-disc Japanese that's coming out Dec 5. Too bad that one STILL isn't bothering to use seamless branching. The Special Edition cut is again the main disc - it will be available separately and cheaper than the 2-disc set. UPDATE Jan 13 2008: Added both discs of Japanese Blu-ray release. Specs are here and here.</Content>
