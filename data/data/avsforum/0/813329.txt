		<Content>I've been learning (without much success) to build speakers, and there seems to be a huge difference in design methodologies between various designers. So far, all I've managed to do is get a headache - I still don't understand 80% of the math. Since the folks here are actually using the speakers, I figure you might be able to give me empirical data on how well they work. Partially because I'm cheap, partially because I'm lazy, and mostly because I can't afford it, I'm only going to build a stereo pair of speakers. However, if you have any impressions from either stereo or surround-sound use, please share them. Approach 1: Omnidirectional (or as close as possible) While building a truly omnipolar speaker is possible, it generally requires a high-voltage plasma tweeter, which is more trouble than it is worth. However, with a bit of clever crossover design and good choice of drivers, it is possible to build a speaker that works over 60 degrees off-axis. A good example of this is Sigfried Linkwitz' Pluto. The obvious problem with these is the possibility for undesired acoustic reflection off of walls, requiring lots of messy room treatments. Vertical dispersion is another problem - often, these speakers are completely useless if you're sitting too high or too low. (The Pluto is an exception - it's a very odd design indeed which, by conventional reasoning, should have massive distortion and resonate like a PVC didgeridoo.) Approach 2: Dipoles Examples: Linkwitz Orion++, most other open-baffle speakers Dipole speakers, especially open-baffle, have their own devoted following. Their wide figure-eight dispersion pattern make them desirable in many situations, but because they radiate so much sound backwards that they may have even worse room reflection problems than the wide-dispersion speakers mentioned above. Open-baffles open up a further pandora's box of headaches. I have been told that room placement is critical for these speakers: while the lack of enclosure means no box resonance or internal reflections, it is quite possible for sound to be reflected off of any flat surfaces behind the speaker. Furthermore, even speakers measured 100% flat in an anechoic chamber have been reported to have unusual artifacts in bass reproduction. There is also the issue of bipole and dipole subwoofers: Which is better? Why? Example 3: Bipoles The benefits for bipoles are officially very similar to that of bipoles, which confuses me greatly. Aside from the obvious problems of room reflection above, I would also wonder if there might be some potential issues of phase, especially with the bass. Speaking of bass, both bipole and dipole subwoofers are very popular. Which is better? Why? Example 4: Controlled directivity By using a waveguide or planar tweeter, it is possible to reduce dispersion to a 30-degree cone, outside of which there is almost no sound at all. On one hand, this eliminates almost all problems of room reflection, which is great if you don't want to cover acoustically undesirable objects like windows or doors with acoustic tile. On the other hand, many people report this results in a less "natural" sound. So, what do you think?</Content>
