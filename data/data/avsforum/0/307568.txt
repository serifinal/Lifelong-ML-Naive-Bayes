		<Content>All, Does anyone have dolby digital+ or dolby digital correctly sent via SPDIF to their receivers ? TMT always downgrades to 2 channell sterio for me and only passed 5.1 when I tried using a dvd rip with dolby digital ex on it. What am I missing ? What am I doing wrong ? I have SPDIF selected in the drop down and i have tried both enable mixer and disable mixer. Thanks</Content>
