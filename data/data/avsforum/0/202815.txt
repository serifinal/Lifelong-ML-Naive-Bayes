		<Content>What settings do you use to get the best picture and least lag on your 360,ps3 and i guess wii(i have one but i don't want anyone breaking my lcd screen so i keep it on the crt) hdmi? Vga? Component? i hear vga gets rid of all lag and thus your free to change your picture setting and you aren't forced with game mode ....does vga work on all 3 systems... and if so what settings do you use to optimize your gaming experience</Content>
