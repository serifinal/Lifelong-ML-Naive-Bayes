		<Content>Hi dear all AVS gurus, after tons of researchs on the forum and other websites, finally: I went to the store today trying to get a 42'' Sharp LC42D64U, but it was out of stock > <" , so I ended up getting the 42'' LG 42LG50. (was also considering the Toshiba 42rv530u, but the sales claimed the Samsung or LG is better than Toshiba LCD) And now I just saw the 46'' sharp on sale for about $300 more, just wondering if I should bring the LG back and exchange for the 46'' Sharp? Is the extra 4'' worth the $300 more? some points I have considered based on my study on the forum threads: Sharp LC46D64U: Pros: -10 bit panel -4'' larger -thin bezel around the screen -sleek design, light weight -Picture in Picture??(saw this function is listed on Amazon.com, but didn't see it listed on the spec sheet, could anyone please confirmed??) Cons: -potential banding issue, although the sales claimed it shouldn't be an issue nowadays -2007's model, on sale because it would be discontinued soon -only able to do 24p on certain serial # model LG 42LG50 Pros: -2008's new LG model -able to take 24p -cheaper -Sharp seems to be a more renowned LCD maker, as the 1st generation Sony PSP lcd screen is made by Sharp because no other competitor at the time could make the lcd that well (at least that's what I heard, please correct me if this is wrong..) Cons: -seems to be an 8 bit panel? (could anyone please confirm this as the sales has no idea) -thick bezel around the screen -haven't seen much review on the net on this TV, is it not popular?! So far, I would say the LG is not bad as this is my 1st HDtv, and so anything would look amazing in my eyes :P, but I am leaning more toward the Sharp as it's bigger, thinner, 10 bit panel & has PIP function which would be useful in my family. If anyone could please give me some advice on this, it would be really great, thanks so much ps >>oh, also, if anyone could tell me which one has better picture quality when connecting via dvi-hdmi to computer that would be really helpful! As I would be mainly using the TV as a PC monitor for movies and gaming, and some PS3. So I don't really care about the HDTV/SDTV picture quality.</Content>
