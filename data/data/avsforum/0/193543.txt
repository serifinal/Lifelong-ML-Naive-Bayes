		<Content>Forgive me if this comes off as a "dumb question", but I just recently purchased a Samsung LCD TV. I have a DirecTV HD DVR Box and a PS3 plugged into 2 of the HDMI Ports. I have my Samsung DVD-VR330 plugged into the Component Inputs. Now obviously with this setup I cant record from LIVE TV to a DVD as my DVD Recorder and Satellite are not on the same Input. Is there a splitter that I can use for this situation like the old RF splitters? Or is there any other way to do this? Thanks for any help!</Content>
