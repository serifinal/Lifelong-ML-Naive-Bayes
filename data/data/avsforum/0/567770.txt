		<Content>C1663 is the lovely name I gave the house I designed and am currently building. Here is my story. My wife and I have been house-sitting for the past year or so. Our house is in the process of being built, as we have to move out by the end of July. We will live in the new house for 2-3 years, then build another and rent out the other one. Follow? Being that it will be a rental later on down the road, I didn&#8217;t plan for a dedicated theater/ listening room. The floor plan is relatively open, with the kitchen, living room and dining room all being together. The living room is where the TV/ movie watching and music listening will go on. This will be my first front-project setup. My equipment list is the result of combining a Paradigm 2-channel listening setup with the Klipsch speakers I had for movies. Mix and match. That is why I don&#8217;t list a center channel or surround speakers. At the present, we are using the TV that came with the house. We sold ours and when we move, we won&#8217;t have one at all. (I keep saying &#8220;we&#8221; because my wife is into this almost as much as me.) Here is what I am left with: Harman/Kardon AVR 135 Yamaha DVD-S1800 Paradigm Studio 20 (left and right) No center channel No surround speakers Velodyne F-1500 R 15&#8221; sealed servo subwoofer (oldie but goodie). AppleTV No TV Here is the kicker. I work in the low-voltage home-integration as the bidding manager for lighting control, background audio, home automation and best of all: home theaters. This isn&#8217;t new to me; I just wanted to get opinions from all of the great minds here on AVS. I am open to suggestions and criticism. First, here are some renderings I made of the rooms. Here is a birds-eye view of the room. This shows hallways and a stairwell at the upper right, with a coffee table and area rug in the middle. My work computer is slow and I don&#8217;t see a need for them to be picture-perfect, so no textures for you. This is a perspective view showing the kitchen area at the lower left and dining room table on the right wall by the garage entrance. You may have noticed the 2:35:1 screen. I will use the zoom method. I haven&#8217;t picked a projector yet. I haven&#8217;t set a budget yet. There are a lot of things I haven&#8217;t done yet. I did, however, do the pre-wire myself. The projector location is at 14 feet from the front wall. I ran a conduit to the equipment location at the front of the room. I had the electrician run a romex from the projector location to the equipment location also. This allows me to use the romex as an &#8220;extension cord&#8221; of sorts that way I can plug the projector into a battery backup located at the equipment location. Here is a view of the front wall when seated. I&#8217;m going to use a simple flat panel TV cabinet to hold the equipment. I saw no reason to run the speaker wires to a wall box, so I will just run them on the floor. Here is a view from the kitchen. I moved the cabinets out of view. The subwoofer will be located near field with an option for a second sub on the front wall. One inaccuracy of this drawing is the ceiling. It is really vaulted with the low part on the left wall and high part on the right wall. My wife and I are both musical and want to have a &#8220;live&#8221; room so all floors will be wood. The piano and her harp will be in this room. Thoughts? Comments? Suggestions? There are a lot of things I would like to do, but money will be tight because we have to buy furniture and such. Unless I find a way to integrate a matching Studio 20 center channel, I will likely be buying the Studio CC-690 center channel. We watch very little TV. It is mostly standard-def movies and TV shows. I don&#8217;t have plans for blu-ray yet, but you never know. The S-1800 DVD player upscales to 1080p. The house has been underway for the past 8 weeks, and they will be done mudding the sheetrock by the middle of next week, so I don&#8217;t have a lot of time.</Content>
