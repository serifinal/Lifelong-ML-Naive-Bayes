		<Content>I am going to be starting my basement project in the next few weeks. It will be about 600 total square feet. My plans: I wanted to leave some space for storage, so I am not finishing all of it, and I plan on finishing the bathroom next winter (I live in Wisconsin and refuse to spend any of the 4 months of nice weather we get each year holed up in my basement). I am buying the lumber, drywall, insulation, etc. this weekend and plan to start building in the next few weeks. The theater area will be about 20'x13' and I am planning on having a 10' wide 2.35:1 screen with seating about 13'~14'. I can't afford to get an anamorphic lens, so I think I will just zoom to accommodate 16:9 and use some sort of masking solution. I am thinking about getting the Panasonic ax200u for my projector and using a painted screen, maybe something darker to pump up the contrast because of the brightness to spare in the projector. I am leaning toward buying the Polk RM6750 5.1 speaker package and a cheaper 7.1 hdmi audio capable receiver like the sony str-dg720 or an older onkyo 605. I have a PS3 for my bluray player so I don't need TrueHD or DTS-HDMA decoding. I have about $450~$500 to spend on the audio. I have a couple speakers left over from a panasonic htib I used to have to complete the 7.1 system. Would this be an issue? If the 2 back speakers are not used as much, is it ok if they are not matched to the other 5 as long as they are calibrated correctly? I haven't made any decisions regarding paint or carpet, so any suggestions are appreciated. I am going with a drop ceiling because I want to be able to run wires and have access to any pipes, etc. that are above the ceiling in the future. Also, I think that I will be moving in a few years and I want to have a black ceiling for theater purposes, but then be able to flip the tiles over in order to appear as a normal room when showing the house. Well that is all that I can think of now, I am welcome to all suggestions, questions, criticisms, etc. Better to discover anything I have overlooked now than after I have started and it is too late, so tear it apart and let me know what you think!</Content>
