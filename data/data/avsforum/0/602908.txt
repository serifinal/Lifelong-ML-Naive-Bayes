		<Content>So, this week I'llne building my sonotube and though I'm not against doing a sleek black carpet covering, I might like to do something a little different. Something that might be a good coversation piece as well as a monster sub. I might still just play it safe and do the black carpet on glossy black MDF, but maybe someone will have a better idea..... Another idea I forgot to add to the poll was the lifesaver (like a Lifesavers candy package) Also, if you think its all too strange, tell me to just do black and stop the madness....</Content>
