First impressions: Can notice blacker blacks over 5010. It's hard to tell were the bezel ends with the black bars. Initial start up is set to performance mode. While in the menu. Very slight buzz when you put your head behind the set. Can't hear it in front at all. Haven't try TV or video yet but I will before I start break-in. Update regarding buzz: While running the break-in disc, I do hear a buzz which does change pitch from dark to light screens, light screens higher pitch, but I have to be 2 to 3 feet from the front to hear it and it's the same as my 5010. My DVR box is louder then the buzz. Not the brightest backlite remote I've seen. It's a little hard to see if the room is very dark. I like the menus better then the 5010. I didn't care for the windows xp-ish menus in the 5010. It has a great tool menu that comes up from the bottom during viewing which you can change settings like picture mode and screen size. Here's the post of the picture. http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...4&postcount=10 PRO-111FD/151FD Specs: - High-Definition 1080p Resolution (1920 x 1080p) - 50&#8221;/60" Diagonal Class / 16:9 Wide-Screen Aspect Ratio - 1080 Progressive Image Reproduction with ability to accept 480i / 480p / 720p / 1080i / and TRUE 1080p 24fps signals - New Deeper, Intense Blacks for Unmatched Contrast (5x Previous Generation) - New Thinner Cosmetic Design with &#8250;&#8250;Elegant Acrylic Bezel - New, Improved Optimum Mode.
