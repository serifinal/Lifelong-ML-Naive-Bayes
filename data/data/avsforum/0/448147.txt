		<Content>I Downloaded the sw kit. I unzipped the sw kit. I first installed Avisynth. With the Avisynth in the sw kit you don't need to replace the avisynth.dll as shown in the video. Then I install ffdshow. During the install of ffdshow there is a page that's called "Select Additional tasks", I check these boxes besides what's already checked: mpeg2: libmpeg2 vc1: wmv9 raw video Then after ffdshow is installed there is a final page that says "Run ffdshow video decoder configuration", so I check that box then press Finish. Now ffdshow video decoder configuration pops up, here is how I set it up. From the codecs tab I scroll down to mpeg2 and highlight it and check the "dvd decoding" box, then I click apply. From the Decoder Options tab I uncheck the "Detect soft telecine and average frame durations" box, then I click apply. Then I scroll down the check boxes until I see the Subtitles check box, and I click it with my mouse and hold down the mouse button and drag the subtitles check box to the top of the list, so it's right below Decoder Options. Then I go through every list in subtitles and make sure every box is unchecked, so the subtitles checkbox has all the boxes unchecked, the titles sub list has all the boxes unchecked, then I press apply. Then I drag the avisynth check box so it's right below the subtitles check box, and I check the avisynth checkbox and uncheck these boxes in the avisynth tab: "add ffdshow video source" "yuy2" "rgb24" "rgb32" Still in the avisynth tab, I check the Buffers back/ahead box and leave the values at 10 10. Then I check and drag the resize & aspect check box so it's below the avisynth check box, and this is how I setup the ffdshow resize & aspect check box: I check the Multiply by circle and set it to the value of 1.000 I check the "No Aspect ratio correction" circle, then I click Apply. Then I scroll down to the Output tab and uncheck these boxes: "yuy2" "yvyu" "uyvy" "rgb32" "rgb24" "rgb16" "rgb15" "High quality yv12 to rgb conversion" "select closest matching colorspace" I leave the YV12 check box checked, then I press Apply and OK to close the ffdshow video decoder configuration. Third, I install Matroskasplitter. Fourth I unzip mpc-hc and put it on my desktop. Fifth, in Windows 7, I open windsfiltertweaker and go to the Preferred decoders tab and the 32 bit decoders to use ffdshow, specifically these decoders: h.264 xvid divx mp4v vc-1 mpeg-2 Then I click Apply and Close. Then I check the tweaks tab and disable the "Microsoft dtv-dvd video decoder", then I click apply, close and then exit. Sixth, I unzip the plugins folder and go to this folder C:\Windows\SysWOW64 to put the fftw3.dll. Then I drag and drop the other dll&#8217;s into that folder and accept when it asks if I want to modify those dll's into the C:\Program Files (x86)\AviSynth 2.5\plugins folder. You can tell it's the right folder because Directshowsource.dll is in that folder. For non-64 bit windows you would put the fftw3.dll into the C:\WINDOWS\system32 folder, and the other plugins go into the C:\Program Files\AviSynth 2.5\plugins folder where directshowsource.dll is. Seventh, I open media player classic home cinema player, and go to the "View, Options, Output" tab and check vmr9 windowed. Then I go to the "view, Options, External filters tab" and check the Add filter box, and add "ffdshow video decoder", that set ffdshow video decoder to "Prefer", Click Apply and Ok to close the options box. Then I go to "view, options, internal filter" and check every box. Reboot and then put a movie in the computer and then open the movie with mpc-hc using the file tab and go to the dvd drive to open the movie. ___________________________________________ video guide at youtube link. sw kit.
