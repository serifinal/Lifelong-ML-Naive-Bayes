		<Content>EDIT for HT intro screen shot on 2/26/10 On the advice of many on this forum, I&#8217;ve decided to start a thread to track my progress and document the experiences as I build a small home theater. As a professed novice I haven&#8217;t mastered many of the skills required to &#8220;build&#8221; a really nice room, but I&#8217;m giving it my best effort. Which means I spend a lot of time just staring at the walls. Here is a Sketchup drawing of what I plan to do: From the rear wall to the screen the HT room is about 18.5&#8217; long. It is 11&#8217; wide for about 8&#8217; from the screen wall and widens to 13.5&#8217; at the seating area. The ceiling is 8 feet. I'll place the equipment rack underneath the stairs and I&#8217;ll access it from behind the seating area. The room is below the children&#8217;s bedrooms so sound isolation is my primary concern. In fact, I plan to use as much of my current equipment as possible and use the majority of my budget for isolation and acoustics. I plan to use Dri-Core for the subfloor and to stagger stud one wall (the rest are concrete, all will be DD+GG) and decouple the ceiling with (RSIC, DD, GG). I also plan to use Integrity Gasket. I&#8217;m planning two rows with a riser for seating. The first row will be about 10.5&#8217; from the screen and the second row will be 16.5&#8217;. Based on seating and room dimensions, I&#8217;m tentatively planning for a 110&#8221;-115&#8221; wide scope screen. I plan to use a Grafik Eye (3106 or QS) for lighting control. Other than research and planning, the only tasks we&#8217;ve completed are to clear out the room, secure a building permit, HVAC rough in and recently, electrical rough in, so this thread is beginning at the&#8230;beginning. We started out wanting to clean up the front wall of our current family room set up, but after many months of research, we decided to go with a dedicated room. The room will be in the basement. A few calls for estimates to general contractors only stoked my already burning desire to DIY. I wanted to thank all the people who have inspired me to act on my desire for a home theater by detailing their own experiences. I really appreciate the advice from those that have responded to my questions and posts. Oh yeah, the name of our theater is Lewis Family Cinema. It is a very fitting name given the tremendous involvement and support from everyone. EDIT for INDEX on 09/03/09 Even with all of the pictures, my thread isn&#8217;t that large, but I decided to add an index and details section to make it easier to search the pics and read. Thanks to chinadog, jamis, oman, guam and queendvd for the idea. I hope it&#8217;s helpful. INDEX &#8211; last edited on 2/26/10 1. Building Permit, HVAC and Electric Rough In 2.
