		<Content>I got a Panasonic th42pz85u about a week ago, and a ps3 the other day, so far I like them both but haven't gotten the opportunity to spend alot of time with both nor am able to sit with them and troubleshoot what is the best thing I could do for the best picture, so can anyone help me ? ok I have at&t uverse hd service, an onkyo 6.1 surround sound system(receiver has no hdmi), and a new ps3. -what is the best setting for watching laker games or sports in general? -what is the best setting for watching bluray movies on my ps3 either settings from ps3 or tv or both? -what is the best setting for watching HD with my at&t uverse ? -how can I reduce the background drag while watching sports or fast moving images? and also graininess in bright images or backgrounds? -what can I do to make dark scenes or dark backgrounds look clear and natural? -is there any setting to make non HD channels look better or are they always going to look soft and fuzzy? -what is the best setting for watching dvd's? since the ps3 and plasma settings are working together, what should i eliminate settings wise for each system for it to look awesome? also since my onkyo receiver doesn't have an hdmi input, and I want digital sound from both my ps3 and at&t box , how can I use one optical cable running from the TV to the receiver to be able to switch from ps3 to cable box by using the receiver, it only will convert to pro logic and not pure digital. what do I need to set on my tv or ps3 to make this work? and can I play uncompressed digital surround on my current receiver or does hdmi only support linear pcm? I hope some of these questions can be answered, and I appreciate any response I can get, thank you. and if you have any tips please let me know.</Content>
