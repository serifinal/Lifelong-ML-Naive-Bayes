		<Content>I am considering redesigning my riser and that would require me to place a conduit in the existing basement concrete. The max run would be 8-10 feet. Has anyone done this, if so do you have any tips? I have tried searching the forum, but after reading for 35 minutes, I did not see anything applicable. Help me gurus... help me.</Content>
