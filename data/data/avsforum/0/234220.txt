		<Content>Ok, so there might not be anything "Max" about it, but that's the name we came up with for our new dedicated HT in the basement. We have been planning on finishing our theater for a while now...last year, 5 weeks before Christmas we embarked on finishing a guest "suite" in a mad rush to have it ready one week before Christmas for my parents to stay in. Worked our butts off and actually got it done. So, one of the walls for the room was also one of the walls that would eventually be our theater. Fast forward to this last October...I got laid off (bummer). Have been searching for a job and not finding much out there. So after Thanksgiving I decided to start the HT project to keep my mind off of my new employment status. Now to the good stuff The room is fairly small compared to most around here. It is 10.5' wide and 20' long. There are no windows whatsoever in the space we created for the theater, but there is also no back wall to enclose the space. Here are some pictures. (I hope) Walls are up and I am starting to build soffets. Some fun pipes to build around... One side of the soffets done. Most of the soffets done at this point. Insulation added. Here you can see some of the wiring that I did (no conduit...D'oh). Just about ready for Drywall. Got the drywall hung yesterday! 12/26 Ready for taping! We were hoping to host a New Years Eve party and to use the Theater, but we will probably fall just short of that happening. Oh well. Don't want to rush it... More pics to come once I get some texture on. Todd</Content>
