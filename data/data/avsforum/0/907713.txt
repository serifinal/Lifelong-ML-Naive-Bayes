		<Content>Before I begin, I would like to thank everyone on this forum who has helped with my questions, and given me advice both publicly and through PM. I am sure I will have many more before this build is complete. For those of you who get offended by construction threads that include areas of the basement/home outside of the dedicated theater, I apologize ahead of time because this thread will do that. I will be building my HT literally from the ground up as I build my new home, and it just seems natural to include other parts of the build as well as the HT, but I promise to keep the majority of the focus on the HT as I get to that point. I think the thing I most enjoy on this forum are the "before and after" photos that are posted showing how the talented people of this forum transformed a dreary basement or attic into an incredible showpiece of an HT, and I am actually a bit envious of those of you that have been able to do that, but I will use my pre-build photos as my "before" and feel a little better. As background, for those who do not yet know, I am a contractor and have worked in the construction industry for many years. I will be doing a large amount of the work with the help of people that work with me on a daily basis, and because I build for a living I am confused as to whether or not this still qualifies as a DIY project. Since I am heading into uncharted waters with the theater portion of the home, and I am doing all of the planning, and installation without the assistance of someone who specializes in theaters, then I am going to say it does qualify as DIY. Lastly, I love the theater names that everyone has come up with and would appreciate any suggestions or ideas that you may think of along the way. When it comes to that type of creativity, I simply do not have it. I could do something that plays on my last name (Funston) since it has the word fun in it, but I thought I would see if anybody else has any suggestions before I do that. Thanks again for everyones input and help. I am very excited about HT portion of the build and I can not wait to get into the new house and enjoy the show. I was asked to add a construction timeline with projected dates and actual dates, so here it is:</Content>
