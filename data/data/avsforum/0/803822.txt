		<Content>I got a couple requests for an owners thread, so thats why im starting this one. Most of you who have been follwing the other thread on these know that I have had mine since Tuesday and love it. I would recommend anyone interested in one to go to a big bix store and try it out for the 30 days. I really like the color, but its a personal preference. I think the amp has been toned down a bit but it seems to be working nicely. I mentioned last night I was able to watch Lost last night without any stutter or judder( I still dont really know the difference) where as i could never watch that show with any amp with my 69. Give it a shot and you will enjoy! --------------------------------------------------- May 14 2008 Update: A New firmware has been put out for this set. ver 2001.3 Click on the link to see what it does http://www.samsung.com/us/support/do...sp_nm=LN46A650 May 3 2008 Update: FIRMWARE UPGRADES The LNxxA650 LCD series had a flaw in the first run production units that caused the TV to turn off & on sporadically. Samsung released firmware 1003.G after a few weeks of the TV's release to fix this. The firmware not only fixed the reset problem, but also increased the strength of the Auto Motion Plus feature, but it had a bug that caused the AMP to be stuck & not be turned off when set to off. The current firmware, 1003.M, was released 3 or so days afterthe 1003.G firmware. The new firmware fixed the reset problem & the stuck AMP bug, but also toned down the AMP strength to previous levels. The current 1003.M firmware can be found at: http://www.mediafire.com/?jexhkgj2uhl The previous firmware 1003.G. can be found at: http://www.mediafire.com/?4d5lz449etu ____________________________________________________________ __________________________ BUGS & KNOWN PROBLEMS There are currently two know bugs still present with the TV. A audio bug where if you mute the sound & have it being run through a receiver or headphones, the sound will un-mute itself. More posts talking about the audio bug can be found here: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...postcount=5016 http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...postcount=2743 http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...postcount=6267 http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...postcount=6727 There is also a bug where selecting a 1080p resolution over component will cause frequent dropouts, selecting any resolution other than 1080p will fix this. The component dropout have also been confirmed to be on the Samsung LNxxA650 DLP series as well. There have also been some reports of the stand of the TV being loose & wobbly. ____________________________________________________________ __________________________ PURPLE HAZE There have been reports that some models of this TV have a purple haze to them. There has been no correlation on which models have this. There have been rumors that the haze may be from anti-reflective coating, but nothing has been proven. The haze seems to be a isolated incident with few owners reporting it in. The haze some have reported might also be from off-axis vertical viewing & not off axis horizontal viewing, as the vertical viewing angles seem to not be as good as Samsungs previous 71f LCD. Pictures of the purple haze: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...postcount=6957 http://img134.imageshack.us/img134/5...0135160za9.jpg http://img134.imageshack.us/img134/5...0135160za9.jpg http://img134.imageshack.us/img134/5...0135160za9.jpg Here is a picture of the German model with the purple haze: http://i28.tinypic.com/hrwom1.png Here is a off axis vertical picture showing the purple haze: Here is some information on dialing down the purple haze: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...postcount=7265 The majority of owners have claimed to not have this haze at all. Here are some picture of off angle viewing with no purple haze: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...postcount=7134 http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...postcount=7135 ____________________________________________________________ __________________________ AUTO MOTION PLUS The strength of the AMP by default is toned down from than the previous version in the Samsung xx71f series LCD, but it can be upped to the same levels by going into the service menu: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...postcount=5192 Quote: Originally Posted by RiVoLT For those that need to juice up AMP - FYI - I take no responsibility this is easy but it is at your own risk. Do not mess with settings that you are unsure of. To increase AMP in the SM what you need to do is: 1. Turn off the TV 2. Press 'Mute' '1' '8' '2' 'Power' 3. The TV will start and you will be in the SM (give it a few extra seconds). NOTICE: On this screen you will see an 'FRCM_Option' that is greyed out. ALSO take note of the 'View Log' option - you will need this in the end. 4. The first item is 'Optionbyte' go into that menu. 5. There will be an 'FRCM Option' 6. Click and set it to ON 7. Hit Return (maybe hit it 2x) to go back to the main menu 8. Now you will notice that the FRCM_Option is not greyed out. 9. Go into the 'FRCM_Option' menu 10. You will see Film_Low - Film_Medi - Film_High listed 4 times each. (SD or HD and 22 and 32) 11. To change say AMP 'High' setting change ALL FOUR Film_High options 12. Remember that '32' is off and '0' is full blast. I assume you are looking to make all four Film_High_?D_#2 options to '0' instead of 10 (default in 1003.M) 13. Once the changes are made hit return to go back to main menu. 14. Go back to OptionByte and turn off the 'FRCM Option' 15. Go back to the Main SM menu and you will see FRCM_Option greyed out again. 16. Go to the 'View Log' option and choose 'Delete Log' 17. Press the 'Right' corner of the 'wheel' on the remote or just right direction on another universal remote. The word 'OK' should appear to confirm that its deleted. 18. Go back and select 'View Log' instead of 'Delete Log' and it should say 'Log does not exist!!' 19. Now that you've 'covered your tracks'. You can hit 'Power' to turn off the tv and then turn it back on and magically your 'AMP' will be 'Juiced up'. 20. Enjoy! . Increasing the strength can cause more motion artifacts & Samsung states that going into the service menu will void your warranty. ____________________________________________________________ __________________________ SERVICE MENU In case you need to know what the original values of the service menu were, RiVoLT took pictures of the service menus in all three firmwares available: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...postcount=4816 SM Screens for 1002.3 (~35MB) SM Screens for 1003.G (~35MB) SM Screens for 1003.M (~35MB) His observations of the differences between the three firmware changes: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...postcount=4828 It is also possible to reset all the settings back to what they were when you bought the TV if for whatever reason you need to. Znutz had posted how to perform a factory reset: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...postcount=7134 Quote: Originally Posted by znutz A. Factory Reset[/b] 1. Turn off the TV 2. Press 'Mute' '1' '8' '2' 'Power' 3. The TV will start and you will be in the SM (give it a few extra seconds). 4. Select Optionbyte 5. Select Factory Reset twice ____________________________________________________________ __________________________ TOUCH OF RED & GLOSSY SCREEN The LNxxA650 has a dark crimson colored bezel, that can be seen in extreme lighting conditions, here are some pictures that show the crimson: http://www.fuelslut.net/ihost/files/17006/TVBlack2.JPG Samsung also announced that there would be multi colors of the bezels for the A650 series during CES, but there has been absolutely no information of any new colors being available anytime soon: The LNxxA650 also has a glossy screen, which is said to have slightly better anti-reflective coating over the previous Samsung 71f LCD series. Here are some comparison pictures of the matted Samsung LNxxA550 LCD vs. the glossy LNxxA650 LCD (thanks to the A550 thread): http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/attac...3&d=1206562261 ____________________________________________________________ __________________________ UPSCALER The A650 has a very good upscaler, vastly superior to the previous ones Samsung & most other LCD makers has used: Some pics of shadow hearts running at 480i: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...postcount=6592 ____________________________________________________________ __________________________ BACKLIGHT CLOUDING/MURA/FLASHLIGHTS Some owners have complained that their sets have flashlight on the corners of the TV: http://i26.tinypic.com/2ccmipd.jpg or some backlight clouding/bleed/mura (example): http://i29.tinypic.com/2zi7oqp.jpg Here is the official LNxxA650 thread for Clouding & flashlights: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1018338 Here is a tip to try AND remove or lessen the problems: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...78&postcount=6 The official Sony backlight thread can be viewed here: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=748779 The thread has nearly 9,000 posts about backlight bleeding about the Sony XBR2/3 series, but the discussion can be applied to any LCD. ____________________________________________________________ __________________________ CONTRAST & RESPONSE TIME NUMBERS The Samsung LNxxA650 series has a quoted dynamic contrast of 50,000:1, but Podol, a Korean ISF calibrator that did a review of this set came up with different numbers: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...9&postcount=61 Quote: Originally Posted by Podol Regarding contrast ratio, 71F's dynamic CR's are better in my measurement. But A650 is better in panel's static CR with turning off any dynamic backlight control. 71F(Korean Model# F81BD)'s Max CR measured 27525:1(even better than Samsung's own 25000:1 spec) and then blacks read 0.012 nits that time. That's close to Pioneer Kuro's blacks(0.013 cd/m? initially, 0.006 cd/m? after few seconds) On the other hands, A650's max dynamic CR is limited to around 10K to 1, still better static CR than 71F. Most new TV's from any major brand, IMO, have enough blacks and CR's unless you're watching it in a darkened room A650 has around 2000 to 1 non-dynamic, static CR.(2291 : 1 for my measurement) And that's pretty good enough and better than 71F, I think. I assume Samsung changed their dynamic backlight control algorithm less aggressively this time and that's why 71F has more CR. But A650's panels static CR's higher than 71F. The TV is quoted to have a response time of 4ms. How that figures into real numbers has not been tested yet, but as a indication hometheatermag.com tested Samsung's previous 120hz model with 8ms. response time & they came up with 600 lines motion resolution. http://hometheatermag.com/images/arc...8hdtest.5b.jpg ____________________________________________________________ __________________________ CALIBRATION The Offical Samsung LNxxA650 Calibration thread is here: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showt...9#post13515899 cNet calibration for this TV is here: http://help.cnet.com/9602-12576_39-0...sageID=2510694 ____________________________________________________________ __________________________ REVIEWS cNet review of the LN 52A650 is here: http://reviews.cnet.com/flat-panel-t...7.html?tag=tpr Podol's Korean review is here (translated by google): http://www.google.com/translate?u=ht...&hl=en&ie=UTF8 A Youtube video review can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBAXH9LvX74 ____________________________________________________________ __________________________ INPUT LAG & AMP MOTION ARTIFACTS borf posted numbers on input lag on his Samsung's xx69f 120hz LCD series here: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=960548 All that information can be applied to the xxA650 series as well. The only difference is that Game mode on these sets seem to really reduce input lag. INFORMATION & PICTURES OF MOTION INTERPOLATION ARTIFACTS http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...&postcount=342 All these can be applied to the A650, except the stutter which seems to have been reduced greatly. ____________________________________________________________ __________________________ INSIDE THE PANEL Mikl1984 has posted info & picturs on the actual panel inside the frame: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...&postcount=142 http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...&postcount=173 http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...&postcount=590 THE GAMERS INPUT LAG THREAD Samsung LNxxA650 Gamer's (Input Lag) Thread http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1110472 FYI Big River is a codename for Amazon.com people invented here, so quit asking.[/quote][/quote][/quote]</Content>
