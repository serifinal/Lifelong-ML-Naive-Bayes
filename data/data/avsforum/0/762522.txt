		<Content>After more than the usual pain and suffering, I'm relieved to finally be able to present my finished theater (definitely not a "standard" AVS theater). (stitch of 3 pics): Room Dimensions: (16' W) x (17' L) x (12' H) Screen: 108" SMX material, diy aluminum/wood frame (16:9) Eyes to Screen Distance: 10' Uncommon features:Ceiling hanging "bass trap" panels with can lights, no drywall penetration! Area rug permanently installed as carpet (already had it, saved on material cost) I wanted my theater to be close to a "padded batcave" theater which normally means 100% black everything and full acoustic treatments. But I wanted some color, and already had burgundy Berkline 090 seats, so I used some dark red fabric for accent. The end result is dark enough that it's extremely difficult to photograph. The photos below used 1000W halogen lights, and/or a high powered flash. Under normal light, the different black fabrics are the same shade and you can't see through the grill cloth fabric. Fabrics used: GOM FR701-2100 408-Black (screenwall + soffits + ceiling panels) GOM Zirconia-3583 012-Garnet (wall accents + columns) Dazian Celtic Cloth-Black (walls) Parts Express Grill Cloth-Black (front main + column surround speakers) Started the design process with Design Cinema Privee (DCP) Oct. 2005, received final drawings Feb. 2006 (yes, 16 weeks). Started demo and construction. Made quick progress for a few months, finishing framing, drywall, HVAC, soffits, etc. In Aug. 2006, finished the 2x10 stage frame. When moving it into position, it slipped out of my grip and dropped onto my big toe, shattering the bone. 3 months to recover plus several more months before interested in seriously working on theater again. Lesson learned: never do any heavy work without wearing steel-toe shoes. Finally reached carpet install Feb. 2008! Typical story: installed equipment, chairs, etc. and began using it. Last 2% not finished until June 2008. 60+ construction photos below show the long journey. --Dan</Content>
