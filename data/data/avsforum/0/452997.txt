		<Content>IMPORTANT: Please note, that I no longer have access to the firmware files of the older Onkyo AVRs. Those download links have expired also, because most of them were not used for more than a month and thus their contents have been deleted. Sorry ! ...for the Onkyo xx5 / xx6 and / Integra x.8 / x.9 model series. OK, here they are... ...expanded and updated once in a while Remember: I found those links on the internet just by doing some (intelligent ) searching and pure luck (as always). I am not in any way responsible for the contents those publicly available links point to. I am just a scout I do not have or host those files myself, so please don't PM me about it. Unfortunately I won't be able to help, if they are no longer available. Note: There is always a risk to be considered and evaluated, that something might (and eventually will) go wrong during a software / firmware update. Think twice, if You will take the risk off doing it on Your own instead of taking it to an Onkyo / Integra service point. By downloading any files listed here You accept and declare explicitly, that You accept the responsibility for Your action. IF You have any questions regarding the functionality of Your Onkyo AVR (xx5) there is a very complete listing in the 1st post of this thread =============> 705 thread FAQ 1st post Although it was originally directed towards the 705 it has a lot more to present now, providing answers in terms of general advice, like help for lip sync issues, Audyssey setup and common user mistakes to be avoided.

Again ! You won't be able to use them in any way if You don't have a) the needed programming (flash writer interface "jig" or "dongle", serial connection available) equipment b) the expert knowledge to use it Unless so, don't even *think* of using them in any way. !!! DO NOT USE THEM !!! DO NOT EVEN TRY !!! You will be left with an non-functional unit afterwords and any repairs and additional cost have to be paid by You, because they are not covered by the manufacturers warranty in any way ! They will void Your warranty ! Be warned. Links to a post from user "vxs3tu" describing a generic flash writer interface for the TX-SR805 which might be used as a template for other models Flash writer interface for TX-SR805 Some further information referring to the flash writer hardware and those different adapters needed for main / hdmi / video is contained in those firmware files listed above too. All-in package xx5: Thanks to a user a complete all-in package with all the tools and instructions needed for the Onkyo xx5 models has been created and can be downloaded here: => Onkyo xx5 All-In Update Package Updated 12th Nov 08! => NEW Onkyo xx5 All-In Update Package Updated 27th July 09! => 128 MB ! Enjoy ! Update Yourself using a flash writer (jig) or dongle: If You are one of the unlucky "early adopters" or a member of the so-calles "SOL" club, who have the infamous loader version 1.00, don't despair, You will now be able to update yourself using on of those privately made flash writers or dongles for the Onkyo 805/705/605 and Integras. Check the other Onkyo / Integra firmware thread and add yourself to one of those (regional) lists (even Europe and other continents / countries). Note about dongle usage: >>"Thus, I am reemphasizing about dongle usage in this upgrade. make sure the marking &#8220;---> up&#8221; or pin &#8220;1&#8221; is in up direction with a magnifier visual inspect the connection between dongle contact and Onkyo connector, I realize this is somehow awkward to try, but it makes it more robust. As I explained this many times, Dongle PCB is cut by a scissor and me; NOT by a machine, so there are chances that Dongle&#8217;s front tip might be smaller or bigger than the actual Onkyo connector width. If bigger it won&#8217;t go in (DO NOT force it, you may bend the Onkyo connector, bad news). Just shave it with a nail filer. If it&#8217;s smaller then try to shift it up or down to make the contact. "<< ------ Supposed to fix DTS HD-MA "bomb" / digital garbage issue (DSP). Supposed to improve / fix audio switching delay and lipsync issues (Main 1.08). Supposed to improve net radio and preserve Audyssey Pro setup (Main 1.09). Some users reported, that after a clear, hard reset and new Adyssey installation the sound of the 905 improved even further (1.09). Some users reported improvement IQ (resolution/details) whilst up scaling using the Reon (1.09). See enclosed attachments (PDF) below for installation instructions (same as in archives). Download Links: The download pages feature a premium option, You have to pay for, but this is just an option and not needed for the downloads. If You don't have a premium account already don't worry, just choose the free download, which has some (minor) limitations: - Do NOT use download managers or accelerators, as these won't work on free downloads, just plain IE, Opera, Firefox etc. - The downloads are somewhat slower on the free option than on the premium option. - If You download more than once per day (free acount) from the same IP, then a time "penalty" waiting period might be enforced. - Please read the instructions for the free download at the site carefully. Note: I do *NOT* profit in any way from these downloads. If any of those files listed have not been downloaded for the last 30 days, the corresponding link might have been automatically deleted from the server to save space, thus making the file unavailable. Note: They are "official" release version files. These files are been employed by Onkyo service points and handed out elsewhere by Onkyo to customers (usually free of charge). They are identical to those versions preinstalled on factory fresh units (look HERE and HERE). Version numbers are model specific. These updates will upgrade "Main" and "DSP1" (and DSP2 / DSP3, if not current already). 905 Version IDs after 1.05: Main 9....1.05 / 07927A SR8051...07602A SR8052...07518A SR8053...07820B HDMI......1.01 / 07706A Video......07607E0924 Net........1.01 070731Z Net usr 07031 / 095118 Net rfs 07031 / 095118 Net krn 07023 / 145423 Net ipl 07023 / 123459 905 Version IDs after 1.08: Main 9....1.08 / 08223A SR8051...08214A SR8052...07518A SR8053...07820B HDMI......1.01 / 07706A Video......07607E0924 Net........1.01 070731Z Net usr 07031 / 095118 Net rfs 07031 / 095118 Net krn 07023 / 145423 Net ipl 07023 / 123459 905 Version ID after 1.09: Main 9....1.09 / 08414A 876 Version IDs after 1.01: Main 87....1.01 / 08801A 876 Version IDs after 1.04 + DSP1: Main 87....1.04 / 08Z22A SR9061...08919A SR9062...08605C SR9063...08506A HDMI......1.00 / 08627A Video......08703E01293 876 Version IDs after 1.05: Main 87....1.05 / 09116A Some interesting features of the 876 / 906: => Originally posted by "rickardl" Your mileage will vary, depending on your input signal and the output device's capabilities. I think it does a better job with 480i input than 480p sources. The Edge Enhancement does a really good job, it does not introduce much ringing but if there is ringing present in the input source, it will of course worsen it. I have found that "Picture Mode: Auto" works best for my sources. I am including the doc for the video adjustments. 1-1. Monitor Out Monitor Out: Use to choose which type of monitor output is being used (Analog/ HDMI Main/HDMI Sub). The following parameters are memorized for EACH Monitor Out: Resolution: * Through Output resolution is the same resolution of input signal. * Auto Output resolution is the highest resolution that TV corresponds that it can handle.("Auto" only available for HDMI Monitor out.) * 480p/720p/1080i/1080p Output resolution is the specified resolution. (1080p is only available for HDMI Monitor out.) * Source Output resolution is the specified resolution in Picture Adjust.(You can specify an individual resolution of each source.) (The following parameters are added to or subtracted from adjustments made for each input in "4-4 Picture Adjust" menu.) Example:"1-1 Monitor Out" Brightness is set to (+5), "4-4 Picture Adjust" Brightness is set to (-5), Monitor Output Brightness will be (0). Brightness: -50 to +50 (Changes by about 1 [RGB 0-255] in 1 step increments.) Contrast: -50 to +50 (Changes by 0.8% in 1 step increments.) Hue: -50 to +50 (Changes by 1 degree in 1 step increments.) Saturation: -50 to +50 R Brightness: -50 to +50 (Changes by about 1 [RGB 0-255] in 2 step increments.) R Contrast: -50 to +50 (Changes by 0.4% in 1 step increments.) G Brightness: -50 to +50 (Changes by about 1 [RGB 0-255] in 2 step increments.) G Contrast: -50 to +50 (Changes by 0.4% in 1 step increments.) B Brightness: -50 to +50 (Changes by about 1 [RGB 0-255] in 2 step increments.) B Contrast: -50 to +50 (Changes by 0.4% in 1 step increments.) 4-4. Picture Adjust These parameters are memorized for each source: Game Mode: On, Off (If set to "On", Video processor latency is lowered. However, some parameters such as Edge Enhancement, Mosquito NR are not available.) Zoom Mode: Normal, Full, Zoom, or Wide Zoom. ISF Mode: Custom, Day or Night. (Default Gamma for "Day Mode" is between 1.8 and 1.9, Default Gamma for "Night Mode" is between 2.2 and 2.4) The following parameters are memorized for each ISF Mode: (To make changes to the following parameters: Push and hold the "Display" button on the remote control for 8 seconds. If you exit the Setup Menu or return to "4. Source Setup" the parameters of ISF Mode "Day" or "Night" are Locked again.) Resolution: Through/Auto/480p/720p/1080i/1080p (When you choose "Source" in 1-1. Monitor Out -> Resolution, this parameter is effective.) Brightness: -50 to +50 (Changes by about 1 [RGB 0-255] in 1 step increments.) Contrast: -50 to +50 (Changes by 0.8% in 1 step increments.) Hue: -50 to +50 (Changes by 1 degree in 1 step increments.) Saturation: -50 to +50 Picture Mode: Auto/Video/Film (Auto- Automatically detect and process accordingly, Video- 20 fps, Film- 24 fps. Picture Mode function will not work if the source component (DVD player, etc.) is outputting progressive scan video.) Edge Enhancement: Off/Low/Mid/High (Use to make the picture appear sharper. Edge Enhancement function has no affect when the video resolution is down-converted, for example from 1080p to 720p.) Mosquito NR: Off/Low/Mid/High (Use to remove shimmering or hazziness that sometimes appears around objects in the picture. Can be issue w/overly compressed MPEG content.) Random NR: Off/Low/Mid/High (Use to remove indescriminate picture noise such as film grain.) Block NR: Off/On (Use to remove block distortion that can sometimes appear in the picture. Can be an issue w/overly compressed MPEG content.) (The NR (Noise Reduction) functions support all video input signals up to 480p/576p.) Gamma: -3 to +3 Example: If gamma of your monitor is 2.2, -3: total gamma is 1.6. 0: total gamma is 2.2. +3: total gamma is 2.8. R Brightness: -50 to +50 (Changes by about 1 [RGB 0-255] in 2 step increments.) R Contrast: -50 to +50 (Changes by 0.4% in 1 step increments.) G Brightness: -50 to +50 (Changes by about 1 [RGB 0-255] in 2 step increments.) G Contrast: -50 to +50 (Changes by 0.4% in 1 step increments.) B Brightness: -50 to +50 (Changes by about 1 [RGB 0-255] in 2 step increments.) B Contrast: -50 to +50 (Changes by 0.4% in 1 step increments.) Other Blue Mode (Blue Only Filter): If Blue Mode is On, R and G of output signal become 0. (To turn Blue Mode On/Off: From the front panel- push and hold "HDMI OUT" then push "MEMORY".) ITU Conversion (SD -> HD) Press down "HDMI Out" and "RT/PTY/TP" button (DIMMER for US model) to bring up ITU Conversion (SD -> HD) On Press "RT/PTY/TP" to toggle On/Off. Some cautious notes (and legal stuff): Do NOT contact me, if those links don't work (anymore). I don't take responsibility for them or their contents, I am just a scout As always: Read the instructions FIRST. Update Path: Onkyo / Integra instructions state, that the 1.08 / 1.07 / 1.09 upgrade / update should only be done, if You got min. 1.05 / 1.04 on Your unit preinstalled. But as has been mentioned by several users, the update worked fine from 1.01 upwards (beware of 1.00 so). The prerequisite is, that the displayed loader version "Main Update" must be at least Ver.1.01/07615L (xx6 don't have this anymore, so don't worry) Just to be on the safe side, check Your loader version beforehand by entering Main Update Mode (leave it without doing anything by switching the unit off, if You want to). 905/8.8: if below 1.05 goto 1.05 first, then 1.08/1.09. 875/9.8/885: if below 1.04 goto 1.04 first, then 1.07/1.08. 805/7.8: if below 1.04 goto 1.04 first, then 1.08. Note: The stated versions refer to the *Main" firmware version not the "loader" version, which always must be at least 1.01 / 07615L. Don't mix up those important differences. There are reports, that direct updates from older versions did work, others reported some problems and reverted back to the recommended procedure. There is a lot of evidence (verified by now), that older 905/875/805 units with firmware/loader < 1.01 can't be updated this way. So BEWARE, or You might "brick" (make it non-functional) Your unit ! If in doubt, check with Your nearest Onkyo / Integra service point. Check Your existing Main firmware version: => Turn on Your unit, push & hold "Display", press "Standby", release buttons => To see additional firmware infos (DSPs etc) press button underneath "Tone" repeatedly ( don't wait to long) Onkyo / Integra have told us, that these updates should not be installed if Your current firmware to start with for 905 / 8.8 is below 1.05 or 875 / 9.8 / 885 is below 1.04 (same seems to hold true for the 805/7.8). Many users have used these updates on older firmware versions too without any problems. If You got an earlier version to start with, there might be additional steps to be taken (DSP:hardware modification + HDMI+NET:additional firmware) ! If this is the case, and You need them, contact Your nearest Onkyo / Integra service point for the complete update procedure. I told You so... Check Your existing Loader version: Note: Onkyo xx6 and Integra x.9 units don't have a visible loader version anymore. Updating the Main firmware can be done by anyone by going through the RS232 port provided as long as the installed loader version is 1.01 / 07615L or above. To check, what loader version Your unit has installed please follow this procedure: - Disconnect / unplug Your unit. - Whilst holding down the ENTER key re-insert mains plug. - Your unit should switch to Main update mode, displaying the current loader version installed. - Release ENTER key. OR - Disconnect / unplug Your unit. - Whilst holding down the TUNING UP key re-insert mains plug. - Your unit should switch to Main update mode, displaying the current loader version installed. - Release TUNING UP key. Only for xx5 and x.8 units: If Your loader version is 1.01 / 07615L or above You may continue with the update procedure. If not, please exit update mode by pressing STANDBY. Note: If Your loader version shows 1.00 please exit without doing anything by pressing STANDBY. If You don't You will be sorry if You continue with the update procedure, because Your unit will become non-functional while doing this. So...Beware ! It is suggested, that those updates are universal for the Western hemisphere. I can't verify this ... anyway, version IDs are identical. If in doubt, check with Your nearest Onkyo / Integra service point. Note: To verify the installations numerous users have installed and tested them and those updates worked just fine (to my knowledge). Installation procedures: The updates consists of ...a) DSP Firmware Update ...b) Main Firmware Update There are two update paths for these updates: - DSP firmware update: The firmware resides inside a .WAV file (!), which needs to be burned onto an audio CD and played back through a CD/DVD-player connected by an optical link (TOSLINK) to Opt1. There must be a one-to-one copy of the file and it must be transfered unmodified. Most older CD/DVD player will work just fine. Read the corresponding threads. - Main firmware update: The update routine uses a RS232 connection to the rear of the unit. The RS232 cable must be of type straight through (no crossover) with a male and female connector at the end. You need a PC with a COM1 port (default) or a USB => RS232 converter for this, as described elsewhere. The update procedure is been initiated through a supplied setup software, which handles everything. Integra: The update instructions differ somewhat for the Integras (excerpt) II) Procedure for Upgrading Main FW on the unit: Connect the RS232 port of your PC to the receiver (unplugged) RS232 port by using a RS232 straight cable. Keep unit unplugged. Press Tuning up button and in this condition you should plug the receiver in the AC outlet. You will see on the display &#8220;Main Update mode&#8221;. After this follow these steps. a) Open &#8220;App_Updater_XXX&#8221; folder and Double click on &#8220;update.exe&#8221;. You will see following GUI. b) Check the COM port. It should be same as the RS232 port of your PC connected to your receiver (usually COM1). c) Click on &#8220;Main Update&#8221; button Beware: Anyone with an "Audyssey Pro" installation: The original update routine by Onkyo/Integra of the "DSP" firmware is at fault, not the update firmware itself, deleting all Your (costly) "Audyssey Pro" settings. Be prepared therefore, to call in the Audyssey installer again afterwards ! I told You so... This holds true for the "normal" Audyssey parameters too. Your personal settings will be erradicated running the update routine of the "DSP". ... and You will not have the opportunity to save anything. A hardware reset is recommended strongly in any case to get the new firmware properly initialized. Audyssey should also be rerun after the update, because some things might have changed. Note: Audyssey has stated in the meantime, that nothing has changed in this firmware release with respect to the Audyssey implementation (but one never knows...Onkyo might have done something) Hardware Reset: The AV receiver contains a microcomputer for signal processing and control functions. In very rare situations, software "bugs", severe interference, noise from an external source or static electricity may cause it to lockup. In the unlikely event that this happens, unplug the power cord from the wall outlet, wait at least 5 seconds, and then plug it back in again. Note: This might take care of some strange behavior of Your unit, like malfunctioning of the muting. Initialisation ("Clear"): To reset the AV receiver to its factory defaults, turn it on and, while holding down the [VCR/DVR] button, press the [Standby/On] button. &#8220;Clear&#8221; will appear on the display and the AV receiver will enter Standby mode. All personal / individual setting will be cleared and replaced by factory default setting. Note: This will make You lose all Your individual settings. Onkyo / Integra has indicated, that the following method saves settings "permanently" (not on the "DSP" update). Note: It has been reported, that saving Your settings, will not survive the DSP firmware update procedure ! Be prepared to redo everything. So write down Your setting before updating the unit ! Note: Update 1.09 contains a form (PDF) just for this. 1) TO STORE SETTINGS (must be done first, otherwise the recall will not have anything to recall): Turn the unit on. From the front panel - Push and hold "Setup", then Push "Enter". The unit will display "Setup Store?", still holding "Setup" push "Enter" again and the unit will display "Setup Storing", then it will display "Complete" and thus the procedure is complete. I would advice anyone to do this after a successfull setup / Audysseys calibration, to preserve this for a later recall. 2) TO RECALL SETTINGS: Turn the unit on. From the front panel - Push and hold "Setup", then Push "Return". The unit will display "Setup Recall?", still holding "Setup" push "Return" again and the unit will display "Setup Recalling", then it will display "Complete" and thus the procedure is complete. Color space switching: Note: Originally Posted by rickardl. Discovered on a 876. Not sure if this has been mentioned here... On the front panel, press down "HDMI Out" and "RT/PTY/TP" button (DIMMER for US model) to bring up ITU Conversion (SD -> HD) On Press "RT/PTY/TP" to toggle On/Off. The "infamous" EEPROM error: Several users, who didn't follow the recommended update path => 1.05 / 1.04 (depending on model) then to the newest, got that infamous EEPROM / E2PROM error (others might have, too). Different solutions where suggested from user experience for this issue: a) go back to Main firmware 1.05 / 1.04 and then go to the latest 1.09 / 1.08 (Onkyo / Integra recommended update sequence). b) reflash / rewrite (retry) with the same firmware version up to three times, before giving up. c) do a hardware reset, then a software reset ("Clear") as described in the manula, afterwords a (not in the manual) "Store Settings" as described in this post. If all this didn't help, You probably should see Your regional Onkyo / Integra service point for a cure. I found an interesting post in another thread here, which might get rid of this problem, which many have experienced: Note: Others having the same problem had to get one of the chips exchanged due to hardware failure / defective chip. Quote: Michael Carey How I cured my E2PROM ERROR problem Hi Everybody, I posted this in the Integra DTR-8.8 thread, but I thought I would add it here as well. I've spend the last 24 hours testing various firmware update procedures and I think I found a cure for the power failure E2PROM ERROR message on my DTR-8.8. I'm not sure if this will work with other Integra/Onkyo models, I hope others out there can try this out and report back. After the main unit firmware update, you get a COMPLETE message on the display, then CLEAR appears and then the unit goes into standby. I found that this doesn't completely clear the receiver, I found that network settings & internet radio stations remain intact after a firmware update... so the next thing to do is a full factory reset by pressing and holding the "VCR/DVR" button on the front panel down and then pressing the "Standby/On" button. This clears EVERYTHING! Now, before you get too carried away with getting all your settings back to how you like them... do this. On the front panel, press and hold the "Setup" button and press the "Enter" button. "Setup Store ?" will appear on the display. While still holding down the "Setup" button, press the "Enter" button again. You will then see "Setup Storing" on the display. I found this was the magical step that made the dreaded E2PROM ERROR go away. Until I completed the Setup Store, virtually every time I pulled the plug on the receiver, I would get an E2PROM ERROR message upon restoration of power and my settings would vanish. I found this only needed to be done once, right after the full factory reset. Even after changing settings on the receiver, it would still remember what I had changed, even if I didn't do the "Setup Store ?" procedure afterwards. My theory is that the "Setup Store" somehow formats the E2PROM memory to the requirements of the newly flashed firmware. I would be very interested to see if others plagued with the E2PROM ERROR message has any luck with the above procedure. Color Space Bug It has been mentioned (and measured) by several users, that there is an issue with the way Onlyo / Integra have implemented the Reon VX HQV - used in the 875 / 905 models - leading in some situations to mapping errors in the color values displayed. Here are two links to the resulting mapping errors to be expected in these cases: Color Space Bug examples 1 Color Space Bug examples 2 Remember: If You are unsure, what all those infos or technical details mean or what You are doing ... Don't do it! Get professional advice, before You brick (damage) Your unit. But ... I haven't heard of any problems looking through hundreds of posts on different threads (up to now) as long as you follow the instructions and advice supplied. The update routines are reasonable "fault tolerant". You may revert to an older firmware anytime, if needed, in any case. No guarantees whatsoever ! I do not suggest or advice anyone, to install anything or make use of it. I am not connected or affiliated with Onkyo/Integra in any way. Don't hold me (or Onkyo/Integra or anyone else) responsible for anything You are doing. You are on Your own, as always ... Take care... and have fun. << Bump this one up, if You use the downloads or profit from this thread, so others may find it without searching PS.: Just added some pictures about a cooling solution for the 905, which should work on other units as well (DSCFxxxx_800.jpg). This one allows placement of other units ON TOP of the 905 and hides underneath those units (fans: http://www.buy.com/retail/product.as...48527&ref=lmcd) ! My favorite fans (120 mm) are the Noiseblocker M12-S1 units. 8dbA @ 750 rpm @ 12 VDC. Inaudible even listening closely. Noise level is certified by the German T?V institute. .</Content>
