		<Content>We're familiar with the WECT Wilmington issue, where the digital coverage was less than its old analog. And, I thought I read somewhere that this situation may be possible with 15% (?) of stations. How about a list of notable examples? Here's one for starters: KTVO ch 3 Kirksville MO (ABC) 100 kW at about 1100' analog ch 3; 87 kW about 1000' digital on UHF ch 33. Coverage radius shrinks from about 65 mi to about 45 miles.</Content>
