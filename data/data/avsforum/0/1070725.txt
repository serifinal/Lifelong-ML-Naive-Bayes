		<Content>This forum is awesome. I just love reading about all the builds and wish I had a huge basement to do a dedicated theater in but maybe the next house. I just bought a new house last month. One of the reasons we picked this house was because it was big enough on the first floor for "everyday living" but then had more space upstairs for "other things". These other things consist of a home office, playroom, possibly guest room, and a TV area. We have toyed around with how to do this upstairs as there is only two rooms, a "bedroom" and a bonus room to go along with a full bath and a large hall closet. Our latest design is to have the bedroom be a playroom/guestroom and the bonus room will be our media room/home office. Here is a couple of pictures of our bonus room: From the stairs: The dormer on the right side: Left wall: Dormer/right wall: Hallway and stairs on the "back wall": The room measures approximately 12'7" W x 30' 6" long x 8' H. The flat part of the ceiling is 7' W. The left wall tapers to a height of 67 3/4" and the right wall tapers to 69". For now my office will be at the end of the room with an L shaped desk around the window. The TV area is going to be at the end near the stairs with the TV going on the left wall along with the fronts and a sub as well as a built-in equipment rack between the half wall and the dwarf-door leading to storage. If I do a dedicated theater in this room my thought is to build out a false wall at the end of the room, hiding the window, use an AT screen (size TBD), possibly a stage if I have enough height, have two rows of seating with 3 chairs each or a couch/love seat arrangement. The back row will be on a riser. The room would then either have a false wall at the rear or be open as it currently stands. I would still need to leave room for an office toward the stairs. Now my questions: 1. If I do a false wall for an AT screen how much room should be between the existing wall and the false wall? 2. Approximately what size screen do you think is "doable"? 3. How far would that put my viewing distance for each row? 4. I would need to leave room behind the last row for walking space. How much? 5. What should I do for construction? The room is above the garage with no other rooms directly adjoining, although the hallway at the back of the room leads to a full bath and bedroom. The walls are all insulated as is the floor and ceiling. I see no need to rip the drywall out, except for maybe some help in running wires for the PJ, lights, and speakers, but I can get behind the existing walls through the storage doors (which the storage will need to be retained for our extra junk and Christmas stuff, etc.) and can get on top of the ceiling through other attic access. Should I still do double drywall with GG in between? 6. I would likely do a rear soffit for the PJ if the distance worked out, but what about side soffits with the sloped walls? I was thinking I could come straght down for the edge of the flat celing with the soffit, maybe just a small one at 6" or so for crown molding and possibly some can lights. 7. What do I do with the dormer on the right? I could do an equipmetn rack there but maybe a small concession area instead and leave the equipment rack outside the room. Are there any other obstacles to overcome with this room that you can see? Sorry for such a long post, but thanks for any advice you could give.</Content>
