		<Content>A little bit about myself: My name is Doug and I have been lurking/posting for about 3 years now. I finished my basement (almost) before I discovered this forum and FP and have since been looking to change my setup so that I could enjoy a bigger movie/gaming experience. I have seen rooms being built that simply are amazing. From watching threads by chinadog, swithey, SandmanX, Ronnie_Jackson, BritInVa, strange_brew, WishIWasFlying and others too, I am motivated to start my own project. I want to thank you (especially those listed) for taking the time to post such wonderful information about your own project as it has helped many others as well as me, plan for my own build/setup. A little bit about my budget: While there is no set budget, its not unlimited. I am thinking anywhere from 2000-3000 is something I am shooting for. Which is small potato's to most threads here. A little bit about my existing equipment: Right now this is what I havean older but trusty Sony STR-DE985 Polk Audio RM6200 satellite speakers Polk Audio PSW250 Sub Woofer Toshiba HD DVD A2 - Sold on Ebay along with my 7 HD Movies Panasonic BD35K - From the preChristmas Amazon deal with 4 free BD's from Panasonic + 2 free BD from Disney Comcast HD DCH3200 Digital Cable box PT-AX200u Screen - Yet to be built 92" using BO Cloth (edit: 100" screen) While this list doesnt match up to most systems here, it is not that bad. I plan on upgrading in future to better speakers and receiver. A little bit about my room Pics are below but it is roughly 13' wide x 16' deep (opens to another 10' before it hits the back wall) Ceiling height is 7'6" with a soffit all around with soffit height being 6'8") I have a sump and a bathroom entrance in the WRONG spots, but I have to work with what I have and will try and make the best of it! A little bit about my (realistic) goals: While I sure would like to do something to the likes of many here on this forum, I simply understand what is realistic and attainable. So please understand that while I should be doing so many other things for a better room, I simply must stay within my means. Also, I firmly believe that in the end, while it may not sound or look as good as it could, it will be a MUCH better and enjoyable experience than what I currently have. So, I present some pictures and welcome your input. I look forward to sharing my journey. EDIT: I thought to add one of my "finished" pictures here.</Content>
