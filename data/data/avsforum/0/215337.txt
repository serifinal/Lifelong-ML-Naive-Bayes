		<Content>Hello, we are remodeling our kitchen. On one wall we are flush mounting a Apple 23" Cinema display connected to a PC in a remote location through in wall wiring. We will watch TV and play music from on this computer and I am looking for decent speakers to compliment it. I have wired for two in ceiling speakers about a foot off the wall and about 2 to 4 feet apart, centered on either the display. The speakers are not in the wall because its a thin (4") external wall and they would subtract form the insulation. (old house). I could also place a center speaker on the wall surface below the display, but I have not yet found one of suitable size and dimensions. I am concerned that when watching tv, if the sound is only coming from those ceiling speakers, the audio will seem displaced from the display. Its an 8' ceiling and one typical view area is about 8' away (the kitchen work area) and the other is 3' from the display (the breakfast table is right in front of the display) Question 1) Is this true? Or would picking the correct stereo ceiling speakers provide acceptable TV viewing and music? Its a kitchen so we are not looking for Home Theatre like quality, but I am hoping for something a little better the typical built-in TV speakers. I would like to mount a small, flat 'center' speaker just below the display on the wall surface, but the aesthetics are important. The Apple monitor lays flat against the wall (we recessed the mount), so ideally the speaker would be on the order of 1" to 2" thick and less than 21" wide. The display is 21" x 14" x 3/4". Question 2) Does anyone know of a small, flat, wall mountable center speaker? I have not been able to find any. A flat bar speaker would be acceptable. I am looking to spend several hundred on each speaker, but would consider any price for a speaker that works well in this setup. Thanks for your time considering my situation. Over the years the members of AVSForum has been a great help to me and I appreciate it. --BobG</Content>
