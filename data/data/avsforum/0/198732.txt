		<Content>I am now 100% complete and wanted to post some final pics so people can see the end of the journey. Thanks to all in the forum that provided help and support ! All pics = here Well it has been a labor of love for the last year and I am in the final straight with the PJ (Marantz VP-15S1) and 120" Stewart Firehawk G3 comming next week. So much so that if paying the bills was not an issue, I would love to design/build HT's for a living...........what a blast this hobby we all have!!! Thought I would share with the forum what it looks like today and will post back once I get the final pieces (8 Berkline chairs come in about another month). DSC00933.jpg = This is one of the antique Candleabra's in the room DSC01004.JPG = This is the front view into the HT.....of course Screen, Chairs and PJ still to come DSC00966.JPG = This is one of the 2 columns that took quite some time to put together and make sure it was stable enough for children to climb (of course they will not or I will......) DSC00913.jpg = Customized signage - First message I had up there was one to improve WAF (sorry this is a PG audience so I had to pull it down :-)) as I spent a lot of time/money on the build and I have look for every opportunity to make her happy (note: "BubbyMac" is my wife's nickname) DSC00906.jpg = I always wanted to build all the equiptment into a wall so used this opportunity to make something from scratch: Vista HP Mediacenter with 2TB Storage (loaded up 200+ movies, Pictures, etc). Also built a slide out keyboard and mouse draw to work off Denon 5803CI AVR Denon 3800BDCI Blu-ray Xbox360 & PS3 Direct TV HD DVR I created 3 boxes to house a Zune, Phillips Pronto TSU7000 remote and wirless mouse charger. Here are a few more images Overall it was great experience and am counting the hours until next friday for the final install. Will post back with the finals soon but if you want all the pictures from this and my other build, feel free to click on my sig details below</Content>
