		<Content>Hello, I am looking for a solution to turn a art niche (3' x 6' barrel ceiling feature) into a sky. The niche already has fiber rope and looks good. A sky or even Italian themed ceiling feature is what we are after. If I could dim the lights down a star ceiling could even come into play? Any ideas-do not want to pay 700 + for a graphic vynil but more like a wallpaper in sections. Thanks, Tyler</Content>
