		<Content>Ok, so I'm new at constructing a HT in a basement. I've done several basements, but not a HT. I guess the homeowner has 2 choices? Sound quality with no soundproofing, or Sound quality with soundproofing. If I construct the interior walls (not facing concrete) via staggered, insul. and double drywall, including double drywall the ceiling- I would be towards having a good sound proofed room and have good sound quality, no? But if the homeowner doesn't really care too much about soundproofing, how would I construct the room for sound quality? Not sure If I'm missing something. Please help.</Content>
