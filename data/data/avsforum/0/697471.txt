		<Content>Group: Pardon me if this question has been asked already. For the first time today, I tried to play a Blu-Ray disk on my computer. I have a Sony SxRD 60" TV with one of the HDMI inputs connected to a Radeon (Diamond) HD 3450 video card on the PC. I've got the full Windows XP desktop coming out properly on my TV. I launch the ArcSoft (a demo version I downloaded yesterday from Cnet and installed) media player. No problem. I put a BR disk in the drive, after twenty seconds or so, the media player starts playing a short video clip and goes for 2-3 seconds. Then it stops. The message: "Your system is not compatible with HDCP, BD playback is disabled" comes up. So I know the video card is HDCP-compatible. There must be some enabling of this that I haven't done yet. What do you who are observing this forum suggest I do to fix this? Thanks in advance. rlowell</Content>
