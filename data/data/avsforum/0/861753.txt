		<Content>- Please note this is not my Construction Thread, I will start one soon this week when I get all the facts - What's happenig folks, I am in the early stages of my basement home theater construction and I always like to be ahead of the game when it comes to proper planning and measuring. I am trying to figure out whether I should go 1.78:1 (16:9), or go all out with a 2.35:1 or 2:40:1 screen. I have read probably over 15 existing threads related to the subject but I still have some unanswered questions. Here is my current situation, facts, and numbers: - Actual Theater Room size: is 22.5' L x 8' H x 14.6' W (with some areas of 7' ceiling) - Projector of choice: the Epson 1080UB (Home or Pro since tech specs are the same) - Screen Height: (Maximum 96, Usable portion would be about 70"-75" since I will lose about 20"-25" between soffit and stage) - Utilization: 60% Bluray Movies, 30% 360/PS3 16:9 Gaming, 10% 16:9 HD Dish/broadcasts - Screen Type: Either a Transparent SMX w/ speakers behind or just a standard w/ speakers outside to sides and center (prefer transparent screen in order to get max width) - Audio: Denon 3808CI with either my current 7.1 Polk RT/CS series or upgrade to a similar large size Eclipse set up. I ultimately want to build a Cinema Room, not an "Xbox/Rockband gaming room." I already own close to 250 BD movies and another 500 DVDs, so I LOVE movies and I want the best and biggest experience possible So I am leaning more towards the 2.35:1 SMX Transparent screens so I can get maximum viewing width with a Constant Image Height that should display 16:9 or 2.35:1 images. I have a maximum screen width of 175" and a maximum constant height of 75", so according to the math, I have these options available to me - Max Height of 75": - 1.78:1 = Max 153" Diagonal (Max width of 12.7 feet) - 2.35:1 = Max 191" Diagonal (Max Width of 14.7 feet) - 2.40:1 = Max 195" Diagonal (Max Width of 16.3 feet) Obviously I will only be able to use about 14 feet of maximum width, so I would essentially end up with a 185"-190" Maximum diagonal 2.35:1 or 2.40:1 screen. So, now that you know the facts what do you honestly recommend for a movie lover like myself (movies and music will always be more important to enjoy for me than gaming): I would like to get the Epson 1080UB projector, but I am open to suggestions as I would like to use a wide 2.35:1 screen, so what do I need to purchase in order to fulfill the best results? - Which Anamorphic lens would you recommend (possibly under or around the $1000 range). - Do I need a scalar, or is the Epson 1080UB is capable of projecting through a universal anamorphic lens with the built-in scalar? - If I have to buy a scalar to use the 2.35:1 lense then How much do they cost and which one should I buy? I am a "more-bang-for-the-buck" kind guy, and I am not ready or willing to spend another $3000 on top of the $3000 projector to get the results I need. - What screen ratio would you recommend wholeheartedly in my current situation? 2.35? 2.40? 1.78? - Which screen aspect ratio would backward compatible to accomodate all other aspect ratios, considering we're using a a CIH (constant image height) of 70" to 75"? Going for a "one-size-fits-all" mentality. - Would you recommend any other projectors other than the one I have in mind (Epson 1080UB)? - Lastly, which screen brands would you highly recommend for either audio-transparent or traditional? Everyone seems to be loving a SMX audio transparent, so how much would it cost for a max screen of 168" W x 75" H? Sorry for the EXTRA long post, but I want to make sure I lay out all the facts and hope to get as much feedback as possible. I expect to start my dreaded construction thread sometime this week or weekend. Thanks in advance for all the advice, feedback and inspiration that this particular forum provides. - Sam</Content>
