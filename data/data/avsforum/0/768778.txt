		<Content>Guess it's time for me to use this site to document my progress. I have been in the project/ht stuff since the introduction of the Infocus 4805. Back then, it was just the couch, projector, a pulldown screen and some window blinds. All this time, I have always (like everyone else) wanted a dedicated room for ht built. Guess thanks to the weak housing market, it has finally come true. This year, we brought our 2nd home. Throughout the looking process, each home we looked at had to have that requirement. So, in February, we brought the house. On the 2nd floor, we have a spare room that measure 11.75 x 16 with one windows toward the back side. So with the wife approval, we have our ht room. Some detail and requirement outline: - current screen size is 118" BOC with 4in black border - can go smaller if needed - DONE - Mitsubishi HC4900 1080P projected mounted on monoprice mount - Onkyo with JBL 7.1 system. - 2 row of theatre seats on 12in riser - xbox 360 - htpc running xp media center - hd dvd a3 - zenith dvb318 upconvert dvd player some requirements: - must be able to convert back to bedroom if needed - little to no modification to existing structure - due to above - small budget (with house and young kids, one can't really spend that much) Done so far: - paint the wall - build and install screen - brought and mounted projector - brought and install chairs - build riser need to do: - run cables in wall - done. - move receiver inside closet with rest of gears. - done - figure out what to do with front and center speaker - use wall mounted speaker instead. - done. - reverse the door??? - decided not to. Here's current status: For now, HT 1.0 is finished. Tons of changes maded since I last updated.
