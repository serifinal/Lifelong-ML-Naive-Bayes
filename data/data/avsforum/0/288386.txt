		<Content>so right now in my living room I have a Sony 52" W4100 and a Samsung 40" A650 side by side. I've had the Sony for a few days now and the 650 for about a month. Anyways, i'll be returning the 650 to BB shortly, so while I still have them both in my living room, I thought I might as well do a service to those people out there who are still on the fence between these two fine sets and compare them. so, let the showdown begin... Note: this comparison is pretty subjective, i'm just gonna report what I see. picture settings on both TVs aren't exactly identical or optimized, but I use Cnet's settings. Also, I didn't have a HDMI splitter so I could only see one tv playing at a time and have to pause/freeze the other to make comparisons. and lastly, one is a 52" while the other is only 40"...so not exactly an ideal comparison, but whatever... Blacks: I like deep blacks, to me it is most important aspect of PQ, so naturally most of my time were spent looking at black levels. this one was close. With daylight or bright lighting, the Samsung 650's blacks looked much nicer and deeper, it gives colors and images more "pop" and they really stand out. On the other hand, the sony W4100 had just as deep shades of blacks, however, due to its matte/semi-glossy screen, the blacks looked washed out and hazy because it absorbs light rather than reflect them like the glossy screen on the 650. so the 650's excellent blacks during the daytime definitely make everything look much better than the W4100 thanks to its glossy screen, however this comes at a cost since the glossy screen does produce a ton of glare if there's a lot of bright lighting with windows nearby like I do. The W4100 was somewhat better at cutting down the glare, but still, during the daytime both TV's were terrible with dark movies/scenes. however, both were fine as long as I only watched bright and colorful contents such sports, videogames or cableTV. but for most movies, especially those dark movies with letterboxes, I find it better to view them during the evening and best in a completely dark room. speaking of which, when evening/nigh-time rolled in, things got a little more interesting... when there was no light reflections/glare, black levels on both sets were equally good. however, once the room got completely dark, that's when the W4100 really outperforms the 650 in delivering much deeper inky blacks; the 650's blacks just looked a bit grayish, even when I adjust the backlight to levels below 3--crushing the blacks--it still didn't look as dark as the W4100 and the W4100 could get even darker in certain dark scenes with autodimming(more on this later) but of course this crushes blacks and kills details in shadows ..speaking of which... Shadow Details:IMO, retaining details in really dark scenes is equally as important as having deep blacks. this one was a close call as well, but the edge goes to the W4100 because it was able to deliver much better shadow details in dark scenes while still maintaining darker blacks. I did try to get the 650 to show more details by upping the brightness past 50 and backlight past 3, but this kills the blacks. for instance, in the pic below, I was able to clearly see on the W4100 the details in the folds on the guy's jacket and the dark things at the bottom right corner, but on the 650 most were just a glob of black and I only saw a small part of the things in the bottom corner. also, at the center of the pic there is suppose to be a man's face/head, which I could make out the Sony, but it was all black on the Sammy.</Content>
