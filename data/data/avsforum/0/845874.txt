		<Content>Thought I take some time to post the final pictures of my bedroom conversion HT project that took around 4 to 5 months. See build thread for more details: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1038062 The screen is current 118in with felt wrap foam mask on top and bottom. Screen material is blackout cloth wrap with 1x4 wood wrap in felt. Screen is painted with Black Widow gray paint mix. Wall artwork are premade ones that can be found at the local blockbuster from 14.99 to 39.99. Perfect solution for those lazy like me. All mine are 14.99 ea. Big nice and comfy seats. They recline too... Basic night light use to light the stair way so the kiddie don't fall. Riser is 12in with 6in step against wall. Seats are Coaster Studio like/clone. Very comfy and a bargain at 1K for all 6. Note the shade toward the back on the 1st step is actually my 12in sub. Want a clean setup, so anything can be place in the front. Also notice that the speaker in the back are black while the rest are silver. That's because I only have 5 JBL SCS300 SAT, so I had to use 2 Advent. For rear surround, the Advent works perfectly with the JBL. Curtains are blackout sueue from walmart. Still deciding if I should added another 2 more panel. Projector is Mitsubishi HC4900 1080P mounted on Monoprice mount. Inside the closet is rack with HD DVD Player, HTPC, Xbox 360, WII and Zenith DVB 318 Upconvert DVD Player. The receiver is still the good old Onkyo 503 (future upgrade to the 606). That's about it. I really like to thx everyone that help with getting to this point. Now all we do watch stuff all the time.</Content>
