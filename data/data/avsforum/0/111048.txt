		<Content>UPDATE: The room is done. To jump directly to pictures of the completed room, click here: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showp...4&postcount=73 My current HT started off as the leftover space from my basement finishing, that I throw my old big screen TV into. It started off like this: I then decided to create a false front wall to make it look sort of like a small movie screen. It then became this: I then decided I wanted the whole room to have acoustical treatments, and look more like a dedicated room. so it then became this: Well my TV recently had an issue, so Best Buy's extended warranty got me a new TV. They've giving me an in store credit for a new TV, which I'm using to buy an Optoma HD71. If I was smart, I would just do the necessary wiring for the projector, and redo the front wall. but I'm getting a little tired of the way it looks, so I thought I would just completely redo it. I am using this theater (AVS user named "Hed") as inspiration: My room is very small (current size is 11'wide x 16' long but I'll be expanding into the 8' wide x 5' long behind the rear columns), so it won't look as good as this one, but I'm going to try my best. I'm going to build a stage, have a 16:9 110" screen. I'm going to add side surrounds to go from 5.1 to 7.1, and I'm going to put a small riser behind the current theater seating and try to find a black leather 2 seater couch that matches. The rear columns will then be behind it. The equipment rack will be built into the rack in the wall behind the current seats. I hope to get my building materials this weekend, and get a good chunk of it done. Wish me luck!</Content>
