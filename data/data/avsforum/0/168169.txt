		<Content>My wife and I just purchased a new construction home with a 13' W x 19' 4" L x 10' H Theater Room. I have been researching and dreaming of building a HT for over a year now. Here is the equipment I have so far. Klipsch RF-83 Front Klipsch RC-7 Center Velodyne F1500 Sub Onkyo TX-SR703 7.1 Receiver The main things I still need are a 1080p projector, screen, 200x5 amp, Klipsch RS-62 Rears, Blu-Ray player or PS3, Universal Remote, Lighting and Seating. Most of the equipment will likely be placed in the linen closet just outside the HT. We just finished painting the ceiling black and the walls are painted a dark red (swatch is called Spanish Tile). Going to apply a 2nd coat on the walls on Monday. I have drawn up two diagrams (shown below) that are to scale to help me in the design stage. I drew the top layout awhile back and at that time I drew it with a 110" screen. Ignore the sweet spot info. That will likely change somewhat. In the top view, the right rear has a large sliding glass door (where the broken wall is) that will be covered with thick curtains that have already been purchased. The Front image shows a 120" screen which is what I'm leaning towards. I'm currently looking at getting a Panasonic PT-AE2000U Projector. Please don't think I'm a nerd (ok...maybe I am) but I actually busted out my old Trigonometry math using this online calculator. LOL. If I have my first row at 13' from the front wall, using a 120" screen (which is 5' tall), the horizontal viewing angle from my eyes to the top of the screen is 21 degrees if the bottom of the screen was at eye level. This THX Diagram suggests that the angle should be 15 degrees or less. In order to achieve 15 degrees or less, I would need to lower the screen so that the bottom of the screen is below eye level. I lowered the screen just to the top of the center channel speaker to get it as low as I could. I did not redo the math to see if it would then be less than 15 degrees. Should be close enough. Told ya I was a nerd. The AV rack in the front is not necessarily what I'm going to use. I just pulled it off the net to give me an idea of what it would look like with an AV rack up front. Ha! I just realized I didn't add my Velodyne sub in the image. Oops. It should fit between the front speaker and the AV Rack. Any thoughts on my plan so far? Is there anything that I'm off on at this point? Front View Top View</Content>
