		<Content>Just wondering if I need to cut some 4&#8221;x10&#8221; holes on the top of my riser (covered by registers) or not. My riser facts: -Riser is about 18 inches high, by 11 feet wide (width of room) by five feet long -Riser is in the back 1/3 rd of the room from wall to wall but decoupled from any wall -Riser is lifted off ground by about 1 ? inches by rubber feet -Have two butt kickers in riser -Riser is filled with Roxul Safe n Sound insulation -Riser is enclosed on all four sides and top by ?&#8221; plywood -Bottom of riser is somewhat open - I layed 2x4&#8217;s flat at the bottom part of the riser leaving about 4 inch spacing between pieces. Plastic and mesh was layed over the flat 2x4 to hold the insulation off the ground. Is my opening of about 1 ? inches at bottom of riser enough for effective broad band bass trapping or do I need to add a bunch of 4"x10" holes near corners and back wall (covered by registers) on the top of the riser? Thanks Frank See two pictures attached: 1. First shows riser covered by 3/4 inch plywood. Although the pictures shows the top centre part of the riser with a very large hole I did cover that with 3/4 inch plywooed too. The centre is where the butt kickers are placed. 2. Second picture just shows the bottom of the riser before insulation to give you an idea of the spacing between the flat 2x4.</Content>
