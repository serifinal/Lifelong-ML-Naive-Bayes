		<Content>This is my very 1st post, so I want to give you a little background to start? This is my first attempt at building a dedicated home theater. I recently saw this 147? size screen in a local retail store in CA called Theater Extreme. Of course it had the entire theater ambience to go with the dedicated room. In this room, the store was projecting a JVC RSX1 about 14? from the screen. I admit I am totally inexperienced and new to this technology; however I was totally blown away how sharp this HUGE picture looked. I watched a short demo (smiled) and thought?. ?I got to get me one of these!?? That was my birth into the quest of learning all about the world of home theater. I have been reading many forums and appreciate your knowledge and experience to help educate the new guys like myself. So my thought was? if I was going to build a dedicated home theater -- why not make it feel like a real theater with a really big screen? I already got it? I bought a 147? (diagonal) Vutec Sound Screen3 (EasyVu ? Fixed Screen). The 3% material is their newest, latest and greatest (tighter weave) sound fabric. (My room size is 23? wide by 24? deep with only an 8? ceiling) I plan on placing the speakers behind the sound screen in a 26? deep wall cavity. I plan on mounting the projector using a ceiling mount at the best optimum distance from the screen. After reading all these forums, it seems the JVC units have captured the market. I?m excited as the true enthusiasts to see and hear the reviews about the RS20. However, I would appreciate to hear what experienced HT hobbyist think would be the best projector for my particular application and especially my screen size. I sure hope I didn?t shoot my own foot buying a 147??(but it?s to late now) I was heavily leaning towards the RS20, unless someone could convince me otherwise. I?ve always had this issue about ?crying once?...buy the BEST you can afford (at the time) and be happy and enjoy it for years to come. Is this the best option for my situation?</Content>
