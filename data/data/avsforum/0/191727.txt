		<Content>Well... I assume this thread might be getting a lot of action soon. The 706 comes with the MultiEQ + DynamicEQ + 1080P + a plethora of HDMI ins + the all important blue back-lit volume knob--that is what sold me. I have one being delivered this week. I will report back with my initial impressions.</Content>
