		<Content>I've recentally upgraded my HTPC by adding an ATI HD 3870 graphics card to it. The whole point of doing this was so that I could connect it up to my Onkyo 705 by HDMI so that I can get better sound out of it, plus it invovles chaning the channel fewer times However, when I connect it up like I want to, there is no picture shown on the TV at all. If I plug the card straight into the TV over HDMI or VGA then I get the desktop of the machine. I've setup the Onkyo box correctly and I've tested the wire and setup with both and AppleTV and a Sky HD box and they work perfectly. Its almost like the card doesn't detect that the Onkyo is there so doesn't output anything at all. Any idea ?</Content>
