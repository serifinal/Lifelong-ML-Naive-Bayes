		<Content>I think it's coming soon. ASUS usually doesn't have a hint of product info until right before the release: http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1=25&l2=150 http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1...55&modelmenu=1 http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1...55&modelmenu=2 No drivers yet though. Any thoughts on when this is pop out of ASUS? Has anyone else noticed the added product page? I'm almost certain that by now, the 4000-series ATI cards will have only limited LPCM with no PAP and so no different than the analog I'm using now.</Content>
