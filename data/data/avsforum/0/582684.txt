		<Content>Welcome to the Copper Pub...the still ongoing, still transforming, ever changing home pub build thread. Pull up a chair, have a drink and swap stories, ideas, complaints, & designs with us. Well this is way overdue so I am finally starting my first thread after countless years and hours at a time of viewing and sitting behind the scenes. I first want to thank a few threads that really helped me without really knowing it, some gave me construction ideas, what not to do's, what products they used and most importantly a place to get ideas and pictures. A quick shout out to Heynow^'s, Chinadog, Big E's, Dinger23 and many I can't remember off the top of my head. Thanks to all of you I think I have created a space my family enjoys (although not 100% completed yet) and proud I've done it all myself. I plan on adding numerous pic's in the near future of the build, past -present- future. Any questions don't hestiate to ask.
