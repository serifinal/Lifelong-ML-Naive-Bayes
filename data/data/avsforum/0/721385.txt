		<Content>Several plasmas (Samsung, LG, Panny) claim to have brigthness sepcifications of 1000 cd/m2 to 1500 cd/m2. Any high-end LCD (XBR4, LNxx81F) has brightness specs of 500 cd/m2 or less. 1) Has anyone known technical reasons why plasmas can reach so big score, compared with LCD's ? 2) And why plasma pictures can't get that bright in real life ? (P.S. - I know brightness is not an important factor in PQ evaluation)</Content>
