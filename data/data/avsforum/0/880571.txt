		<Content>Ok after participating in the Panasonic PZ80/PZ85 owners thread it seems more and more people are reporting this issue which has been described as "color flicker", or "brightness shifting", or other names. I think we are all referring to the same issue. In trying to figure this issue out I thought it might be helpful to have our own thread for this issue. I want to collect as much data on this as possible to try to maybe figure this out. 1. First what picture setting is your tv on when you notice the issue (Cinema, Standard, Vivid, Custom?). 2. What are your calibration settings (picture, brightness, the most important, as well as the others). 3. Any processing set to on such as C.A.T.S. or Noise Reduction, etc. 4. About how many hours of viewing does your tv have racked up? 5. When was the TV manufactured? 6. Where was the TV purchased? 7. What kind of power is the tv plugged into? (standard surge protector, power conditioner, line filter, etc) 8. What sources you have noticed the effect on, and how those sources are connected to the tv. 9. Any other details which may be of interest. So me first: 1. Cinema, although it seems worse on Standard 2. Picture on 50, Brightness on 50, others will have to check when I get home. I have noticed that with the picture and brightness on lower settings the effect is more noticeable. 3. No processing 4. I haven't gone into the service menu to check but I am probably at 200-300 hours 5. February 2008 6. BestBuy.com 7. Cheap surge protector with no line filtering or anything else 8. Dish Satellite DVR ViP 622, mostly while watching HD shows or movies. Also have noticed it with HD DVD player A2 at 1080i setting while watching Battlestar Galactica HD DVD. Have not noticed it on Blu Ray (PS3) yet, but haven't watched much Blu on this set yet. Sources are all connected with HDMI cables from monoprice.com 9. I exchanged my original set that had this problem which seemed to mostly be on white backgrounds, or blue sky backgrounds. The new set I got now seems to exhibit these symptoms on flesh tones, people's faces alot. I recorded one snippet of Sopranos season 6, the baptism scene and Christopher's face will flash very badly when on Standard at pic 50 and brightness 50. But if I play it back on Cinema at pic 50, brightness 50, the flicker still happens but is much less noticeable.</Content>
