		<Content>Just got The X-Files: I Want to Believe Blu Ray and its not working with PowereDVD 8 Ultra. This happens with or without anydvd hd running in the background. My drive is the LG H20LK. I updated PowereDVD thinking that would fix the problem but that did not help. How can I get this to work?</Content>
