		<Content>I am still worried about letting the Sony Blu-ray player to run the break in DVD over night or while I am at work uninterrupted on my pioneer elite 101. I am wondering if it is okay to run the Break in DVD ISO image on a computer hooked up to the panel via HDMI and connected to a Uninteruptible Power Supply? Has anyone done it before and is it ok to go that route?</Content>
