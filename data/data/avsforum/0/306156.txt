		<Content>"The Lost Boys: The Tribe" (or 'The Lost Boys 2') actually wasn't as bad I expected it to be. I'm a hugh fan of the original "Lost Boys" and I expected TLB2 to be a quicky straight to DVD POS. To my surprise I found myself enjoying this sequel of vamps with it's occasional over the top gore and typical 80's gratuitous naked breasts (especially the very hot Canadian singer Moneca Delain - BSG fans may recongize her from her small role as 'Blonde Woman' in 'Battlestar Galactica: The Miniseries')! It was fun seeing the return of two of the original cast members'Corey Feldman' as 'Edgar Frog' and "Corey Haim", in a small cameo as 'Sam Emerson'; not to mention the "Sax Player" (unfortunately Jamison Newlander's scenes as Alan Frog were cut). Once TLB2 was over I wanted to pull out my copy of 'The Lost Boys' and rewatch it. Worth a rent. Just go into it with low expectations and you may find yourself surprised. It's not the best but it's not the worst I've ever seen. If you enjoyed the original and miss the gratuitous naked breasts found in most all 80's movies then you will enjoy 'The Lost Boys: The Tribe". Available in SD or Blu Ray from Netflix, Amazon.com, etc. etc</Content>
