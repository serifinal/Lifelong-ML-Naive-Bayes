		<Content>I'm at a bit of a loss as to where to start in order to eliminate interference I'm getting. I have all my equipment sitting in central cabinet under my plasma TV. It looks something like this in terms of the individual shelves/cabinets: PVR | Cable Box | DVD | HTPC Dual Receiver | for Russound | CD | VCR | | HT Receiver | | Russound | I have RCA's from PVR, VCR, DVD, CD to HT Rec. I have RCA's from Dual Rec, Cable Box, DVD, HT Rec and 2x HTPC to Russound I have RCA's from HTPC to TV for video HDMI from PVR to TV (Rec is too old for HDMI) for video My sub-woofer cable runs behind the unit and exits to the left I've noticed a really bad rumble through my left speaker that sits above the PVR cabinet. It is particularly bad when watching TV through the PVR with bassier shows ie. Lost. I've had the speaker checked and it has a clean bill of health. I've switched the right and left speakers and it's isolated to the signal going to the left side. No problems noted with surround speakers or the center channel BTW. When watching DVD's no problem, when listening to audio sources through the HT Rec no problem. Therefore, I'm reasonably sure it's a problem with the audio source for the TV being the PVR and it seems to be tied to bass signals being sent to the sub but I can't be sure (uneducated guess). There is a couple of splitters in this same cabinet as I've split the cable to feed the Dual Receivers as well as split it to the cable box for the Russound feed. I was going to start by replacing the RCA's from the PVR to the HT Rec but that's basically a guess on my part. Any suggestions on this would be most appreciated. Thanks!</Content>
