		<Content>Well, im all set to pull the trigger on my new TV purchase. I was set on the Sammy but I found out today that I can get the Sony W4100 for about $50- more. I know the Sony is newer, but in reality which is better?? I have read the Cnet review about the A650's and I know they are terrific tv's, but i cant help to think that the Sony is very good too. I know it does not have a 10 bit panel (I hate that) but besides that, what would you get?? I need to make my decision today before they run out of stock. Please help!!......</Content>
