		<Content>Ok i work for sears, and i own a 42 in sharp (lc-42d64u) i don't know the processing number. Ok i also have discovered that the Sony xbr tells u something about 10 bit processor 10 bit display. I am assuming this is one of the best you can get for an LCD tv because they show it and no other company does. I have searched manufacture websites ( which annoy me because they hide too much information ) do i have to call their customer service number to find out their processor speeds? So ok ya the new samsungs and sonys are catching my eye on a daily basis. I would like to compare them side by side piece by piece. There are little things that get to me though... like why doesnt sony tell us there response time? is it crappy? im assuming it is ( just like toshiba decides that contrast ratio should be hidden as well ) i think toshiba last year had like a 14 bit processor or something like that. Anyways i would like to find out the processor speeds for the new sonys and the new samsungs. If anyone knows where to get this information please help me out thank you. Also i would like to know what the processor is on my current television as i stated above. There's just too much to compare and not enough info for it right now. Sony has S series, V series, W series, Z series. i think i know which ones the best but what are the processors for samsung comparisons... A 530 a550 a650 a750... the a650 46 inch is like 2900 retail and the a 530 46 inch is like 1600. all i found in difference is like TOC... 120 hz. 4 ms vs 5 ms response time... umm infolink is on 650... but anyways is it really worth 1300 more to get 120hz 4 ms and TOC???? im thinking no but i would like to find out more infos on both new lines so i know which one is king of the hill for its class and which one is not for selling and consuming purposes^^ when i get the money... THANK YOU FOR ANY INFORMATION YOU CAN PROVIDE</Content>
