		<Content>Yea it's another one, but they are so useful :-). I started my build 2.5 years ago (well that's when I finished off the basement anyway. Didn't have the time/resources to complete the theater so the room has set unfinished since then. I putz now and then down there and finally back in November I figured it was time to make good on my threats. I figured I'd just do my own thing, but between the whole getting "Loganed" and the desire to get others opinions I'm starting my thread. CURRENT STATUS Actually redoing my design to eliminate the back columns see drawing below, I'm just too space challenged to give up the room. I'll just put the speakers into the wall. I just finished up some mockup drawings of the space. The colors are all wrong and this is just the first design which I'm trying to figure out if I like or not.. Still looking around to see how other folks have finished off their rooms. The drawings are sure nice for space planning though. Especially in trying to decide between 6 and 7 chairs. I don't have enough room to allow the back row to recline all the way but I still may do power recliners in the back and just try to figure out the electronics to stop them early. We'll see. My room dimensions are 15'.25 deep x 14.5 wide. Far from ideal, but I enlisted DE way back in 2005. I call him about 2x a year. I'm sure he's getting sick of it by now wondering why the heck I haven't finished yet. Here is what I started with. First thing I needed to do was get rid of those stupid little walls. So I replaces them with an I beam while we were finishing the basement. The beam weighs about 400 pounds, but it was well worth it. Did 2x6 staggered stud construction around the theater also did a dedicated HVAC unit for the theater and ran the ductwork. Once the rest of the space was complete I did start messing around running wire and such, but back in November I finally got around to doing the RCIS-1 clips and hat channel in the ceiling and put in the lighting. In the back of the room I have a little AV closet that I can get to from the Utility room. Unfortunately once I put a rack in there I'm not going to pass code as far as clearance in front of my sub-panel so I relocated that a couple weeks ago about 6 feet to the right. More to come. -Z</Content>
