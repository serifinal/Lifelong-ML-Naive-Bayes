		<Content>Problem: Two DVD recorders (1 Zenith, 1 JVC) on two branches of the main cable splitter. Both set to record e.g. Letterman at 11:30. Intermittently, *both* stop recording simultaneously after ~5, ~20, ~40 minutes. Some days the whole show records. There's no external evidence of AC abnormalities. Could this be a problem with the cable feed? (Time Warner customer support is so far clueless...)</Content>
