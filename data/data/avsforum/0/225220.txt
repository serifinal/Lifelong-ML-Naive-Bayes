		<Content>I have two TVs, and old 32" CRT with S-video in, and my Mitsubishi 720p 1500 projector with HDMI in. I want my upcoming HTPC (assuming it will be MythBuntu) to drive them both, because I try to limit using the projector. And my kids watch all their stuff on the 32. Is there a vid card with both HDMI and SVid out that will work? Hopefully something that can display on both at the same time. I don't want to have to toggle between the two video outputs.
