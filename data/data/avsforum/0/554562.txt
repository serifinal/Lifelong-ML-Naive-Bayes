		<Content>Hey all. I have been lurking the forums for a couple weeks doing research. There is a lot of good info on these boards. I have been remodeling my entire house for the past couple of years, and it is about time I do something with the living room. I am pretty space limited in the rest of the house so this room will have to do. Here are my plans so far: It's going to be a tight squeeze, but I think it will work out well when it is done. The toughest part of the remodel here is going to be the entertainment center. My house is OLD, and the space where the entertainment center is going is now occupied by a brick fireplace facade that I am going to rip out. Then, I'm going to attempt to build the entertainment center myself to somewhat match the existing woodwork in the house. The room is approximately 12' x 24'. I was originally looking at the Pioneer PDP5080HD for my display, but after looking at this layout, it may be too big considering the seating position will be about 8 feet at the most. I may end up going with a Panasonic TH42PZ700U instead. For a receiver I am looking at the Onkyo TX-SR705. For front speakers, I am looking at Polk R150's, center channel a Polk CSR. I haven't decided on wether to go with a 5.1 or 7.1 setup yet, but I am thinking either another pair of R150's for the side surrounds, or if space looks to be getting to tight - I may try and sink some Polk RC55i into the walls instead. If I do go 7.1, I was thinking of the same RC55i's for the rear surrounds. I am still up in the air on a subwoofer, but I have read good things about the H-100 sub. So what do you guys think? I have been looking for plans or directions or any kind of help in designing and building the entertainment center........any suggestions? Comments? Thanks alot.</Content>
