		<Content>The time has come to help potential buyers decide on either the S550 or the BD55. I received my S550 last week and bought the BD55 today. Now here is the comparison for both units. For the PQ comparison I used my parents 65" Sharp Aquos 1080P LCD. Build Quality S550 - Excellent for the price. Solid. Built in Japan. BD55 - Not bad for the price. Very good. Built in China. Winner - S550. Sound Quality From HDMI Output S550 - Very good, bass from the HDMI output is a little weak. BD55 - The sound quality from the HDMI output sounds fuller than the S550's HDMI output. I have to choice to use its internal decoders, or bitstream the sound to use my receiver's decoders. Winner - BD55. Bootup Time I had to be fair on the bootup time. I made sure that I disabled the quickstart mode on the S550. Both players bootup around 20 seconds. Winner: Tie. Loading Time S550 - It just depends on the disc. BD55 - A tad faster than the S550. Winner - BD55 Picture Quality S550 - Very good. Details are sharp, color is good, PQ has a natural look to it. BD55 - Excellent. Details are sharper than the S550, color is excellent and more vibrant than the S550, PQ has a somewhat glossy look to itm but also has a natural look to it. Winner - BD55. Conclusion As Panasonic continues their hertiage of producing excellent proforming blu-ray players, the BD55 is perhaps the best blu-ray player on the market for its price range and the best blu-ray player that Panasonic has made so far. Sony again can't reach Panasonic's level of expertise of blu-ray players. Sony should learn from them. Below are the pros and cons of both players. Pros S550 Excellent Build Quality. Excellent Onscreen Display (Video bitrate, Video codec, audio codec, etc) Very Good PQ. Very Good Audio. Decent DVD Upscaling. Quiet Fan. Quiet BD Drive. Good loading times. BD55 Very Good Build Quality. Excellent PQ. Good DVD Upscaling. Excellent Audio. Fast BD Drive. Fast loading time. Quiet Fan. CONS S550 No Frame by frame option. Some people say that Sony uses an inferior blu-ray processing chip this year instead of using the Sigma chip which is consider better in PQ. BD55 Does not have a detailed On-Screen display as the S550. Frame by frame controls do not work good. UPDATE 1: Second comparison on post #7. UPDATE 2: Added the TV that I used for the PQ comparison.</Content>
