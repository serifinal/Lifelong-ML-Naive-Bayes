		<Content>OK as we know so far there is two series of the 2008 plasma?s the PN50A550 and the PN50A750T...and that the 750 series are the top of the line elite models. Now there could be considerable picture quality difference to want to make you jump from one or the other, still no word on the price for the 750 series it will be more then the 550 series how much more between the two series may expose quality difference the 750 holds. So far specification wise what I know straight from Samsung is that, panels are the same, verified twice, contrast the 30k, brightness same, and all other specs, Two new feature on the 750 called ? Transparent Opeg Color Process?and it will have ACE-2- silhouette editor?and will not have the 3D feature that the 550 will carry, Now that makes me question just how valuable or good is the 3D option, to not even Qualify? (OH I hope the 550 is not bad), into the 750. WHY would they not just make it 3d ready why, that answer must be answered by questioning the 3D feature. Is it a handicap for the display? is the 550 as good as Samsung showed it to be in CESshow? Is the 750 just a small upgrade with a not so popular color red design around the outside edges like the lcds And yes the price difference will tell all. ? now the 550 is selling at 1600 on the internet with 400 delivery. Best buy 2199. now if the 750 ?release date may-comes out at 400 more that can still make me want to stay with the 550 and the 3D with the plane black on the outside rather then the red design. But if it come out at 900 more to higher, that will make me think of jumping ship or at least take the new features it has into more consideration. Final.</Content>
