		<Content>I set all my mains to a 100hz cutoff point, but I have no idea what I should set the LFE to. I own an Onkyo HTIB system, which offers a more adjustable speaker setup menu. Some I heard let you choose speakers to be set to small, or large and that is all you have to do when it comes to adjusting the frequancies. I wished it was that easy using my receiver.</Content>
