		<Content>Hey guys, Penteo is finally coming together as my full time job. Just this week I filed the paperwork for LLC incorporation and got the space at the October Audio Engineering Society show in San Francisco. I'll be showing both Penteo and Sontrio, the 3-point surround subset of Penteo. I'm also working on pulling together an event for the Saturday night at a well-known San Francisco disco, to demonstrate 1970s and 80s classic dance music in 3-point surround. As always, thanks to all of you who have downloaded demos and given feedback. -John</Content>
