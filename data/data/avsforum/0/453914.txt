		<Content>Introduction... After a year and a half in my house, I've finally started in my home theater and finally found the perfect name... The Dark Knight Theater It started out with just as just a cool name, but has slowly morphed into the theater's theme. I'm putting the theater in my walkout basement, which has already been framed with 2x6's. The existing raw dimensions of the room are approximately 13'6" wide by 22'6" long by 10' high. Here is the basic floor plan: This is an ongoing project.

Generally, you should avoid having the drivers point directly into the seating locations. If you do, an 1" of fiberglass board ( like OC703) can be placed in front of the sub's driver. These drivers create HF artifacts as a result of their operation. These artifacts can lead to subwoofer localization ... something you want to avoid. Comb Filtering: The audible impact of comb filtering is very unequal frequency response within critical frequency ranges. The same sound from two different speakers will cross paths, and, when they do, you'll have some frequencies cancelled (180 degrees out of phase) and other frequencies augmented (in phase) plus all the variations in between. These cancellations/augmentations will be inconsistent throughout the room. Isolation: Reducing noise entering a space and reducing noise leaving that space to adjoining rooms is NOT mutually exclusive, nor did I say that. My point is the REAL reason sound isolation should be employed in dedicated rooms is to reduce the noise floor IN the room. The fact those efforts assist in reducing noise levels OUTSIDE the room should be considered a bonus. There are some differences between the two efforts. First, a significant cause of high noise floors in a room are a result of the noise brought into the room by the A/V installer or home owner ... the equipment. Other in room sources of noise include HVAC noise. The remainder is noise entering the room from the outside which needs to be eliminated. Second, if the sound track is at 75dB in the room, and ambient noise levels outside the room are at 35dB, you have a 40dB problem to solve. If the ambient noise in the room (from outside sources) is 35dB, you have a 13dB problem to solve. Don't get excited ... that sounds easi er than it is and when we say 'noise floor' the metric is either NC or NR which are weighted curves across a broad spectrum of frequencies. The desired standard for noise transmission from inside a room to the adjoining spaces is the theater should not increase the ambient noise level outside the room by more than 3 dB SPL Show me your...: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=978755 Sound isolation:Basic Principles: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showpost.php?p=4440751&postcount=5 http://www.greengluecompany.com/a-SoundproofingTopic.php http://www.soundproofingcompany.com/index.php?/library/articles/elements_of_room_construction NC20 discussion: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=14615232#post14615232 Double 5/8" drywall with green glue, stagger seams Quasi staggered-stud construction for walls Solid doors with weatherstripping and automatic thresholdshttp://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1063385 http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=668073 http://www.greengluecompany.com/soundproofingDoors.php http://store.soundproofingcompany.com/product_p/automtic_door_bottom.htm http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=14988647 http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1096280 http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1050814 Homemade plugs for windows RSIC V clips for ceiling- http://www.soundproofingcompany.com/index.php?/products/clips/clips_installationWith 25 gauge resilient channel.

Drywall InfoTed White- "Generally first layer is horizontal, second vertical to stagger seams.Found out later that this also helps with so that the coincidence resonance is different for each layer, which is a very good thing. Start with 1 layer on ceiling, then 1 layer on wall. Then ceiling, then wall. Screws on first layer can be shorter than second layer. Generally most people seem to get a screw that will sink 1" into stud . That's more than plenty." (1-1/2" for first layer, 2" for second layer) You only need screws that are 1/2" longer than the thickness of the drywall if you are attaching it to 25-gauge resilient channel. (1-1/4" for first layer, 1-3/4" for second layer). Don't go too long or the screw may hit the wood, which would lower the efficiency of the clips and track. hanging: http://archive2.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=731185 https://72.52.223.187/xcart/product.php?productid=541&cat=93&page=1&js=n http://www.drywallschool.com/protips.htm Wallsfabric panel stretcher bar source: https://www.utrechtart.com/dsp_view_product.cfm?classId=1317&subclassID=131713&brandnam e=Best&item=26128 http://www.frenchcanvas.com/standard_stretcher_bar.asp http://www.frenchcanvas.com/extra_heavy_duty_studio_stretcher_bars.asp fabric: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1059488 fabric vendor: http://www.silentsource.com/acousticore-colorchart3.html panels: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=768967 electric boxes: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=907750 columns: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=800308 Stage Keep at least 1/4" away from walls.

Once they lined up ok (and I do mean ok.. its not great) I used the "Auto-Blend Layers" feature which, I have to say, worked fantastically on the first try.
