		<Content>Hi, I have some questions regarding the difference between paradigm monitor v5 and studio v4. I have the following speakers at front : -paradigm monitor 11 v5 -paradigm centrer cc-390 v5 Now, my questions : 1) Will I see a big difference in sound if I traded them for studio 60 (v3 or v4) and cc-570v3 (or cc-590v4) 2) If i decide only to change my center for a cc-570 (or cc-590)does the timbre matching between speakers will still be good ? Please note that i'm only using those speakers for Home Theater, not to listen music. Thanks in advance. Ben PS. Sorry for my poor english i'm from Quebec</Content>
