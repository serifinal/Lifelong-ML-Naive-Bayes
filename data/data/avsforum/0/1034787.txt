		<Content>Hey everyone I have a Samsung SyncMaster T220HD HDTV/monitor (TOC series) that I bought new a few months ago. The problem I am having has to do with the PQ when using HDMI via Xbox 360 and PS3. Let me explain in detail: Basically I got the monitor because it had 2 HDMI inputs and a DVI input (for my computer). I must say that the DVI input looks amazing and crisp but the HDMI input looks really bad with both the 360 and the PS3. The picture is way overly saturated and there is some weird artifacting/aliasing on images. It almost looks like the sharpness is turned all the way up even though I turned it all the way down. In Halo 3 any enemy that was far away was almost indistinguishable due to jaggies and even things close on the screen had extra jaggies. I was rather upset so I plugged in via the Xbox 360 vga adapter and was amazed at how good the picture was compared to the same image via HDMI. The enemies that were indistinguishable before now look really good with smooth outlines and no extra sharpness/jaggies. The colors were also more rich and less overly vibrant. It almost looks as good as the DVI image. The PS3 unfortunately shares the same problems that the 360 does via HDMI. Now this would not be a huge problem if there were two VGA inputs and the PS3 could output via VGA. But, since both of those are a negative, I am stuck with my 360 games looking amazing and my PS3 games/Blu-ray movies looking sub par. The component cables also look like crap with the PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii. In fact if something is 480p like the Wii it is almost unplayable which looks fine on my parents Samsung 40in 720p DLP. What is going on here? Does my monitor's panel not display HDMI images well? If so why would VGA and DVI look so good? Things I have tried: Used different HDMI cables (which I know wouldn't cause this, digital is digital) Used a myriad of different settings on the monitor tried all the settings on the 360 and PS3 possible (RGB colors, ect.) Switched between 1080p, 720p and 1080i on both machines Things I haven't tried: HDMI to DVI cable for the PS3. ?</Content>
