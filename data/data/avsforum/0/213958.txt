		<Content>CURRENT PROGRESS: Finally some change! I still have a lot of 'touch up' to do, but we've already moved some stuff down. After moving one couch down, I'm thinking the new (still unused) couch I bought a year or so ago for the theater will not fit down the stairs (tight corner). Looks like I'll have to sell and get some "theater seats" like W00lly! The front room that's still movie friendly. __________________________________________________ After talking to the finace about wanting my own "home theater", she's finally given me the "okay", however, there is a catch... The spare space in the basement will be a play room for my daughter (It'll look more adult-like though, I hope). Anyway, today the framing started down in the basement. I was originally going to do it myself, however, I got a couple quotes on what it would cost just for someone else to do the framing (I'm doing most of the rest). The first quote came back at just over $3,100 for just for the job and material (wood). Knowing that seemed high, I waited for the second quote to come back. The second one was $675 for everything (metal studs) or $9xx for wood. I was looking to go with metal studs for several reasons, so I chose that. After looking at the cost of materials, some of the tools I don't have and paying my soon-to-be brother in-law to help out a little and most of all, my time, I figured I wouldn't have saved any money if I did it myself. Today the crew came in and worked 4 hours and got most of the work done. They are due back this weekend to finish up the rest. I'm not aiming to have a theater that looks like you're actually at a nice theater. I am really aiming for something like Landshark's sweet setup I just want a decicated room that still makes me feel like I'm at home. A clean look with no wires showing is what I like most. I also didn't want all the annoying lights from equipment to bug me while I'm watching a movie (not to mention the noise of an Xbox360), so everything will be in a separate closet (with an IR extender). This is the plan anyway... I am very open to any other idea's, thoughts, suggestions as I can't think of everything. If you have any constructive input, please share! I am going to go with a 100" screen (not sure which one yet) and an Epson 1080UB. Here is a quick sketch I did late one night with Google Sketch Up. For the most part, the deminsions are correct, but the shape is a little off and I haven't added in the closet (I have it, but it's on another computer. At this point, I was just trying to visualize what I can do with what I have to work with (maing room will be about 11'6" x 24'). I'll run wire to where the sub box (pictured) is sitting and another one up front so I have options for sub placement. Here's the work they did today. I plan to do almost everything after the framing is done. Screen area Back of theater Where the "COMM" closet will be. The "play room" for my daughter... In a few years. Back of the play room and storage area. Nothing much right now, but should be fun to play some COD4 soon!</Content>
