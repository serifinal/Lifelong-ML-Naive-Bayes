		<Content>I know there was another thread about the A850, but I didn't see an "official owner's thread" so I thought I'd go ahead and start it. Maybe the two threads can be merged. I just brought home a LN52A850 this evening. I've not had a chance to mess with the settings or calibrations, but I thought this would be a good place for owners to start posting settings and tweaks. I will get some pics up as soon as possible. I'll also give my impressions of this TV and try to review it as best as possible. This TV was replacing an older model Sony RPT and I also have a 40XBR2 for comparison sake.

Learn More Touch of Color Bezel Inspired by designs from the automotive and fashion industries, Samsung&#8217;s unique unique Transparent and Opaque Color molding process creates a clean, smooth finish infused with a hint of a translucent color during the manufacturing process for an ultra-sleek appearance. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- InfoLink Up-to-the-minute access to weather, news, sports and stock information is just a cable and a click away through the HDTV&#8217;s Ethernet port and new InfoLink RSS service. An all-new user interface with digital contents management guide provides intuitive navigation and access to both internal and external content. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Auto Motion Plus 120Hz This technology doubles the frame rate from 60 to 120 frames per second (120Hz LCD panel) without repeating the same image to make more frames. Instead, the TV intelligently calculates the &#8216;middle&#8217; image between frame A and frame B and inserts it in between (Auto Motion Plus 120Hz processor), making a fluid transition from one frame to the next. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Super Clear Panel Samsung enhances the clarity of select LCD HDTVs by replacing the light-diffusing plastic face of traditional LCD HDTVs with a natural black panel with a clear anti-glare shield. Reduced reflection of external light creates a new dimension in image clarity, highlighting black and darkened areas, enabling vibrant, more compelling colors and a brighter, clearer picture. Black will never again appear grayish. Black details will show in vivid black even in dark scenes. The latest version of Samsung&#8217;s breakthrough super clear panel technology makes colors appear more vibrant and blacks even deeper than ever. Enhanced films reduce glare and optimize off-angle viewing. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 50,000:1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio 50,000:1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio will give you a picture better than you ever thought possible, with whiter whites, blacker blacks and a nearly infinite subtlety of gradations in between. As two of the most important determining factors in overall picture quality, contrast and brightness levels achieve new heights in this latest generation LCD panel. Samsung&#8217;s new LCD TV&#8217;s give the most stunning realistic picture quality ever. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Full HD 1080P Full HD, or 1080p, contains 1.5 times more scanning lines than conventional HD TVs. More scanning lines mean more pixels, more details and a better picture. The new Samsung LCD TV with resolution that is approximately 2 times greater than conventional HDTVs, creating the most perfect picture imaginable. Samsung&#8217;s 1080p panel uses a new high-speed liquid crystal to cut response time to 4ms. The fast response time, coupled with Samsung&#8217;s Auto Motion Plus 120Hz motion blur reduction technology dramatically reduces motion blur and judder. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Digital Natural Image Engine DNIe The Samsung Digital Natural Image engine. This exclusive Samsung technology dramatically improves the picture by enhancing the contrast, detail, white balance and reduces. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Wide Color Enhancer/Cold Cathode Flourescent Lamp The NTSC (National Television Systems Committee) has established the color standards all TVs in America try to meet. And typical LCD TVs only meet about 72% of this standard. Samsung LCD HDTVs use Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp backlights to give you 92% coverage of the NTSC standard, ensuring truer, more breathlessly vivid colors. Samsung&#8217;s exclusive Wide Color Enhancer technology delivers more brilliant colors, even in bright areas of the picture where blues and greens are washed out on conventional screens. The system displays wider color reproduction, showing you truer colors &#8211; the fresh green of spring foliage, the intense blue of the summer sky. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Connectivity Samsung has incorporated advanced HD connectivity and networking capabilities that expand the HDTV&#8217;s functionality. A wide variety of multimedia devices can be connected to the set through any one of the four Simplay compliant HDMI 1.3 inputs (including one on the side), and the handy HDMICEC feature lets you control all your CEC-enabled peripherals using just one remote. Connect HD digital devices like disc players, game consoles, and satellite dish components into the 2 rear connections and use the side-mounted input for cameras, camcorders, and laptops. HDMI is the best performing interface for displaying an HD source on an HDTV. Once connected, users can easily access device menus and manage and display content through the newly redesigned Wheel Key Remote control and the HDTV&#8217;s sophisticated content management interface. All Connections HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface version 1.3): 4 (3 rear/1 side) Ethernet port Component video: 2 (Y, Pb, Pr) S-Video input: 1 rear/1 side A/V inputs: 1 side/1 rear PC Inpuy (D-Sub): 1 RF antenna inputs: 2 HDMI-CEC Premium audio: Improved sound quality with dedicated low-range speaker system Headphone jack -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) You already know something about digital living. There&#8217;s the TV and digital video recorder in your family room. (And another set in your bedroom.) You have a PC and digital printer in your office, along with a network attached storage device. And you&#8217;ve copied all your music onto your portable music player and haven&#8217;t had to open a CD case for years. But getting them to talk to each other can be pretty tough. Why is it still so difficult to send digital content from one device to another? Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) is a collaboration of the world&#8217;s leading consumer electronics, PC and mobile companies that has created design guidelines for a new generation of products that can work together &#8212; no matter the brand. Think for a moment about all of the photos "locked away" on your home PC that you wish you could access while entertaining your friends and family. Now, thanks to DLNA enabled devices, a DLNA-enabled PC can be accessed from the comfort of your living room or family room via a DLNA-enabled HDTV, where you can enjoy your memories with friends and family, without having to deal with the hassle and non-intuitive "PCexperience". Or, say you recently downloaded your daughter&#8217;s birthday party video from your digital camcorder to your PC. Now you want to share it with your parents who are visiting. Without DLNA, you probably have to burn a DVD of the video or hook up the camcorder to the TV. With DLNA, you can just use your TV&#8217;s remote to call up the video on your TV. That&#8217;s it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Super Patterned Vertical Alignment Samsung&#8217;s Super Patterned Vertical Alignment (SPVA) panel provides a 178-degree viewing angle from all four axes -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Audio Features TruSurround is a patented SRS technology that solves the problem of playing 5.1 multichannel content over two speakers. TruSurround delivers a compelling, virtual surround sound experience through any two-speaker playback system, including internal television speakers and headphones. It is fully compatible with all multichannel formats up to 5.1 channels. High-quality virtual surround sound can be experienced with just the two hidden, downward-firing side-mounted 2.2-channel dome speakers built into the TV. SRS TruSurround XT technology delivers an amazing, simulated 3D effect with clear dialog and powerful bass. TruSurround XT audio also adds three audio enhancement technologies to produce an amazingly immersive sound experience. Dialog Clarity brings movie dialog into Focus during the playback of any surround-encoded material to make speech much clearer and crisper. TruBass creates incredible deep rich bass allowing a person to perceive significantly deeper, richer low bass tones that are far beyond the physical low frequency capabilities of the speaker itself. The SRS WOW feature widens the soundstage by processing standard two-channel stereo material as well as multi-channel encoded material for a dramatic improvement in the playback of any stereo audio over a two-speaker system. Stereo broadcast reception is offered for MTS and SAP with 181-channel capacity. A sound leveler keeps audio volume consistent during channel changing.</Content>
