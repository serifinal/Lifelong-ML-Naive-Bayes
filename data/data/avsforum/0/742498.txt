		<Content>I would like to start a 'Which CANON High Definition consumer camcorder?' thread. I'm doing this because information about HD consumer camcorders is widely spread across AVS. First of all PLEASE DO NOT COMPARE CAMCORDERS DISCUSSED BELOW WITH ANY OF THE HIGH END ONES such as Sony HDR-FX1, Canon XH A1S, etc, etc. Please do not discuss them here. No SD camcorders either. My knowledge and personal opinion is based on what I managed to read out from many reviews and opinions written at AVS forums and other. I am starting this thread because I am in need of buying a new camcorder. For the past few years I've been filming Actions sports with my 1 chip SD camcorder and a Century Optics MKII Baby Death (37mm thread). Recently I bought a Full HD TV and I have decided to shoot in HD either. From the information I gathered Canon's products seem to be the best decision. Unfortunatelly I have a couple issues to consider. Canon has 3 types of HD consumer camcorders right now. HF series- with flash memory HG series- with a hard disk HV series- miniDV To make things more understandable. Picture Quality: hf11=hg20=hg21 (max 24mbps) Hf100 and hf10 end up @ 17 mbps 24 mbps allows higher detail to be retained in any panning or moving shots. With only 17 mbps, detail is dropped during any motion. However I also read that the detail that's 'dropped', tends to be very fine detail, most people wouldn't notice the difference. Both HG and HF record in AVCHD. Which format to choose is just not a simple answer at this stage of development. AVCHD uses MPEG4 which has a much better compression algorithm than MPEG2. Avchd uses h.264, which is an mpeg4 variant. HDV right now is easier to edit (Seems that AVCHD is superior in PQ, and so do many others, when comparing AVCHD 24Mbps to HDV Tape Based Footage) The HF11/10/100 all have a better processor than the HV30/20 line...Also a better CMOS chip for the hf11 ( HV30 1/2.7" vs HF11 1/3.2" ) On the other hand the crispness and lack of noise of the HV30 is very impressing and serves as a reminder that the AVCHD codec still has a ways to go before it can match HDV for unwanted compression artifacting. Artifacting increases as data rate decreases. It is a function of the compression algorithm. In actuality AVCHD specs out at 1920X1080 and HDV at 1440X1080. Both have the same vertical pixel resolution, the difference is in the theoretical horizontal pixel resolution. Now a slight comparison between three of Canon's top consumer models hg21 - viewfinder, HDD, PRICE, AVCHD (37mm thread) hf11 - no viewfinder smaller, cheaper than HG21, Flash, AVCHD (37 mm thread) hv30 - viewfinder, miniDV ('Tapes are going to die soon.'?!) (43 mm thread-need step dwon ring to use Bdeath) Canon HG21 is nearly identical to the Canon HG20, but includes a viewfinder, upgraded LCD, and larger 120GB hard drive. I must say that the viewfinder is a good solution in some circumstances. - You seem to be able to hear the hum of the hard drive on the recording (hg20/21) but I doubt whether it's louder than the miniDV motor noise. I might get myself an external microphone if needed in both cases. The last thing I need to add here are my computer specs. I'm not new to video editing. Currently trying out Premiere CS4. Hp Pavilion dv9700 Notebook PC Intel Core 2 Duo T9300 @ 2.50 GHz 2 gb of ram (can expand to 4 gb) Geforce 8600M GS 512mb Vista 64 bit When buying this computer this summer I was thinking about editing footage on it, thought it was a good idea? Any comments.. Looking through topics I found this statement.. 'You'll feel better about avchd by the end of next year, the computer hardware will be much cheaper than it is now... we went through this exact same scenario when minidv first hit the scene, the computers were way too slow to handle it, and now nobody remembers how bad it was.' Please help, tell me Your opinions. I will aprreciate, Everybody interested in buying an HD consumer camcorder will appreciate. Which one to choose ?</Content>
