		<Content>hi everyone... first off, wanted to say hi and tell you all how wonderful this forum is, since i am a newbie here... so here is what's going on... i am moving into a new house and my parents are getting me a pioneer 5010fd plasma, which i am soooo excited about... now comes the audio... to be honest, i am on a budget of about $600-$800 (more towards the lower end) and wanted to get something nice... i know a decent amount about home theaters as i have designed my fathers $20,000 system... the reason why i state this is that i have realized that quality is MUCH more important than quantity.. for the longest time, i thought that i would get a onkyo htib, which are great little things in this budget, but i have started to think that it may not be the wisest investment... it would be nice to have something to build on to in the future... so here is what i am thinking of, either a 2.1 or 3.1 system for now.... so let it start... what can you guys come up with me for that price range in what i am looking for (just speakers and a/v receiver)... ideally, i would like to have some floorstanding speakers that look nice (of course, b&w is out of my range)... i was thinking of something from kef or klipsch... so please, ALL suggestions are needed... i have a couple questions keeping the above in mind: 1. will i actually need a 3.1 system for now (vs. just 2 speakers in front)... most of my needs are movies, some video games, and only occasional music.... so for this, how will a 2.1 system do with voices in movies??? i wouldn't mind holding off on the center in order to get nicer fronts for my budget, IF it can do a good job of delivering for movies.... would the a/v receiver just need to be put into a ghost mode or something without a center channel?? 2. after haivng spent $600-800 on a 2.1 or 3.1 system, will it sound better than an htib... i know this may sound like a stupid question because the quality of the speakers and receiver will be much better, but i am asking about the overall experience... i.e. will i miss out on the surround from the satellites when watching movies?? will i feel like only 2/3 speakers aren't filling the room and just giving a directional/front sound?? just to give you a general idea, the living room is about 20x20.. 3. i hope that the above has given you guys some idea of what i am looking for... conisdering this, is my approach ok to ditch the htib?? thanks to everyone in advance and i look forward to hearing from you....</Content>
