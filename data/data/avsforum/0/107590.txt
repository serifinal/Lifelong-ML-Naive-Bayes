		<Content>OK, if someone is able to help me recover my mother-in-law's Replay shows, she'll be very happy. She may even seek you out and give you a kiss or two! My MIL's 5516 experienced the dreaded "Please Wait..." coma and I've been asked to help since I know a thing or two about them thar PeeCees. I referenced the handful of helpful Replay TV sites (Planet Replay, ReplayTV Upgrades, Replay FAQs, etc.) and attempted to grab the TV shows off of the Replay drive, if at all possible. Here's what I did to reach this point of desperation: - I attached the drive to my test XP machine to the Master channel of the Secondary IDE; drive sounds like it booted, no grinds or clicks to wince at - Ran the latest extract_rtv5.exe (v75), but it did not find a ReplayTV drive - Peeked into Windows Disk Management utility to see if the drive was hooked up...yep, it's listed as "Disk 2, Basic, 152.66GB, Online, Unallocated" - Googled around and said, "Son of ..." after I discovered that the above step was highly unrecommended. - Ran RTVPatch_2.5.3 and saw that the drive was listed, but with a yellow exclamation point and the discouraging words, "NOT a ReplayTV Disk". - Found a post on the AVS archive that describes a painful, gut-wrenching, LINUX-lingo-laden process to repair the Replay partition if the above takes place. Is there any way to fix the Replay drive WITHOUT having to resort to using LINUX?? I have zero experience with LINUX and don't really feel like experimenting with at this point, but, if it's the only choice... So, is there any hope with a Windows based solution here or is LINUX the only way to go? Thanks, jawgee</Content>
