		<Content>Update as of 12-15-08. This screen is "done", here are 4 complete pictures: Updated 3-22-09: Finally made manual masking panels to view 16:9 material, link here, pict added below Manual masking panel for 2.35:1 screen for 16:9 viewing This link should take you to the Lessons Learned/Things Done Right/Things Done Wrong/What to do next time post. Includes: -Itemized BOM and budget summary -Alternate ways to build this, what I'd do -Calculations used so anyone could do this easily "I am the Kung Fu Panda, Ska-doosh!" One of my favorite shots from Cars: Manual masks in place for 16:9 viewing: Below text is from original 1st post, un-edited. I mentioned in &#8220;Talontsi96&#8221; build thread Birth of a DIY Curved Screen (AT Grey) that I was going to use his (and others) curved DIY screen framing methods as a basis for my &#8220;R&D project&#8221; of making one with structural extruded aluminum metal framing. Well, a few weeks have gone by and here is status: My work uses this structural extruded aluminum metal framing for many testing fixtures; I&#8217;ve always thought it would also make a good screen frame material. Sorta like a tinker-toy approach, std fasteners can be used, should make it easy for others who want alternative to a wood frame for whatever their reason. You can cut this stuff with carbide saw blade, easy workability. No welding. Now, with my HT project is the time to actually do something. After speaking to the test technicians and the guy who designs their test jigs, he pointed me to their website,http://www13.boschrexroth-us.com/framing_shop/ . You've might have seen this stuff in manufacturing workcells or test labs, etc: Neat stuff, easy to order, lots of choices - too many if just looking at the catalog. http://www13.boschrexroth-us.com/Fra...category=10101 Our work uses the larger sizes for jigs and test fixtures, 40mmx40mm and larger, however I felt 20mmx20mm should suffice for a static loaded DIY 2.37:1 curved screen frame. This was also based on a meeting I had with their sales rep, nice guy, he informed me many of the large commercial screens use their stuff. Here is x-section image from website: Basic image is the frame itself will be solid/rigid foundation, then I will attach 1 x 4 pine board and put the correct curve per AussieBob&#8217;s calc sheet. Sounds simple - I expect roadblocks but that's part of the journey. My goal is DIY 128" diag curved 2.37:1 screen, with DW laminate as the screen material, due to young kids. When the kids are older, I'll use the frame as base for AT screen with speakers behind. I calculated the metal framing portion weight to be just under 11lbs., that's about what the pieces/fasteners I have weigh. Additional weight from using 1 x 4 pine boards and the DW laminate will be added. I have the material at home, next weekend (Memorial weekend) this is my DIY project. Stay tuned. I'll post picts as this project matures. I've seen other people here using sq alum tubing, but never this extruded structural alum stuff, if others have done this before post that link, I could not find any.</Content>
