		<Content>Looks like i am going to have to start the thread on this product. No frills, no OSD, no Multi-Eq, allegedly great sound from the Class D amps. The big question are those digital amps as good or better than in the SA-XR55 in this 11lb. midget? Could they break the "Ice"? Sorry, had to give one under the belt What got me right away is that its depth is only 12" unlike the SA-XR700 which expands backwards to keep slim. My Sony XBR910 only allows max 13" depth on the A/V shelf, no other HD receiver of the current crop can fit in there. Relatively light, yet it did well in some reviews, as you would expect from a basic HD decoding receiver, biamping/biwiring included. Trilingual notes on the back, likely reflecting the expected mix of users, as EU regulations require Manual: http://service.us.panasonic.com/OPERMANPDF/SABX500.PDF Reviews: http://www.trustedreviews.com/home-c...AV-Receiver/p1 http://www.homecinemachoice.com/revi...asonic+sabx500 SA-BX500 Power Output Power Output at 20Hz-20kHz Each Ch.

This replaces it, i have nothing but high expectations. Will post impressions. Don't get me wrong though, i am still keeping my balanced separates system in the basement 3 row HT</Content>
