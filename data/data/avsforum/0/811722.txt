		<Content>I just bought the 1080UB. The convergence is definatly off. One green here, one red here, etc. Esentially - all the lines on the grid have a red/green companion - probably about one pixel each. I guess my question is how picky should i be? How perfect should I expect that it can be before sending it back. Thanks much</Content>
