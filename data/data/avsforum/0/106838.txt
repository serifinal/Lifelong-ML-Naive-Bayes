		<Title>Help with using my Pioneer VSX-92TXH's IR IN jack, and the IR OUT</Title>

		<Content>I have a Pioneer Elite VSX-92TXH which is partially obscured by the cabinet it sits in. Oddly enough the cabinet door is partially glass, but the beam of wood which runs in the middle of it obscures the IR receiver on the front. So, I'd like to run an external IR receiver out of the cabinet near the TV. Now I thought this would be pretty easy, since the receiver provides an IR IN jack in the back in the form of a 3.5mm plug. So I bought a SpeakerCraft IRC-2.0 since it's nice and small and relatively cheap. It has a four conductor 3.5mm jack. However, this doesn't work at all to control the receiver. It does not receive any commands, and it does not even shut off the front panel input (something the manual indicated it would, or at least take precedence over). I also happen to have a Smarthome IR linc: http://www.smarthome.com/2411R/IRLin...nverter/p.aspx This also happens to have a 3.5mm 3 conductor IR receiver attached to it, so I tried that one on the VSX-92TXH as well. No luck there either. Pioneer was NO help in this matter, the CS agent would not even tell me what the correct pin out for the jack was (!?) and could not tell me any particular brand or model of IR receiver that would work. I know I could go all out and get a IR terminator block and repeaters and probably get it working that way, but that seems like a lot of extra cost and clutter I could avoid of I could just get my receiver to function as it does in the manual. Anyone have any advice they could give me? Does ANYONE use this feature on their Pioneer receiver? Thanks for your help!</Content>
