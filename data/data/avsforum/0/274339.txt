		<Content>the calibration thread for this tv is ridiculously cluttered and seems to be a battle of opinions rather than actual calibration settings. can someone please direct me to the most popular calibration settings for this tv? it's such a popular tv someone out there has to have had it calibrated professionally and posted their settings? anyone have a quick link so i don't have to read through mountains of confusing posts? thanks.</Content>
