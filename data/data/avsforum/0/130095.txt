		<Content>DIYer Turns Tragedy into Home Theater By Rachel Cericola Vincent Bova's wait before brain surgery gave birth to a new hobby -- and a business opportunity. Three years ago, Vincent Bova didn?t have a home theater. Life was busy, with his job on Wall Street, his wife Jennifer, 2-year-old Nikolette, and a new home. He did have the bug, though. ?I was fascinated with home theater, but also very intimidated by it,? Vincent says. ?My knowledge over the years was very technical, but it was more computer-based.?
