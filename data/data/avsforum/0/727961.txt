		<Content>All, I purchased a home in July that was wired for sound. The speakers in the BR stopped working recently. I have played with the connections to the receiver and everything seems to be working properly there. Is there a way to test whether the signal is reaching my speakers to determine if the problem is my speaker or the wire? Thanks.</Content>
