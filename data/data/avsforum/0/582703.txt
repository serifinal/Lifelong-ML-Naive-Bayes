		<Content>Hi everyone -- I hope you guys can help me out. I'm rather new to a more technical analysis of LCD's and I'm at a loss. I want a high-end 52" LCD TV. Because I have a lot of ambient light in my living room, I have decided to go with Sony, not Samsung. I went to the local Howards and saw the w4100. It looked fine. The recent CNET review about the fluctuating blacks, however, worries me. That's probably my only concern. Now I've seen the news that xbr6 will come out in 52". My understanding is that xbr6 is similar to the z4100 from a tech standpoint, in that it has an LCD backlight. Here are my 2 questions: 1) What advantage does an LCD backlight provide? I could not find images online but does anyone have a description or an image comparison? 2) Of course the xbr6 is better than the w4100, but how much better is it? Will the images produced be so noticeably different that I would hands down pick an xbr6, or are they marginal? I would be watching HDTV 60% of the time, DVD's 30% of the time and videogames 10% of a time on an Xbox. Hope this wasn't a repost. Pardon the ignorance and thanks!</Content>
