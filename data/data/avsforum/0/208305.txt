		<Content>Hi, This is all new for me, but I am desperate for help and seeking the expertise of those on this forum. I have been trying to build a home theater system with a pc and ps3 connected to an HDTV. It will primarily be used for gaming. I have ordered all of the parts except for the speaker system. I am looking for a 7.1 speaker system that can be used for my tv, pc, and ps3 at the same time. I find the audio-side of things to be very confusing. From what I understand, uncompressed pcm is what to shoot for. I want a system that can handle this. I know a lot of the systems I looked at before only had hdmi pass-thru when it comes to audio. I didn't know whether it would be best to use the sound from my ati 4870 graphics card or the onboard 7.1 audio. I figured I could connect from the 4870 using hdmi and still get 7.1 sound. I have ordered a Philips 47PFL7403D/27. I have the following computer: CPU: Intel? Core?2 i7-920 2.66 GHz 8M L3 Cache LGA1366 COOLING FAN : Asetek Liquid CPU Cooling System (Extreme Cooling Performance + Extreme Silent at 20dBA) MOTHERBOARD: MSI X58 Platinum Intel X58 Chipset SLI/CrossFireX Mainboard Triple-Channel DDR3/1600 SATA RAID w/ eSATA, Dual GbLAN, USB2.0, IEEE1394a, &7.1Audio MEMORY: 3GB (3x1GB) PC1333 DDR3 PC3 10666 Triple Channel Memory VIDEO CARD: ATI Radeon HD 4870 PCI-E 16X 512MB DDR5 Video Card HARD DRIVE: Single Hard Drive (1TB (1TBx1) SATA-II 3.0Gb/s 32MB Cache 7200RPM HDD) Optical Drive: LG 20X DVD?R/?RW + CD-R/RW DRIVE DUAL LAYER Optical Drive 2: 16X DVD ROM (BLACK COLOR) SOUND: HIGH DEFINITION ON-BOARD 7.1 AUDIO OS: Microsoft? Windows Vista? Home Premium (64-bit Edition) I am trying to get a system before Christmas. My overall price range is $300-$550. Thanks in advance for all the help. It will be truly appreciated.</Content>
