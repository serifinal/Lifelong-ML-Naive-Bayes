		<Content>My set seems to have a bit of overscan, more noticeable on some channels (HD cable) than others. Noticed during the election, that some of the outermost numbers shown on NBC-HD were cut off, and I've noticed text that is close to the edges of the screen may be truncated, although most everything else looks okay and not too obvious. I know how to get in the service menu, but didn't see anything that looked like an adjustment for overscan. Is that even adjustable on this set? I can live with it, but I'm a geek and like to get the best from my "toys." Many thanks.</Content>
