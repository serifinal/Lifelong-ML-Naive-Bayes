		<Content>Ok so I am at the final phase of my framing (only soffits left). I dont have such a huge problem with my side walls, since they are concrete and with blanketed insulation all the way around, and my whole basement is less than 650 sqft so it will serve as my entire home theater area. So I wont be using RSIC or DD/GG-ing my side walls since I wont have to worry about adjacent rooms, only the floor above (which is the first floor with kitchen/dining/living areas - bedrooms are on second floor) Now my dilema lies in whether I should Double-drywall the entire ceiling surface wall to wall with Green Glue. It will cost me about $450 to get 3 cases of 12 tubes to properly cover about 600 sqft or more of ceiling area, plus another $100 in additional drywall. My only reservation is How much of an immediate and noticable benefit am I getting my spending another $550 on green glue and additional drywall, over just doing a single 5/8" layer of drywall and overstuffing the joists with insulation? The other issue that comes into place is that many people spend 100's of dollars on DD/GG-ing their ceiling but then they end up with 10-20 open areas from recessed lights and supply/return air vents where the sound still escapes through the DD/GG insulated ceiling, and we're back to square one after spend close to $600 to prevent this from happening. Can someone please advise? Its not just about the extra money, its also about the extra time and effort needed to DD/GG the ceiling, and the fact the DD/GG layer will be EXTREMELY heavy and will just be a pain in the neck and back to install onto ceiling, even with a drywall lift.</Content>
