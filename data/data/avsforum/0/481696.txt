		<Content>I am pretty much an HD Tech novice, but am learning. A little background info...within the last year I have purchased the Samsung HP-T4254 42" Plasma TV and I just purchased the Samsung BD-P1500 Blu-Ray player this evening. I also purchased an HDMI cable to connect the two for best audio/visual quality. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the beautiful picture of my HDTV, especially with sports...just amazing. I decided to get the Blu-Ray Player to watch my movies in HD spectacularness as well. I am currently watching a Blu-Ray movie in the Blu-Ray player via the HDMI connection and the colors are beautiful. The only issue is I feel like I am seeing a bit of visual noise/pixelation. Questions: Is this because my HDTV is only 720p? What should I expect visually if I have a 720p HDTV and am trying to watch Blu-Ray movies on it? Is there anything I can do, any settings I can adjust on my HDTV and/or Blu-Ray player to rid myself of the visual noise? Lastly, am I just being too critcal of the visual performance? I just feel like when I go into a Best Buy and see their Blu-Ray demo setup the picture of the HDTV is noise free. Any insight would be appreciated!!!</Content>
