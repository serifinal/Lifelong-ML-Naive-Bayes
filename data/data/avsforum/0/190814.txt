		<Content>Well, after the "Great Erase" that AVS had a few months ago, I have finally had time to re-post my thread: Below I will post all of [i]my[i] old posts and then take it from where I left off. Post #1: Aug. 4, 2008 04:45 PM Well after about 6 months of research and countless hours reading threads here on AVS, I am ready to begin my own journey into the home theater world. Here is a little background on my space: - 8ft foundation walls (This means its in the basement. Here in Wisconsin, you consider your basement to be part of your home, not just storage space) - Will include a small bar. Probably dry, but the hook ups for a wet bar are available to that is still an option. -Also includes 10' X 12' "Bedroom" (No egress window so it will actually be a bonus room that happens to have a bed in it), and a full bath with whirlpool tub -The important stuff...what I am thinking for AV equipmant: ? Epson PowerLite Home Cinema 720 PJ ? 92" Premium Elite Tab-Tension electric screen ? Onkyo HT-S5100 7.1-Channel Home Theater Pictures and Floor Plans will come tonight. Please share any and all input (good or bad) w/ me Post #2: Aug. 5, 2008 09:14 AM Well, the 720 PJ is due to budget. Also, I have a shorter throw distace so hopefully the 720 will sufice. The Onkyo HTIB has a possiblility of being replaced with a Klipsch/Polk Audio Set Up with Klipsch Synergy III towers in the front. I have to spend some more time listening to them and see where the budget is in a few months. To everyone that checked in last night, sorry the pictures never got up. I ended up finishing my insulation and starting the rough framing last night. Give me a few hours to get a floor plan and renderings up and tonight I will post pictures of the space. Thanks! Post #3: On: 08-06-08 08:46 AM Here's the renderings and floor plan so now you don't have to click the links above: Floor Plan: Looking at the bar: (note equipment rack above bar) Looking at the screen from behind the bar: Looking at the post and screen from bottom of stairs: Birds eye view show entire basement: The walls will actually be a darker color. Sketch Up was giving me trouble with colors. I am thinking a dark rust color. All of the trim is cherry stained maple to match the rest of the house. I forgot to mention earlier that I have a 42" Fujitsu Plasma for the back bar. It is three years old but I got it free a few weeks ago and it works great and has a fantastic picture! Let me know what you think and feel free to give me any and all advice you may have</Content>
