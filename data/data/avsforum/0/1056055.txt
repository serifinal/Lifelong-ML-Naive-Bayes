		<Content>Hi all First time here .. hoping someone can help me out. I have a BenQ PB6100 projector. It`s been great for 3 years, but now I`m seeing a blue hue all over the projected image, no matter what input source I use. BenQ doesn`t have any support so I thought I`d try you guys .. Does anyone know what might cause this ? (my bulb has only 900 hrs, incidentally) I appreciate any help ! :-) Thanks, Mike NH --------------------</Content>
