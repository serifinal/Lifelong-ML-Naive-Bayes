		<Content>DIY Theater Turns Homeowner Into Installer By Krissy Rushing Jeremy Hummer had so much fun turning his garage into a dedicated home theater, he decided to change careers. The first films Jeremy Hummer saw as a child had a huge impact on what he wanted to do with his life. He was obsessed with the idea that multiple images captured on a strip of film could reproduce moving images. In the 1980s he began collecting 8mm and 16mm films and converted his bedroom into a theater, complete with actual film projectors, a screen, and a multi-speaker sound system. But film isn?t a cheap or low-maintenance date. The high cost of buying film prints and maintaining the delicate material caused Jeremy to move to Laserdisc and begin his massive video library, as well as purchase a video projector and a bona fide surround sound system. When DVD came along, Jeremy?s hobby got even more serious, only now he had a house in Gulfport, Florida, with a 500-square-foot garage. That?s when he started thinking about turning the place that once housed cars and yard tools into a true, dedicated theater. ?Remodeling the garage instead of using an existing room allowed me to design the entire project from the ground up and do it the right way architecturally, acoustically, and electrically,? says Jeremy. He hired subcontractors to do most of the construction labor, but handled the wiring and equipment installation himself, relying on a knowledge base acquired from a 10-year-long career in broadcast-television system integration.
