		<Content>CURRENT STATUS 05/11/09: 97% complete. Needs acoustic treatments & equipment room curtain. Projector & Blu-Ray player purchased and installed. Hello all! I?m going to join the fray and begin my home theater build thread, adding the hundreds (?) already here. I really wish I had come across these forums sooner, as I have been neglecting the future HT space for over a year now, due to frustrations with planning. But, life goes on, and before I knew it, a little girl is on the way. So this remodel has to get finished really quick? as the baby is taking over my office and our current TV area. Daddy is getting the boot out of the house and into the garage, but it is a better space and is a win-win scenario! Once miss junior is here, little time and money will be available to keep working on it for a while. So? let the countdown begin for February 09! You comments, advice, complaints, snide remarks, and boxes of donuts are most welcome. The area is a former two-story garage/workshop that we are converting to additional living space. My wife and I purchased the house three years ago after specifically looking for this kind of expandability. One section will be the HT, the other will be my office and studio. The second story loft above the HT will be used for storage. After completion, this will add another 520 livable square feet to our home. For purposes of this forum, I?ll keep focus on the HT area, although I?m remodeling the rest of the garage into a loft and studio space. Take a quick gander at the overhead plans with electrical and low voltage schematics?</Content>
