Once you reach 30 and the crystal in you palm turns &#8220;red&#8221; you&#8217;re time is up. Those who don&#8217;t urn up at for &#8220;renewal&#8221; are called &#8220;runners&#8221; and policing agency know as &#8220;Sandmen&#8221; hunt down runners and terminate them.

Logan&#8217;s Run (1976) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074812/ I sure hope it&#8217;s a six-track Dolby version and not a Dolby stereo 4:2:4, version. There&#8217;s also a remake baring the same title in production due for 2010 realise. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402344/</Content>
