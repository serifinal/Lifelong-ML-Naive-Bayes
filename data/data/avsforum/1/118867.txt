		<Content>We are going to make a gaming room so does anyone have any good recommendations? I would prefer to choose from TVs from BestBuy because they have alot of coupons usually... but if I can find a better deal somewhere else please let me know! I was looking at the Pioneer plasmas... Expensive but are there any good deals on them? We wouldn't want to spend over 2k I don't think. So any recommendations please keep them coming! Thanks!</Content>
