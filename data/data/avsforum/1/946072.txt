		<Content>The 750 came down in price again !but really going crazy choosing between the two(650 or 750) The price diffrence is $30 right now. Do u guys recomend the 750 over the 650 at $30 bucks? What about the halo? I've heard they now come with new angled bezels. Also about the "halo" .When i read the reviews on Amazon,com no one really talks about this problem, only here on AVS forums. Well hope to hear from u guys!!</Content>
