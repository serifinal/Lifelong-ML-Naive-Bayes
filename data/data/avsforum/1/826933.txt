		<Content>I am moving my projector (Panasonic AE2000U) to a larger room, now looking for a large (150" diagonal or marginally smaller) power retractable screen (ceiling-mounted). This will be my first screen, as so far i was just projecting on a wall. Looking for suggestions on brand / model / fabric / etc. Thanks!</Content>
