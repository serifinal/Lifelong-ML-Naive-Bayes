		<Content>Hi, I was looking around for a LCD, which brought me to this forum, and I have a dilemma, and you guys seems like a knowledgable bunch... so here it is I really had my eye set on the Samsung A650, the 32 inch, I walked pass it in big box retailer and it really caught my eye, It must be the shine My previous experience with Samsung was with a non-hd crt from a couple of years back, it was good, but I really hated the user interface, the on screen menus and the remotes especially... but since then I've been lusting after Samsung lcds ever since, with each year and new model, I really liked all of their design so far, but only until now that the price and feature, specifically 1080p becomes reasonably within my reach. So, here I was with a wad of cash in my hand running around from store to store trying to shop for the best deal, trying to look for the best dealer locally and see if I can get them so sweeten the deal And here's a guy at one dealer who's not too enthusiastic about the Samsung had shown me the latest Sony W series which is the only other 1080p around at the size that I'm looking for (32") and the Sony was $100 cheaper! and it seems that the salesman is getting a lot of commission from Sony and is prepared to sweeten the deal with further discount and a very good deal on a low-end blu-ray player, which is nice. Around my parts, there's hardly any Samsung blu-ray. I was thinking of getting a PS3 anyway but since there's hardly any game I like and it would be easier for my wife / mom to just pop the tray and press play on a proper blu-ray machine with hdmi-cec crontrol. I used to be a Sony-fanboy 10 years ago, everything I had was Sony, I'd been through it all Walkmans, Discmans, DAT, MD, DVD, It's used to be that if it's Sony, I would buy it without a thought, but in the past few years, Sony had really screwed up and I had vowed on principle not to get anymore Sony stuff ever... and here I am... Back to the LCDs, it seems like they are using the same panels am I right? so the difference in picture quality would be down to the processing engine... so what's the general consensus around here between Sony and Samsung, a lot of people seem to rave about the Samsung A650. My mind is set on the Samsung but I've never had proper experience with anything from them, whereas Sony are a known quantity. While immediately I can see things that are wrong/I don't like with the Sony (Design, Style, Proprietaryness) they seem tolerable, and it looks like a good deal, and even-though people seem to rave about the Samsung, it looks like there are also problems abound as well. So, am I lured in by the glitter of the Samsung, should I take the plunge? or stay with the safe choice of Sony? maybe I'm subconsciously conditioned by two decades of propaganda that Sony is reliable even I'm now trying hard to hate them. I'm sorry for the length,</Content>
