		<Content>All, Assuming both are the same price... which would you choose? Does either of the two do better with screen reflection/glare or IR/Burn-in. Those are my only two concerns right now. Let me know. We currently have a Panny 42" 60U in the basement and love it. Looking for a step up in the living room from our 52" JVC DILA. Mike</Content>
