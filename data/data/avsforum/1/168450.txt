		<Content>I'm about to order (tomorrow, most likely) a Sammy LN52A750 from BuyDig and the extra warranty is $159. Is it worth it? I've never bought an extended warranty on anything other than a car ($400 extra on the price of a Charger isn't much to ask). I'm not seeing any posts about problems with his monitor.</Content>
