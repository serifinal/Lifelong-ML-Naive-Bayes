		<Content>The setup - Panasonic TH-50PZ85U (50" plasma) DirectTV receiver/dvr HR21-100 Onkyo TX-SR806 AV/Receiver Panasonic DMP-BD50 Blu-Ray DVD player A pair of Norh Prism 5.2 and a Norh Prism 4.1 center speaker with a pair of old Bose for the back surround speakers. I connected the Directtv/DVR and the BD player to the receiver with HDMI and optical cables. The HDMI out on the AVR goes to HDMI1 on the TV. I have done the basic setup but am reluctant to go further since I am unsure of what I'm doing now. When I first turned on the TV after installing the Onkyo AVR, it seemed that the picture was noticeably better - even though we were blown away by the quality of the HD picture before we installed the AVR. But my understanding is that since I am using an HDMI connection, it just passes through the feed without any processing. So is it just us or is there some video processing going on? More importantly, should I do anything with the video settings on the AV receiver or just leave at whatever the default is? (I am not crystal clear on this 'progressive' or 'interlaced' format thing. I really don't know what to do with all these video setting options on the AVR) Another thing I am unsure about is THX. The manual for the SR806 gives confusing tables (for someone like me) about audio format support. The way I read it, to be able to get THX sound, it looks like I will need 6 or 7 speakers instead of the 5 I have currently. Is that correct? If anyone has a similar configuration could they advise me how I should proceed with the remainder of my setup for the Onkyo? Thanks very much. Dennis</Content>
