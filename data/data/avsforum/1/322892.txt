		<Content>I am in the process of finishing the basement in my home and I need all the help I can get. Deciding on a projector in mind boggling. I will be in the $ 2500to $ 3000 market for a projector. I need help on wiring also. Where do I need to place the outlet for the projector. Thanks, Kenny</Content>
