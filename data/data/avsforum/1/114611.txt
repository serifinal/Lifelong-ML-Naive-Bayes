		<Content>I had the 400v a couple of months ago before I returned it back to the store. The reason why I returned it is because it had grainy pq. I bought the new Sony DVP-NS700H a couple of weeks ago and returned it, because I did not like it. I had to go to 2 Best Buy stores to look and buy the 410V, because one of the stores were out of stock and my Oppo DV-983H shipped yesterday. This comparison was done on a Sharp Aquos 37 inch lcd tv (I will be buying a 42 inch tv this summer) and by memory for the Sony DVP-NS700H and 400V. The audio performace was done with HDMI and my Yamaha RX-V1800 receiver. Now here is my comparison on each dvd player, except the Oppo DV-983H since I have not received it and it would not be fair for comparing a $399 dvd player to a dvd player that costs under $100. Picture Quality and Video Performace 1. Pioneer DV-410V - The best pq against the Sony DVP-NS700H and Pio DV-400V. PQ was not grainy at all, it has a sharp and clear image. Colors looked decent. HQV testing on this dvd player was very solid. 2. Sony DVP-NS700H - Overall not as good as the DV-410, but decent. I noticed artifacts in the pq. PQ has edge enhancement that I can not get rid of and it had a somewhat grainy image. Colors as good as the DV-410. HQV testing was not as good DV-410. 3. Pioneer DV-400V - Very grainy pq, a lot of artifacts. The worst out of the two other dvd players. HQV testing was worse than the DVP-NS700H and DV-410V. Build 1. Pioneer DV-410V - Excellent build for the price. 2. Pioneer DV-400V - Good build, but not as good as the DV-410V, because there is more weight in the DV-410V. 3. Sony DVP-NS700H - Decent, but not has good as its previous model and not as good as either Pioneer dvd player as mentioned here. Audio Performace 1. Pioneer DV-410V - I feel that the HDMI audio is better with this player than the other 2 dvd players. HDMI audio is more fuller and dynamic. 2. Sony DVP-NS700H and Pioneer DV-400V - both sounded the same. Overall 1. Pioneer has done a great job on the DV-410V and they improved in all areas that I did not like about the DV-400V. 2. Sony DVP-NS700H is just a good basic dvd player. Nothing special about it. Right now I will be staying with the DV-410V but I should have waited this Friday to buy it from Best Buy because I received a 12% off coupon from the mail today, maybe they will honor the 12% off coupon this Friday. The Oppo DV-983 that I ordered will be delivered to me tomorrow. The big question is: Is the Oppo DV-983H worth the extra money from the Pioneer DV-410V?</Content>
