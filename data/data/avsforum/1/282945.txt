		<Content>Does anyone own the DVD and laserdisc and I?m sure the same goes with the other format discs. Have you found the film to be too bright on the left and right fronts? I?ve slipped in the region 2 special edition and thou I?ve listened to the film many times over before, and struggling with the high end strings of violins and violas while some portions of overlap on the centre channel (audio masking) rendering some of the detail difficult to hear. With the Behringer DCX2496 I can mute switch channels LCR around into different positions to see where the issues lie. What I found was the left channel HF was too high and lowering the level on the HF while playing back a particular scene or sequence and then resting on given level just for this film. I could use the dynamic EQ that has been disengaged since a few weeks ago now and let that tackle the issue because the left HF is in my face when the Jerry Goldsmith score cuts in. Could be balance issue when producing the film for DVD or it might be the same issue on laserdisc Dolby stereo 4:2:4 I?d have to run the PAL laserdisc to see if same amount of high frequency exists on that disc. And don?t worry I?m not going to show any beaver shots in here! I think there?s a good amount of low end if the HF was just trimmed down on all three matching LCR its not as if I?m that hard of hearing, I mean if I can hear the HF in face then a little lowering will not harm it. This is one of many scenes that, has Jerry?s score playing. The subtlety of Catherine Tramell flinging away a fag has softness against the sound of sea breeze air and wind and score as little nip on the end of her nails, in the centre channel. Foley effects and dialogue mix is okay sounding. softer musical cues have a lesser in my face when Det. Nick Curran and Gus Moran go back to Catherine Tramell house to ask her to pop along down to the station for a little questioning. The Music has moody lower beat that?s chilling now that I know who did it?</Content>
