		<Content>Hi, Just a couple of quick ones. I've decided on either the Samsung 650 or 750 LCD 52" TV. It doesn't really matter which one. I found a couple places to order: http://www.paylessplasma.com/product...?ProductID=339 and http://www.drplasma.com/productdetai...ProductID=3309 Anybody order from either of these places before? Or is there another online standby I should order from? Second thing...I know there is a stand for the 52" 650 and a different one for the 52" 750. For the life of me, I can't figure out what stand I need, and where I can order it? Any help is greatly appreciated...thanks! Dan</Content>
