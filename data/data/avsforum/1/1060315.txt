		<Content>I am new to AVS but I think this is the coolest forum I have found on the net. Anyway, to the reason why I am here. I am going to buy my first HDTV on Monday 3/5/08. I am torn up because I really like the Samsung 40A650 LCD and the Samsung 50A550 Plasma. That is a big jump in size but the prices are right at the top of my budget and I think these are awesome sets. Some pros/cons about each are below. Keep in mind that I was comparing these sets at BB, both hooked up with coax and a remote to flip channels and tweak settings between HD, SD, and Analog. Samsung 50A550 Plasma: I like the overall picture quality of the plasma, I think the motion is much smoother and it is easier on the eyes. I don?t like the fact that the LCD is much brighter looking and the colors pop out at you. The LCD is sharp and looks crisp and has cleaner looking images. Samsung 40A650 LCD: Again, I like the fact that the LCD is much brighter, cleaner, and sharper looking while watching HD signals. However, when I put both TV?s on SD/Analog channels the Samsung 50A550 smoked the LCD?s in the store. While watching standard TV there is a lot of fuzz or pixilation I guess, (it looks very grainy and kind of pitiful) on the LCD but the plasma looked awesome with any signal coming to it. My logic says that having better cables and a stronger signal, the plasma would still look better than the LCD. Does this sound crazy? I need help from the people who own either one of these sets. After tonight though, I am leaning towards the plasma (I get a bigger set in the same price range also).</Content>
