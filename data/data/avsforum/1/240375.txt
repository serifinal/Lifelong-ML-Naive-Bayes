		<Content>I am looking to buy a 42' plasma and I have narrowed it down to the Samsung PN42A450 and the LG 42PG20. I plan on watching SD and HD content on the tv through satellite or over my wired network on the xbox 360. I also plan on using the tv for gaming. So I am curious which TV should I get, Samsung PN42A450 or LG 42PG20? Thanks for your help.</Content>
