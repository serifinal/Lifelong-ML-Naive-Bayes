		<Content>Instead of searching through 1000s of threads I decided to post my own. I just installed my Panny AE3000 and I was going to install a 120 Sarria screen thats motorized... but after testing the panny against the wall, I decided I need something between 125 to 130inch. So what manufacturers do you guys recommend and how much should a screen of that size cost me? Im still kind of new to this whole projector scene. But I want the best bang for my buck, thanks!!!!</Content>
