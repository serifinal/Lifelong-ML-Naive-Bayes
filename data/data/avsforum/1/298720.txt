		<Content>I'm ready to buy one of these two tv's but i can't decide on which one. I've read good and bad on both but i was curious of owners which one to get. I'm all about picture quality so any recommendations? I'll also post a poll on which one everyone likes better to help me decide. Thanks</Content>
