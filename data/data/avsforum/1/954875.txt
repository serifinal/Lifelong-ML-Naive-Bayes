		<Content>Hi guys, I'm interested in the totem tribe II and IIIs mainly for movies and sports. I did get to audition them and was quite pleased however the place I heard them at couldn't set up the tribes with a blue ray player or anything so I wasn't able to hear them with movie dialog. Anyone heard them on movies? and if there's a dramatic difference between the IIs and IIIs? thanks.</Content>
