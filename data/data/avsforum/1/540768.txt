		<Content>I have been looking into getting a new home theater system for a little while. I don't know much about audio equipment, my knowledge is mainly in the video part of HT. I'm looking at the Denon 1909 receiver and I don't know what speakers I should get. I don't know what kind of speakers I should get. What is a good brand of speakers? The Denon 1909 receiver is a 7.1 system. I am not looking to spend over 600$ on the speakers. I also want a good quality, good sounding set of speakers. Any help will be greatly appreciated.</Content>
