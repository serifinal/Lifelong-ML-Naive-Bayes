		<Content>Hello, I've been looking for a TV for Nearly 2 months now and I'm pretty sure I do want a Plasma and I was interested in the Panasonic TH42PZ80U or the TH42PZ85U. I would like to know the differences between the two and which would be a better purchase for the money. I know Plasma's do use more Power than LCD's and I heard the 80u was more energy efficient, would this make a really big difference??</Content>
