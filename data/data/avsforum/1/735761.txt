		<Content>Hi from Italy i am really unsure between series 9 and kuro 5020 - i can get the led samsung 46" 786 for 1800 circa euro or a series 9 for 2100 (they are equal right???) if yes i will go for the 786 - then the kuro 5090 that i think it s equal to your 5020 but is very expensive here in europe about 3000 euro !!!!!!! so i think that i would buy it from USA, because costs only 1800 euro, but i have to think about delivery and taxes....(can u suggest me an internatonal delivery cheap store..????) - If not what do you suggest ????? previous kuro 5010??? Panasonic PZ 8/800??? Samsung plasma Series 5 6 or 7??? or What.........wait for next models/technology Oled exct........... Hope you answer a lot thanks bye</Content>
