		<Content>I currently have the Samsung 630 and I am not to have about the black levels in this tv. The blacks are more like dark grey. I went back to the department store and I have a salemans who said they can sell me the 750 for the same price as the 650. Which is 300.00 more than the 630 I just got. I love the blacks in the 650/750 and the 630 screen reflects just as much as the 650/750. I heard that the 750 are having alot of halo effect problems and the 650 just has a ugly bezel. Can some of guys give me some advice. I have about 2 hours to think on it.</Content>
