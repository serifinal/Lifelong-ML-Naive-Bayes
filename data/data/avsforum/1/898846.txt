		<Content>Is the PQ of the toshiba pretty much on par with samsung? Black levels, colors, sharpness, motion blur. The a550 is a lot cheaper but I'm willing to pay the premium if the toshiba has the same picture quality with 5:5 120hz. Anyone actually have experience with both? or should I wait for the sony z series? thanks</Content>
