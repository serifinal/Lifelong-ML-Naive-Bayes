		<Content>So I am currently using a Toshiba SD-6109C DVD Receiver. It has a built-in DVD player, but I haven't used that part in years (I use stand alone players). Normally, I'm a "ain't broke, don't fix it" guy, but I'm finding the 6109C is a pain with my HD devices. I want to keep the price between $500 and $800. I have a 55" 1080i RPTV which has 1 DVI input and 3 Component but no HDMI. My TV does not support 720p, only 480i/p and 1080i. However, I'm aiming to get a 55"+ 1080p LCDTV via HDMI/VGA/Component by the end of 2009. My speakers are a set of Bose double-cubes for l/c/r and infinity's for rears. They all handle 100 watts and a powered sub with a coax connection. I'm not using the Acoustamass module. I connect my TW 8300HD-DVR to my TV via an HDMI-DVI cable, audio to my 6109C via optical. Philips DVP-5992 to TV via component and audio to 6109C via coax. Wii to TV via component, audio to 6109C via RCA. xBox 360 Elite to TV via component, audio to 6109C via RCA. I would like to run the DVR, DVP and 360 Elite to the receiver via HDMI and be able to use an HDMI-DVI cable to the TV. The I'd also like to run the Wii's component to the receiver and have it output through the HDMI to the TV. Radio would also be nice, but it's not required. My goal is to make switching between devices really simple as my wife is getting annoyed that she can't figure out the current configuration. I've looked around and just don't have the brain power after work to figure AV stuff out. So, I'm open to suggestions. I'm not brand loyal or watt hungry. I'm getting 50x5 right now and it's plenty. What do you all think and thanks for the help.</Content>
