		<Content>Ok if you had to choose between Samsung 650 and 750 series,Sony Xbr5,Panny TH-50PZ800U or New Pioneer Kuro 9g 5020... I will be buying my set no later than August... I have roughly about 3600 bucks to spend.... Now Most of my tv watching is composed of Hd Shows and Blue Ray movies.. As for gaming I will probably be doing that in about a year or so...I would not game for more than 2 hours a day or every other day.... I watch alot of tv with some of the lights on.. I do prefer lights off though... I watch tv when im eating and that is usually at about a 45-60 degree angle..... most of my tv watching is done at dead center though.... My personal preference: I hate motion artifacts I cant stand them.. I love razor sharp pictures and warm colors... I love good black levels... Which of these sets do you think will provide the best pq and why... Which would you buy??? I love the pop and sharpness of the sony xbr4 but love the blacks and smoothness and flawless playback of the pioneers...The more i review on Avs The more im confused lol...</Content>
