		<Content>I'm trying to decide between two rather equal models between the two best LCD brands, since I hardly find any difference in quality. What are the pros and cons between both the Sammy LN-T4671F or Sony 46W3000? Those are both equally spec'd and priced by every sense of the word, and I don't know which direction would be better.</Content>
