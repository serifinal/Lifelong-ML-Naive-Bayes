		<Content>Does anyone have any suggestions on a temporary masking system for a manual retractable screen. I was thinking of maybe using velcro to secure a long strip of black velvet across the top and bottom of the screen, then remove them when I need to retract the screen. This sounds and might look kinda ghetto though. Keith</Content>
