		<Content>I know this is the DIY section, but there seems to be discussion from time to time about DJ sound systems and their gear. I am looking for some GREAT sounding powered Dj speakers. Majority of the music will be recorded, not live. They are for outdoor use (tailgating) but only need to cover a small area (15' - 20' in every direction). Budget is less than $1000 for the pair. Thanks</Content>
