		<Content>Hi Everyone, I'm looking for the discrete input hex codes for my Insignia 42" plasma tv. I am using a Harmony 880 remote and Logitech informed me that if I can get the hex codes they will update their database. If anyone one has them or knows where they can be found it would be appreciated. Thanks Craig</Content>
