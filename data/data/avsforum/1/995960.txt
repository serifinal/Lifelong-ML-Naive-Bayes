		<Content>Three years ago, I purchased some Klipsch Promedia 2.0 speakers after seeking advice from audiophiles like yourselves for the best 2.0 system under $150. And I loved them. I mean I really loved them! Unfortunately for my ears and for my budget, I am running into the problem that apparently everyone else but me knew about with these speakers, and the left speaker is now on the fritz. I am looking to replace them with another 2.0 system. It's three years later, but I'm turning to you, the pros, again: (Nowadays) what's the best 2.0 speaker system in the 150-dollar ballpark?</Content>
