		<Content>Based on what I've read about them, I'm thinking about getting a 50" Panasonic Plasma TV. The question is, which one? I've tried reading up on the various differences between them and what I've found is: PZ80: base model PZ85: - has a VGA port - has some auto contrast dealie which is why it's rated as 30k:1 as opposed to 20k:1 for the PZ80 PZ800: - better audio - support for 24p (as opposed to other two models which use 3:2 pulldown) - extra HDMI input (4 instead of 3) - THX certified Based on what I've read, the extra features don't appeal to me. Supposedly, the 24p mode causes flicker, I don't care about extra inputs, and I've got a separate audio system. So is there any reason to buy either of the more expensive models?</Content>
