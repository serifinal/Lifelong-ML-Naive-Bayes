		<Content>Good Morning To All. I am looking to purchase a new popcorn machine for my home theater and am looking for some input on what make/model to choose for my application. Here is what I am looking for. - A 6oz popcorn machine - Warming Tray/Deck - Old-Maid Tray/Deck - Stainless Kettle - Removable Kettle - Lighted Enclosure I'm not sure where to start as for what manufactures are good/reliable, or what models offer the options I want inside a particular make. Additionally, I am looking for opinions on where to make my purchase . (Who has the best deal and best customer service.) Also any personal experience based opinions are welcome, as I don't know exactly what I want and could be swayed away from any of the options I have listed above. Thanks for your time, Mark Mokita</Content>
