		<Content>Ok well I have been out recently to replace my Samsung HP-S4253 which is a 42in plasma and i have looked at both the PN50A650 and LN46A750. Besides the obvious differences of 50in vs 48in and plasma vs lcd what else are the differences between these two displays? I am mostly looking to enjoy great football, dvds, and bluray! Any opinions would be great to hear!</Content>
