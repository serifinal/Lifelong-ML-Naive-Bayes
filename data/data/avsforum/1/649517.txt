		<Content>For those that have seen both sets, what does each set have over the other? My main question, is the Panny ~$150 better than the Sammy is? Does one produce better whites and blacks? I am looking at about 50/50 HD and SD viewing. No bashing, I have limited expierence with plasmas, just want some comparison info.</Content>
