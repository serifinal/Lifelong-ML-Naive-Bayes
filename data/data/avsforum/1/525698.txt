		<Content>I am helping out a relative select equipment for a Home Theater Project, and I need some help deciding on a Projector. I've only started learning about projectors and projector technology in the last month, so I dont know a lot about projectors yet. So far I have read reviews for the Mitsubishi HC7000 and the JVC RS2 at ProjectorCentral.com, which said the HC7000 and JVC RS2 were the best videophile projectors in their respective classes (They were reviewed nearly a year apart, and not compared to one another). I have also tried to read the separate threads for each projector, but those have proven to be fruitless as the threads are many pages long, and the information is to dispersed throughout the threads. While both projectors received good ratings, there is no way of knowing which one is better. Further complicating the decision is that JVC has released the RS20. So I was hoping that some one could explain to me if one projector is better than the others, or point me to a place that provides answers to the my question. What is important to me: Image Quality, Image Quality, Image Quality! Darker Black levels Better ANSI Contrast Levels Picture Sharpness Accurate Color Saturation Brightness, as long as the image doesn't appear washed out. All of the above are important up to a point, as long as the image keeps a natural look. Here are the things I am aware already aware of: HC7000 costs about half of the RS20. - But price isn't a big factor compared to performance. HC7000 is 3LCD. RS20 / RS2 are D-ILA/LCoS. Which is better Technology i don't know. Projector Central gives the HC7000 ANSI Contrast of 409:1, JVC RS2 gets 209:1. No Rating for RS20. So my question is which is the better projector for a videophile, the RS20 or HC7000, and are there any improvements in the RS20 from the RS2? I mean is the HC7000 which costs 1/2 as much, in a lower class of PJs from the JVC Models, or is there just a mark up for JVC? And is there a major difference between these models and even more expensive DLP models like the RUNCO RS1100? If there are any other projectors that have excellent image quality in this price range that you think are better feel free to mention them as well. Thanks in Advance for your suggestions. Expected Setup 123" 16:9 Stewart FireHawk G3 Screen OPPO BDP-83 Blu-ray player when it is released, or DVDO Edge hooked up to PS3.</Content>
