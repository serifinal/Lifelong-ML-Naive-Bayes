		<Content>Hey everyone, I am trying to decide on a replacement for my Samsung 24" LCD (PC monitor). I am looking for a 32" to wall mount and I am wondering which is my best option. My primary use will be desktop use (internet browsing & desktop applications), followed by gaming, and occassionally watching bluray movies (via cheap internal Sony SATA player). My viewing distance is about 3-4 feet. I have narrowed my search down to these 3 choices: 1) Samsung LN-32A550 @ $900 2) Samsung LN-32A650 @ $1000 3) Sony KDL-32XBR6 @ $1000 PS: I don't want all the comparison of 120hz vs 60hz, just which would you choose given what I am using it for and price breakdown.</Content>
