		<Content>I'm looking to get your opinions on which tv to get, the Samsung pn50a450 or the Panasonic 46pz85. The Samsung is and the Panasonic is. Right now I don't have a blue ray player to take advantage of the 1080p, but may get one down the road. Screen size they would both be plenty big enough for me. I guess I'm a little stuck on this decsion and could use some swaying to one or the other. Thanks.</Content>
