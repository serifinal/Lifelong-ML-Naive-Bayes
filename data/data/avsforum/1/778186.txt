		<Content>To anyone who has seen both the Samsung PN**A550 and Panasonic **PZ800U, how do they compare? I'm planning to get a 58 inch and am deciding whether to pull the trigger on the Samsung now or wait 6 months or so for the Panasonic. Sounds like only the smaller sizes of the Panny are available now, but any comments would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</Content>
