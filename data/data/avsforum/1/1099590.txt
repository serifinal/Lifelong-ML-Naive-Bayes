		<Content>From all I've read, I know the Vizio 37" VX37L is a good TV. The Cnet & PC mag and your reviews were all good. The Vizio 42" VX42L is $148 more at Sam's than the Vizio 37". I have a few questions? 1) Is there really enough size difference between a 42" & 37" TV to justify the price difference? 2) My TV armoire is 42 1/2 wide (with 2 vent/cord holes in the back). The 37" Vizio measures 36.2"W x 26"H x 10.4"D & the 42" measures 40.5"W x 28.4"H x 9.7"D. I can fit the 42" but would it be better ventalation wise to get the 37"? 3) The 37" Vizio seems to have better reviews overall than the Vizio 42", correct? I'm scared because the Cnet review said the 42" has a "green tinge" and I would be driven nuts by that. So the 32" has better performance, doesn't it? Or does it? 4) I'm debating between buying from Dell ($30 cheaper than Sams) and Sams. I'm thinking maybe it's better to buy from Sam's because it's easier to return to the store, should it be defective. Also, Dell doesn't give any additional warranty (neither does Sam's). Am I right in thinking that the less shipping and jostling a TV gets, the longer it will last. So it's better to buy at the store instead of having one shipped? 5) I'm going to use it as a monitor with my Dell Diminsion 3000 (from 04') with a VGA port for use with TV (not the one for the monitor, and additional one). The Vizio's don't come with this cord. Dell provides one for $25. If I don't buy from dell, what and from where should I get this cord? I'd like an inexpensive, but good one if possible. Also, my living room is VERY bright during the day and the window treatments (even with shades) still make it bright and can't be adjusted to make it darker. I love them and don't want to replace them. Would the Vizio TV's work well in brightly lit rooms? Any other help or advice would be appreciated... Thanks!</Content>
