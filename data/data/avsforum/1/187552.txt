		<Content>Hi everyone, Well Ive been in the market for the past couple of weeks for a new LCD tv for my very first home purchase but I am completely in the dark in regards to what is a good tv/brand to buy these days. I've tried reading through some of the other posts but ya'll seem to be extremely knowledgable where-as Im still quite the noob when it comes to the LCD technology I currently have a 46" KDL-46S2000 Sony TV which has performed extremely admirably for the past 2.5 years but with the bigger room I'd like a bigger TV (and something with 1080p capability!) In any case, I am in the market for a 52"+ LCD for my family room. I've been somewhat interested in the new 55" from Samsung (LN55A950) but I've heard so many mixed reviews from folks on here saying that its great and then some saying its not worth the money....and at $4000 its hard for me to make an informed decision without being able to physically see it (best buy, ciruit city, etc, dont have floor models). Plus do I REALLLY need the additional 3"?? Well the gadget nerd in me says yes but the practical side of me says no. So what will I use the TV for: 1 - BluRay Movies via PS3 (all types...action / horror / comedy) 2 - HD programming via cable (e.g. ABC / NBC / TNT / etc). I only watch sports randomly and not very often (more of a "go to the bar and watch" thing IMO) 3 - normal tv 3 - ps3 games I have about $4000 to spend which is why the new Sammy looked nice but if its performance isn't that great then I will not consider it. Im also looking to get it within the next couple weeks so hopefully its not something I truly have to wait a long time for. Any suggestions you all have would be greatly appreciated!! I know everyone has a different opinion and have their brand loyalty or what not but all comments are welcome. Thanks very much! UPDATE: So I just noticed the Sony 52" XBR6 is at Crutchfield.com but only for pre-order. Any idea when these become available? I have been impressed with my current Sony LCD so wondering about these new ones.</Content>
