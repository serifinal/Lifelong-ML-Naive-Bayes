		<Content>I am seriously considering jumping on board and joining the ranks of projector owner, but want to do it wisely. My question is when can I expect to find the best deals? I am willing to wait a number of months to find bargains. - Is Black Friday the best? - Later on in the Christmas Season/Year end? - Super Bowl time? - New model releases? - Other? - Will the economic troubles cause there to be some extra special deals do you think? Of course I realize at some point you just have to go for it because otherwise you will be waiting for ever, but still I would appreciate thoughts and advice on when would be the best time to part with my hard earned money. Thanks.</Content>
