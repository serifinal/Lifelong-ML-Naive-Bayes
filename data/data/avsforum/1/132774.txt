		<Content>This will be my second projector,I'm going to be upgrading from an Optoma HD 70.I will mostly use it for PC gaming majority of the time,very few movies,mostly concert Blu-Rays/DVDs. The placement restrictions of the infocus wont be much of an issue.I can light control my room too.I can purchase either one within a few hundred dollars of each other with the infocus being slightly more. Thanks for any input</Content>
