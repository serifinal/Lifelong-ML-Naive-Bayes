		<Content>Hello all... So I'm finally going to bump up my (still relatively new) 26" Sony 720p (not XBR) set to a 1080p set. I have very limited space, so the max I can go to is 32". The two sets that look the best to me are the Panasonic 32LZ800 and the Sharp 32GP3U. From what I have read here, people rave about the Panasonic, but the Sharp is also nice (I like the swivel stand, tho' getting a TV just for that would be silly). Has anyone here seriously investigated both, and found one head and shoulders above the other? - Tim</Content>
