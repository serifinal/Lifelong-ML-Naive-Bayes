		<Content>Hello all, I was thinking about buying a Samsung Vibrant (or other android t mobile phone) until I got some bad news. I called a tmobile store(official, not reseller) in my neighborhood and they said they wouldn't sell the phone without a data plan. I thought that was weird so I called tmobile customer service and they told me that the phone would not work at all unless I had a 30$ data plan. I don't really want a data plan because I planned on using wifi(available in most places I will be using the phone) for internet access instead. So my question is, can I buy an unlocked Galaxy S and use it on T-Mobile(US) without a data plan? Will any problems arise from me going this route(updates, servicing, etc). Thanks</Content>
