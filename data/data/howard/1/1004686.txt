		<Content>I just want to know the difference between the "unlimited Data useage" and "email and web for smartphones" options as you check out on the Verizon site. I plan on getting a Droid phone. Haven't decided which yet, but what is there difference between the two options as I check out? other than the $45 for one and the $30 for the other?</Content>
