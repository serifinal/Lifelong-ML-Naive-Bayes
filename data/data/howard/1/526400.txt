		<Content>I have an iPhone that is off contract that I bought when I needed a new iPod, in hopes that Telus' HSPA network would be ready. But it looks like I have to wait until January. Is it possible to use the iPhone with a data only plan, with no voice plan? I need to keep my number with Telus, and its in a contact, so I don't want to switch. Sorry if this has been posted before.</Content>
