		<Content>Pretty simple. I have a mint 3GS as described in the post title that's been sitting in a box for three months. It's been unlocked (and updated to the latest firmware). I'm looking to either trade for a Telus Hero, or buy a Hero outright from some enterprising Canadian. I can provide pics and anything else one might require if and when interest is expressed.</Content>
