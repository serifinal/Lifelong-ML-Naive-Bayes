		<Content>Hey Guys, I'm about to order a Nokia N900 and I really want to have data on it, I called T-Mobile and they have a data only plan/SIM that I can get for $39.99 a month. I think it is a bit steep but w/e. Is there a way I can add some minutes to the data plan SIM? Either 100 minutes a month or something or just a pre-paid amount of minutes? The phone will be for data and video stuff while traveling so the minutes would be primarily for situations when I don't have my BB on me... Thanks Guys, Mike</Content>
