		<Content>Hello, I'm looking to purchase an Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant, Mint, LNIB or BNIB. Looking to purchase this with all accessories, unlocked preferred, but locked is okay. Also looking to sell my Nexus One $530 or trade for Galaxy S Vibrant plus a bit of cash on your end. Nexus One is in 10/10 condition, and had a BSE skin since day one, and still have more. Comes with warranty, and all accessories. Looking to purchase/sell ASAP, contact at 647-938-0772 for quick reply. Thanks, SplitSnake</Content>
