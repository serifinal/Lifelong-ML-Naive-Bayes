		<Content>Hi, I lost my Samsung AT&T phone and am considering Nokia 5530 and 5800. My questions are about 3G and Ovi Store. My phone use is voice, texting, and message with photo. I don't have a data plan. Am I going to be okay with non-3G phone (5530)? To get the mail-in rebate, I have to activate Ovi Store, pressing Ovi Store button on the phone. Is this some kind contract to buy?</Content>
