		<Content>I have a couple of lines on family accounts and I was wondering if I could chose to port one in to my Verizon prepaid? I keep the Verizon prepaid in the car for emergencies because of the coverage, will I be able to call in to Verizons prepaid customer service and port in a number or would I have to buy a new phone? Thanks in advance.</Content>
