		<Content>I have a Nexus One that works with AT&T 3G but can also be used for T-Mobile. It comes with box and all original accessories along with a 4GB memory card. I am looking to trade for a nicer phone like the Bold 9700 for AT&T, iPhone 3GS, AT&T Palm Pre Plus, or something nice. PM me if you have any questions. Pics available upon request.</Content>
