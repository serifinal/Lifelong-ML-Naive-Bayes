		<Content>I need to know for a international trip I'll be taking. I plan to get a USB modem with unlimited data in the country I'm going to (UK) so I can plug it into my CTR-500 and then use that Wi-Fi signal to get UMA on my T-Mo BB to call back home (US) for free. Does anyone know if it's possible to use UMA off of a CTR-500 router? I would try it myself but I do not have a USB modem of my own, nor any other phone to try.</Content>
