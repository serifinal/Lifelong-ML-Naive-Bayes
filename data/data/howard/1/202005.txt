		<Content>Hello all, I currently have a jailbroken iPhone 3G. I am planning on upgrading to the next gen iPhone when it's released in a couple of months. I am thinking that I want to keep my 3G since it's jailbroken and I can use MyWi to tether my iPad. The way I understand it is, the extra line is $10.00 plus the $30.00 for the data plan. My question is, by adding an extra line to my family plan using a device I already have, will I be required to sign a contract for that extra line or will I be able to have it on a month to month basis? Thanks David</Content>
