		<Content>Hi all, I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question but here goes... I am on virgin mobile and recently broke my phone. I was wondering if it is possible to buy a samsung vibrant from Bell and then use it on virgin mobile. Would I need to unlock the phone and/or buy a sim card? Thanks</Content>
