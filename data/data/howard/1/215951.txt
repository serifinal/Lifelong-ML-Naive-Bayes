		<Content>If I have 2 lines and only 1 of them is available for the upgrade, so I ordered on that line, but I want to really use the iPhone 4 on the non-upgradeable line (my line). How will that work with swapping the MICRO SIM ? Do I have to get a separate micro sim from the store for my line? Thanks</Content>
