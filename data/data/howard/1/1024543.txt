		<Content>Unlike my other Nexus One, this one is used. But that means it is used only by me which means it is in mint/immaculate condition. You could not tell it was used if you looked at it because of the care I have given to it. Looking to trade for iPhone 3GS, HTC Hero, or any other up to date phone, nothing over a year old. PM me with questions to work out shipping and other stuff like that.</Content>
