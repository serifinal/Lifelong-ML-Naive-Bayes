		<Content>We are looking for official Links/Procedures to available discounts Sprint offers. Preferably these will be the most recent ones of course. This has been a common question and it would be of benefit to many if we had a central common thread to which we could edit as new info comes in. The sticky thread will be started/edited once we can establish a common list !!</Content>
