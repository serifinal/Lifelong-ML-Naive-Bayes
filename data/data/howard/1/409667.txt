		<Content>Hi Everyone I am now bored with my iPhone and want to switch to a Blackberry Bold 9700. So my first question is that should I wait a little longer for a new Blackberry? I heard that there was going to be a new Blackberry coming to Rogers later this year. I also heard that it was going to be a touch screen Blackberry. Is this information correct? My current plan with Rogers is: 250/ Unlimited Eve/ Wkds Plan (starting at 8:00PM) Unlimited Incoming Calls - credited Rogers to Rogers Calling - credited Voicemail - credited Call Display - credited Ends October 08, 2011 I also have the $30 for 6GB data plan, which ends on June 23, 2010. Plus, I add the $3 for 30 text messages to my plan. I end up paying about $63 each month. I wanted to go over to Bell with this plan: Up to 500 minutes 2GB data Unlimited sent and received text, picture, and video messages Call display Message Center Voicemail to Text Video Calling GPS Nav Bonus: Unlimited NHL Pick of one of these: Nationwide Fab Five, Unlimited sent and received text (but this is already included in the plan), Double you anytime minutes, Extend Hours (5PM-7AM) Call waiting Conference Calling Call Forwarding No system access fees This plan is $100 per month, but since I am a Wal-Mart employee, I get 50% off any plan. So this plan would cost me $50 per month. I would end up paying $57.35 each month. I save about $5 each month and no worrying about going over my text messages. If I leave and go to Bell, my sister is going to be taking over this plan, without data. So do people suggest I wait for the new Blackberry on Rogers or move onto Bell? Thanks</Content>
