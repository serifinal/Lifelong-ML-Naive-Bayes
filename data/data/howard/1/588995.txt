		<Content>This is probably a stupid question to ask, but is it possible to get the Samsung Galaxy on just a voice plan, and no data? I use Wifi a lot so that would be plenty for me. I tried it out in store and I really like it, but this is the only thing setting me back. My contract needs to be renewed soon. If I can't, What's a good Phone on bell that doesn't require data?</Content>
