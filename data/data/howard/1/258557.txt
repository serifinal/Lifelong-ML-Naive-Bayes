		<Content>I am in no hurry to get a new phone, but I was wondering if there was any good Super AMOLED phones (Samsung exclusive right?) that are being rumored about for the future and would provide a good middleground for what I want. I really like the Wave and its looks, but the screen size is on the small size and it isn't running Android. The Galaxy S looks too big and I definitely don't like the design or aesthetics. What else is looking on the horizon?</Content>
