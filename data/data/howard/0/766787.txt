		<Content>Sorry for the hysteria here but this is a real pita! I am entering the correct code too. I had my 3g bug out and reboot when I connected it to my mac, then all of the apps were rearranged and some settings were off and 5icon dock wasn't working, now I can't get past the lock screen. I enter my passcode and it looks like it works then goes right back to the lock screen. I've tried powering it off a few times, also forcing it to restart (holding home & power) and respringing (sbsettings is set to function at lockscreen) and nothing seems to work. I can ssh into the phone but I have a Mac so I don't think I can change permissions, anyone have any ideas before I restore and reset it all over again. The last thing I did was add/enable the emoji keyboard in ikey.</Content>
