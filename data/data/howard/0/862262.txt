		<Content>Ok, so I exchanged the blackberry for the rumor touch thinking at least I'd have a twitter app. So I downloaded the twitter app and opera mini 5. Opera mini works fine. The twitter app just loads and says " A network error has occured. Please try again later could not connect. Anyone else have the twitter app working on the rumor touch?</Content>
