		<Content>Hey guys, Looks like it's been leaked - the Samsung Wave (s8500) is coming to Bell on July 8th!! (Google Samsung Wave Bell for a whole bunch of info!) The price looks like it's going to be $300, regardless of contract length. Right now it's retailing at independent stores for about $400... do you guys think the retail price is going to drop after the Bell release?</Content>
