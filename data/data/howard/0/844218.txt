		<Content>I'm in need of a site which lays out the steps or someone who's willing to write down the steps as my parents need to use this feature right now. I would just tell them how to do it, but I don't have an S60 phone in front of me nor is google giving me anything that doesn't have to do with isync (they're using a PC) or lays it out in simple steps. I want to say they just have to download PC suite and it should be in there...what am I missing? Can anyone help?</Content>
