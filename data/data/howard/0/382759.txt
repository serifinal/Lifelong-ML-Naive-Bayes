		<Content>Edit #6: I'm no longer subscribed to this thread as it has fulfilled its purpose. This top post will not be kept up to date anymore. Edit #5: Do it yourself! Bell's gonna love this. There is an overall guide posted at XDA: http://forum.xda-developers.com/show...55#post7776555 It requires you to root your phone (at your own risk!), copy a file to your computer and then either launch a Windows .exe or examine it with a Hex Editor. This will produce an unlock code which you then bring back to the phone. Several posters have confirmed this works for the Bell Vibrant. Edit #4: Success! http://forum.xda-developers.com/show...&postcount=588 The user rhcp0112345 on xda-developers (also the guy behind mrcellphoneunlocker.com) has developed an experimental method. It requires you to root your phone (at your own risk!), copy a file and send it to him. For a $35 fee he will use the information in the file to generate you an unlock code which will permanently SIM-unlock your phone (even if you later lose root access). Several posters have confirmed that this method works. He is also planning to release an on-device app to hasten the process but it isn't ready yet. More to come... Edit #3: DO NOT give money to UnlockGenie for an unlock code to the i9000m. They have promised (and accepted money for) unlock codes, but nobody has actually received a code for the Bell Vibrant. It is reported that some customers are getting refunds. Edit #1: I must emphasize that I don't actually own a Galaxy S and probably won't be buying one for reasons of the almighty dollar, but I started this thread to help everyone keep all the SIM-unlocking facts together. If you send me a private message about this phone I probably won't have any answers for you. Happy unlocking! Edit #2: If you purchased an unlocked version from a source other than Bell Canada, please look at the box or the seller's web site for the 3G/UMTS/HSPA bands. If it says 850/1900/2100 then your phone will work fully on Bell/Telus/Rogers/Fido 3G and it's applicable to this thread. If it says 900/1900/2100 then your phone is the international edition which doesn't have both 3G frequencies you need for full coverage in Canada - and it's not applicable to this thread. There seems to be some concern over in an xda-developers thread that the Bell Galaxy S Vibrant (which is actually a NAM 3G version of the international edition with front-facing camera) will be very difficult to find SIM unlock codes for. So let's start this thread as a place to report: 1) Whether you were able to successfully obtain an unlock code - or not - and from which dealer. 2) Which non-Bell SIM you tried in the phone after unlocking, and how well the phone worked on that network. I hope it's not out of line for people to name the vendors here, but it would be useful knowledge for lots of forum users. If it reaches the point that Bell Vibrant codes are easy to obtain, then clearly this thread won't be needed anymore. Update August 10th: No successful unlocks reported, but you can use a Virgin Mobile Canada SIM successfully. Originally Posted by davidhoeg You can use it with a virgin sim card.

Also Croak over at XDA reports: http://forum.xda-developers.com/show...2&postcount=21 I'm a Bell customer now, I own the 9000M, and was told when I called 611 that it was 30 days from my date of purchase, IF, and only if I had service with Bell for that entire 30 days, prepaid or postpaid. My "unlock SIM" from UnlockItNow.com came in today. It works, Telus and AT&T (prepaid) and Vodaphone Australia (prepaid) SIM work in in my 9000M, and both my Telus and Bell SIMS work in my Captivate. Incoming, outgoing, call forwarding, 3G/HSPA data all work on the Bell and Telus networks, obviously can't test the Vodaphone, and the AT&T only lets me use voice since it's a prepaid. I got this SIM card after sending them my IMEI unlock request for my Captivate a few weeks ago (on July 22nd) and paying $14.00. They didn't have codes, sent me this instead.</Content>
