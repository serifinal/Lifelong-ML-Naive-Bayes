		<Content>Ive actually tried this and it seems to work. I recently bought a Blackberry Pearl Flip (Rogers) from Kajiji and stuck my pay as you go SIM card into it. On the SIM card, I have unlimited on device browsing and the 1 cent talk and text plan I was surprised to see that upon opening the icon labeled 'Rogers Mall', it allowed me to completely surf the internet on the Flip without occurring additional charges to my pre-paid account and even downloads seem to work. Has anyone else managed to do this? Maybe its a glitch in the system because I don't believe this is suppose to happen.</Content>
