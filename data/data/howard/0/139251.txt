		<Content>I just noticed that my Earthlink webmail account has a new mobile link for use on legacy phones: m.webmail.earthlink.net. But when I tried it, I got an error box saying "untrusted server certificate". I presume this is the ancient E815 browser having some kind of an issue. Is there any way around this?</Content>
