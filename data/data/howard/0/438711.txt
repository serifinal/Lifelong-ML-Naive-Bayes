		<Content>I'd like to announce that Cellumap is now available for GPS-enabled BlackBerrys OS 4.5 and higher. Works for all carriers and all technologies (iDen/CDMA/GSM/UMTS) ...what is Cellumap? It's a real-time cellular mapping application, that has been available on Symbian only for the past year, but is now available for BlackBerry. The phone apps have different looks, but generally do the same thing (well, Symbian can't show freq info, so BB has a leg up there). But both apps show signal strength and cell info. How does it work? 1- Download the app OTA by pointing your BlackBerry browser to: cellumap.com/ota ...or go here to download ALX and COD files for desktop install. 2- Run the app, and once you have a GPS lock, press the "Send Data" button to plot your point on the Cellumap main page (Cellumap running on a Bold2 9700) 3- To view your point (and everyone elses) go to Cellumap Cellular Coverage Maps and zoom in an area (type a city or zip code in the maps search box), select the network/technology/time-frame, and then hit the "Signal Strength" button to see all points. If no points are available in your area, that means nobody plotted any yet (..so get out there!). (example of coverage point viewing) Theres a small tutorial here to help you get started with the map-viewing if it's a little complicated: Cellumap Map Tutorial So have fun with the app! Get out and plot some points! Any questions can be posted here, or contact me via the Cellumap website. PS- Right now it's only 1 point per button press. An "auto-logging" type feature that will automatically send points based on distance will come in a future release.</Content>
