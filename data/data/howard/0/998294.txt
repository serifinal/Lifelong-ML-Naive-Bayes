		<Content>for those of you that have received it, what do you think of it? i dont have it yet. i was told by a Verizon rep when i got my phone replaced that it is in circulation now being sent to 10,000 phones at a time. and i should expect it sometime soon. seems to be all good and information on their site sounds good, too bad it doesnt let u update manually. just trying to find out the goods n bads of Froyo, if there are any of course. thanks!</Content>
