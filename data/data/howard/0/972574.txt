		<Content>I have been through every setting I can find. For some reason, I am only getting the quick banner notification (about 3 seconds) on the screen when I get a new Tweet via Witter. Can any Witter users verify that they are getting an audible tone when they receive a new Tweet. I am getting tone, popup, and notification light when I get a new email.</Content>
