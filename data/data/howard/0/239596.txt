		<Content>I have this rocket stick for sale. Model Number: ZTE MF668. If you have a data plan, just put in your sim card and you are ready to go. I unlocked this stick so it should work with any sim card. HSPA+ is more like a 4G network with speeds upto 21MBPS as advertised. This stick comes with box, manual and USB cable. Contact me if anyone is interested.</Content>
