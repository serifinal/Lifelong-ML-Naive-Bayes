		<Content>Just got a HTC desire yesterday and have the a few questions. 1. What do I have to do or install to get flash working. The went to a few web sites and didn't see a difference compared to going to those same sites with the nexus. Will I only need to use to stock browser 2. Will nexus battery work in the desire. They are the same size put have a different number after the dash on the part number. I have an extra battery for the nexus that I plan in keeping after selling it. 3. How to get speech to text working with the HTCIME keyboard. Got it working with the X 10, but nothing happens when pushing the button.</Content>
