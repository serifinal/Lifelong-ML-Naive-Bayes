		<Content>As listed above, I have for sale two Motorola Nextel i315s each has a SIM Card. These work great for Boost Mobile or under contract for Nextel. These do have Direct Talk and that is how I have been using these for the past couple of years for direct simplex. I feel better giving one of these to my sons since it doesn't get interference like FRS/GMRS/MURS and it will still work for wireless 911 in an emergency.
