		<Content>I found an interesting thread in XDA developer site. Someone there with an unlocked Vibrant got 3G on AT&T. I think AT&T is using the same 3G bands as Big3s. I have no intention to leave WIND but it's nice to have a choice. It seems this phone is more capable than the official spec. tells us.</Content>
