		<Content>Hi, I was recently in Europe and picked up a Samsung Galaxy S while I was there. It is the 8GB model and it brand new, sealed in package. If you have any questions, please ask. I'm asking $725 shipped in Canada (add $10 for Xpresspost). Cheers Note: I have this IN HAND ready to ship, not pre-order!</Content>
