		<Content>I'm using nokia n86. I just downloaded wikitude from ovi store. After downloading, it asks me where to install the program so i chose to the memory card. The install was successful but now i want to delete the install file in c-drive. It went down from 23mb to 15mb i think. Where is the default location for saving so i can delete it?</Content>
