		<Content>Ok... Here is my issue. been going on for about 2 weeks. I get no 3g in the zip code 19038. Only edge. I am now not getting 3g in center city Philadelphia. So now I can't get 3g at home or AT work. This blows. I called att a bunch of times. Finally there is a tower in my area that is "degraded" That is the word they used. Now I guess I will have to spend the rest of the day calling to get a ticket opened for the philly area. Anyone else having 3g issues?</Content>
