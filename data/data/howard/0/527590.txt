		<Content>I am looking to dump Verizon mid-contract to save with Straight Talk's Unltd plan. I am in the 14519 area code and the r451 looks like my best option but when I ask ST if I can sync it I get the feeling they don't know what I am talking about. Since I get the tech run-around with Verizon this isn't any different, but I do need to sync to Outlook with ease. Thanks for the help.</Content>
