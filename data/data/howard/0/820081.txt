		<Content>So i made it to the meet up, missed the first raffle in which they gave away all three S^3 devices, two N8's and a C7. And stayed around hoping I could catch a Galaxy S so or one of 4 Epic 4G's they were giving away so i could sell it and get an N8.. but no luck . There was a Nokia stand with N8's, C7's, C6-01's, X3's and.. the E7. Also it seemed like I was the only other person next to the 3 guys working there that had a Nseries phone because as soon as I checked a text message the guy was like "Man is that an X6, hey guys look - this guy has an X6" to his partners, and i got there towards the end of the night.. One of them three, the guy that said that, had a green N8, and the green is not THAT green as it seems in some pictures. It's very light, almost the same color as the Sony Ericsson T650 in green. Ok well here is some eye candy from my X6.. They all feel awesome, build quality is amazing on all of them, the C6 is the smallest one but very heavy for it's size and it feels like it's the best build. The E7 has to be pushed with both thumbs to slide it, i tried doing it with one hand but i felt like it would slip from over my fingers on the opposite side and fall down. The slide is very very sturdy, absolutely no sign of wobble/wiggle, it's either closed or open there's no in between or quarter of the way, it'd take some effort to stop it in between. Except for the design and camera they are all the same phone. Oh and i hate the E7 camera, it doesn't even have a two-point camera button, no focus, you click it and it takes a picture as if it's a blackberry.. The three guys working there - two from Nokia, one from Ovi, said - update wise - everything is just waiting to be released, all the S^3 phones will get all the updates that were supposed to be for S^4 and things like swype for the N8 is coming very soon. Not sure what else to add.. Oh they had a N8 hooked up to a 32" LCD, one of the guys was playing Avatar the game - it looked like a good PS1 game on a good TV, or a decent PS2 game. Very nice.</Content>
