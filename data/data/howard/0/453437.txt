		<Content>I know in the past that Group Connect was not offered on Boost Mobile phones. However, I was told recently that if you switch from a Sprint/Nextel post paid account to a Boost account you can now bring your existing DC number over as well. If so, would that enable me to use Group Connect as a Boost customer? Any help is greatly appreciated.</Content>
