		<Content>Hi! I am looking to transfer ownership of my AT&T contract. The contract expires in September of 2011 with a full discount on a qualifying phone in February. My account is in good standing and includes a 450 minute voice plan with 200 bonus minutes for free (650 minutes total) and the iPhone Unlimited Data package. In addition, there are over 2000 rollover minutes! Currently, there is a 15% corporate discount which may transfer. I am also looking to sell a 32GB iPhone 3Gs with my plan. If you are interested, send me a pm or post back. Thanks!</Content>
