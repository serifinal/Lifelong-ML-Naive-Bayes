My partner works for VZW corp. We have to do all upgrades/account changes online, can't do anything in store. I'm eligible on the employee account on my line for upgrade July 4 for upgrade at 2 year pricing. does anyone know if I can call in to employee phone team and request they let me preorder for a phone ahead of time if the phones release date is on or after my upgrade date on the 4th? for example. preorder starts fathers day which is June 20th. I can't officially upgrade until July 4. can employee phone team (*611) allow me to preorder if the Droid X 's release date is on or after the 4th, or do I have to wait til the 4th to preorder/order? my partner says he isn't sure the policy and said I should call in and ask. figured I'd ask here first... anyone know? Thanks for any help!</Content>
