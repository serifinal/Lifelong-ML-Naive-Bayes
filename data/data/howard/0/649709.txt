		<Content>I have been using the Bell Turbo stick around Toronto in the last month. Download speeds from Speedtest.net show I am getting less than 2mbps quite often and around 200kbps on uploads. Kind of dissapointing considering they advertise they have the biggest 3G network. My colleague has a Rogers stick and see's speeds around 4-5mbps. Anybody else getting crappy speeds?</Content>
