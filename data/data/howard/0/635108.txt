		<Content>Hi folks, I have a BNIB Unlocked Bell Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant for $520 OBO. The phone was only opened in order to unlock it. All accessories are still sealed (including the battery) and the original screen protector is still on the phone. I will also include a brand new Invisible Shield (Full Body Maximum Coverage) Kit if my asking price is met. Feel free to contact me via PM if you have any questions. Thanks for looking.</Content>
