		<Content>If you have your droid closed, and you press the down firmly where the search button is located does your droid make a clicking noise like its hitting the top of the keyboard? when i push the right side of the phone firmly it makes the noise and feels looser.... is this because i took the plastic off the back of the keyboard? if i want to exchange at best buy should i use their insurance? if i do exchange should i just tell them it reboots in case they dont want to replace because of this noise? or is this noise/touching normal?</Content>
