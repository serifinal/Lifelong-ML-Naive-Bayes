		<Content>I am looking to part with my Unlimited Data Plan for $57 per month with the Netowk Access Fee. It has much value to me but I need to find ways to make cash quick here. I am offering it for $4500 CAD with a Novatel Wireless MC950D HSUPA Modem. PM me for details or email me at unlimited.gpunl@gmail.com</Content>
