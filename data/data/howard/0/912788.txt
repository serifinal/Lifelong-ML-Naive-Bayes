		<Content>Anyone thinking of ordering the EVO 4G without having seen nor tried it out, please take my advice and find one to try first. Not trying to be negative or anything, but I just got back from a Sprint store, where I was about number 10 in line, guaranteed 2 phones, one for me and one for my wife, and I left the store without either because I was just not sold on it. Coming from an HTC Hero, here is my take on the EVO: - It is huge. No it is not just a little bit bigger than the iphone, it is huge. I like to carry my phone in my shirt pocket and it's big enough to present a problem here. - In line, the Sprint reps handed out little cards with info on how to make the battery last a full day (oh my). - At one time I used the Droid and had major problems with the fact that it has a button on top which you must click to get the screen to come back on after being asleep, and then swipe the onscreen unlock once you did that to actually use the phone. I hated this feature (the Hero has a button on the bottom so you can practically do both actions without having to change your hold on the phone...still inconvenient but better than the Droid system). Well the EVO works the same way as the Droid. And since it's bigger than the Droid (considerably) it's more of a pain in the butt to have to do this every single time you want to bring the phone out of sleep. -The EVO uses (what do you call them?) non mechanical buttons on the bottom of the phone (again much like the Droid) instead of actual mechanical buttons like on the Hero. Well these do not always respond to the touch...the mechanical ones do. Another pain in the butt. - Although there is no 4g in my area yet (LA) and I may have to wait for 4g for a real good appraisal to be fair, the brower experience was nothing stellar and really no better than what I get on the Hero using the Dolphin browser. - Call quality while nothing to really complain about was not great and as a matter of fact I felt that the Hero here too sounded better. With all these issues, I felt that paying an additional $30/month for a hotspot and another $10 a month for 4g (which I may not even have for a year or so) just made this phone a whole lot less attractive than it seemed yesterday. Frankly, the Hero is about the best overall phone I have ever owned (and believe me, I have owned QUITE a few) and I did not feel that the EVO was any better and maybe not even as good. Very disappointing to say the least! While I use the Hero, I still think the iphone is about as good as it gets (it's just that AT&T literally sucks and that's why I don't own one). I do NOT think that after what I saw this morning that the EVO can hold a candle to it. So again, please..I know lots of people get caught up in all the hype surrounding new gadgets and feel that need to HAVE to own them. Take a look at this one first, I honestly don't think it comes close to all the hype over it.</Content>
