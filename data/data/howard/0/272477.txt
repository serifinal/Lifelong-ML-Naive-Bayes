		<Content>Item: BNIB Unlocked Bell Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant i9000M Price (and Currency): $600cdn FIRM Condition: Brand New - 10/10 Accessories included: * Bell Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant i9000M * Battery (installed in the phone) * USB cable * AC Adapter * Headset * Original box Additional details: This item is a brand new Bell Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant i9000M world phone. Unlike AT&T's Samsung Galaxy S Captivate and the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S Captivate on Rogers, the Bell Vibrant i9000M has a front-facing camera and FM radio with RDS. This is currently the most high-end Android phone available in Canada. Most retailers have completely run out of stock or are no longer selling it outright (without a mandatory contract, credit check & in-store activation). This item was purchased from Bell World ($565 outright purchase + $35 activation with Bell + $30 Month-to-Month plan). The box was opened in-store to activate this phone with a Bell SIM card. It supports the 3-button recovery and download mode combinations. It is fully unlocked and rooted. It supports 3G on Bell, Telus, Rogers, Fido and AT&T Wireless, and GSM only on T-Mobile. It can be used on any 850/1900/2100 3G/HSPA network, as well as any GSM network in the world. As you can see by the pictures, this phone is in brand new condition. It was only used to be activated, unlocked and rooted. It has been protected with a high quality anti-glare screen protector ever since day one. Location: Thornhill (Bathurst & Clark area) Notes: My asking price is $600cdn FIRM. I won't be making any profit on this phone; I'm simply looking to recoup my costs. Bell is no longer allowing any retailers to sell this phone without a mandatory contract & in-store activation. That means if you were to purchase this phone from a retailer, it would cost you a minimum of $630, ($565 for the phone + $35 for activation + costs of a Month-to-Month plan. The cheapest plan available is $30/month) you would be subjected to a credit check and you would have to sign a contract with Bell for a minimum of 30 days. This phone is being offered on a first-come, first-served basis. If you act quickly, you'll end up getting this phone at a great price. My contact information and PayPal email address (if applicable) will be provided to the winning buyer. I prefer local pickups in the Thornhill area, and can arrange to meet the buyer at the Promenade Shopping Centre at a mutually agreed upon date & time. I'm also willing to ship this item (via UPS Express Saver) to anywhere in Canada and the continental United States. Shipping quotes will vary based on your location. If you'd like a shipping quote, please send me your postal/zip code. In order to qualify for shipping, you must have good feedback on HoFo, a verified PayPal account and a PayPal confirmed address. The item will be shipped out to your PayPal confirmed address after full payment is received and the PayPal funds have cleared to my account. I usually ship my items the same business day, provided that I receive a cleared PayPal payment before 2pm (Eastern Daylight Time). In the rare and unlikely event that I am unable to verify a PayPal payment, or if the received funds have not cleared to my account within 24 hours, I reserve the right to cancel the transaction, issue a full refund, and offer this item to another qualified buyer. For local pickups, I will only accept cash (bills in the $50 denomination or less). If I'm shipping this item, I will only accept PayPal. No exceptions. I reserve the right to refuse any offers and/or cancel our sale if you do not agree to the local pickup or shipping terms. PM is key. Please note that I will only deal with established HoFo members with good feedback. Low ballers and HoFo members with no feedback will be ignored. Thank you and good luck!</Content>
