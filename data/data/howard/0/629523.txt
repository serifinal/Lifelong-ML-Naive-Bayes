		<Content>I see endless threads for people asking how to edit themes or create their own so I'm voting to sticky this in the main forum as that's where most people end up coming to ask anyways. In order to do this, you have to know how to SSH into your phone. Learning how to do this allows you to do pretty much whatever you want from changing SMS bubbles to badges, to backgrounds, to making your own icons. For this, you need to download a few things from Cydia on your phone and then a few things to your computer. This guy has excellent tutorials: (these are 2.x tutorials by the way) How to SSH your phone: This guy uses Fugu as an SSH client on his Mac, if you are a windows user, follow similar steps, just use something like WinSCP or any similar windows based SSH client. I don't believe fugu is available for windows, but I could be wrong. http://www.hackthatphone.com/20/open_ssh.html How to create your own themes using Winterboard (he only does a basic tutorial, but once you get the hang of this, you pretty much will know how to edit anything you want.) http://www.hackthatphone.com/20/them...nterboard.html As far as anything else goes, if you get stuck or have questions, how about we ask all questions in this thread? Also, if you want to know a few places to get icon packs or wallpaper packs, or want to share cool ones, put that here too. I personally find a wealth of wallpapers and icon packs on deviantart.com I also found quite a few different sets of SMS bubbles from modmyi.com (you can also achieve the same goal from googling "different color iPhone SMS bubbles" and it brings up several places to download cool SMS bubbles from). I know Cydia has a limited selection right now. You can also MAKE your own icons. Me and my brother use Photoshop for this, but any similar program will do. I believe the typical dimensions for iPhone icons are 59 x 60. Most people use around that range when creating them.</Content>
