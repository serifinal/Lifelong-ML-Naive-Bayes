		<Content>Edit: I must emphasize that I don't actually own a Desire and probably won't be buying one for reasons of the almighty dollar, but I started this thread to help everyone keep all the SIM-unlocking facts together. If you send me a private message about this phone I probably won't have any answers for you. Happy unlocking! Let's start this thread as a place to report: 1) Whether you were able to successfully obtain an unlock code for your Telus Desire - or not - and from which dealer. 2) Which non-Telus SIM you tried in the phone after unlocking, and how well the phone worked on that network. I hope it's not out of line for people to name the vendors here, but it would be useful knowledge for lots of forum users. If it reaches the point that Telus Desire codes are easy to obtain, then clearly this thread won't be needed anymore. Positive report #1: Originally Posted by Jimmy_z I just did it with the Ebay guy for $50. It seriously took 2 minutes to receive my code and it worked great!! Very expensive but I couldn't wait any longer. I had a new Desire sitting in the box on my desk. Too hard to resist!! In this case the eBay seller in question is "mobilexpresscanada". Positive report(s) #2: Originally Posted by 00taffy Sorry, I was too excited. Cellunlock.net like everyone else. I paid $15. I've been waiting since Friday at 3:30. And yes the unlock worked fine - you have to enter the code in twice, but it does work. Hope that helps. Originally Posted by FungFlex He ordered from CellUnlock as did I. I paid $15 on Friday at 6pm using a coupon on this website and it took from then until just this second. I have a feeling they will begin coming much faster now since they updated the database. Originally Posted by chunkdude and im unlocked. as said by someone else you gotta enter the code twice (even though it says successful the first time) but yeah, looks like it worked Originally Posted by James.P Just received the code 5 minutes ago - bought from cellunlock for 15$ with coupon code, like most everyone in this thread. As stated earlier, you have to enter the code twice. Works perfectly, and they kept us up to date throughout the waiting process - very very satisfied with cellunlock for the service and price. And I'm absolutely in love with this phone!</Content>
