		<Content>I have a brand new Blackberry 9360 locked to Rogers. Never used, but opened from the box to ensure contents are intact. Was given the phone for contract renewal but had purchased a different phone elsewhere to use. $300 OBO, lowballers will be ignored. Local sale in the GTA only. No shipping, cash only, no trades.</Content>
