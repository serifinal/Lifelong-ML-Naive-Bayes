		<Content>I have a treo 700wx with winmo5 on it. I just got an htc fuze last night from my new employer, it has winmo6 on it. I have sprite backup on my treo so I have a backup of that phone on my sd card. How can I get at the data in my backup file to get that data over to the fuze? I don't know much about sprite backup, I got it for free a few years back. Can I just load sprite onto the fuze, and do a restore? I think the sprite backup backs up the registry and everything on the 700wx so I can't restore all of that to the fuze. I guess I can just backup the calendar and notes from the treo and restore those without backing up the system data on the treo?</Content>
