		<Content>I have two brand new sealed unlocked 32GB iPhones for sale, priced each at $1080 firm, I will meet halfway for pickup. I am located in Mississauga. As well my 9.9/10 condition White 3GS is for sale, it is only 3 months old, no nicks, bumps or scratches save for some minor scratches on maybe the chrome trim, but again, very minimal, screen protector has been applied since the first day. I will include an Incase rubber case as well at the 3GS dock. Priced at $400. Should you have interest in either please do not hesitate to PM me, I login several times a day Thanks P.S I don't have feedback here, but on ebay my feedback is under my account "theveen"</Content>
