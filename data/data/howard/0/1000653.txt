		<Content>I was waiting for a flight out of Dallas yesterday and stopped by the Samsung kiosk they had in the termnial and they had a Verizon branded Samsung Rogue in the front case. It wasn't turned on, but if they are displaying it at the airport, hopefully they will be releasing it soon. I have the Omnia right now and I can't type well at all with the virtual keyboard. I'm hoping the Rogue is released before my 30 day window is up.</Content>
