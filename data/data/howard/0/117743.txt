		<Content>Are the builds of these 2 phones different? My brother got the Nav edition from Amazon 2 weeks ago and i just received my music ed. from Dell today. My main concern is the camera. I know that the cameras between the E71(Unlocked) and E71x (ATT) are different and you can tell by looking at the lens with a light shined on it. The E71x shines green. Well my Brothers 5800 Nav Ed. Shines green While My 5800 Music Ed. does not. Is this something I should worry about? Are the cams different?</Content>
