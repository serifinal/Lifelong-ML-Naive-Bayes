		<Content>I am selling a mint T-Mobile branded 9700 which is unlocked. Works perfect on Rogers/Fido in Edge or on the new WIND MOBILE network. Working PIN. The phone was purchased by mistake in a deal and is not compatible with Bell's HSPA network. Comes with the home adapter only. No Box. Asking $425.00 OBO PM if interested.</Content>
