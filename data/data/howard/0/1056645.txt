		<Content>Shouldn't there be some sort of requirement to make an "Official" thread? As opposed to "hey, I have no facts to back up anything I speak about (which is fine because a lot of good discussion comes from conjecture) but based on "MY information", which is mostly comprised guesses and somehow tying in completely non-related actions by the carrier and/or manufacturer, I'm gonna start an Official iSlate Pre-Release Thread". STOP IT, PLEASE. IMO on Mods and a couple other people should start "Official" threads. Rant over.</Content>
