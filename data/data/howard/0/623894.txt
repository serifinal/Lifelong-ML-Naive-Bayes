		<Content>Price: $600 Condition: 10/10 - it's brand new & never used... still in plastic. Opened only to activate (to ensure its not DOA) and remove SIM. Comes with: Everything BNIB except the Fido SIM card. Carrier Lock: It is locked to Fido. This phone has the latest boot rom so if you want to jailbreak, it will have to be tethered jailbreak. Location: Local Meetups only - GTA/Southern Ontario only! Sorry, no shipping. Contact: PM is the preferred method of communication. Thank you for your patience.</Content>
