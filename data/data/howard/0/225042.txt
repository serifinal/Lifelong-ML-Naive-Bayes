		<Content>I stopped by a corp telus store to pick up a hero.. the rep working there was very nice, told me 499+tax. I told him it was for a friend. So, when paying he asked if I wanted a sim card. I told him no, the person already has one. He asks "Is it a Telus sim?", Normally i'd just say Ya, but he was a cool guy, so told him the truth, "no, they use rogers".. what a mistake, he started off on a lecture about how the phone wont work on rogers (even if it is unlocked). He spent a minute to explain how Telus uses hspa and 3g+ for the whole new network, and rogers is just gsm. i pulled out my old tytn i have been using recently, and showed him that i've been using it on Rogers hspa since early 2007. This is the best part: He said "yeah, but theirs is an old network, they dont use 3g+, and the band for their network is 1800mhz, and Telus' new network is 2100mhz". You'd think this rep was just misinformed or not totally sure, but he was persistent. I tried telling him that rogers,bell,telus all use 850,1900 in canada, but i couldnt convince him. He said "i'll sell you the phone, dont worry, but its not going to work on rogers, it doesnt have those bands". which band does it have i asked? "this hero only has 2100". i tried explaining to him, and even started asking about where he learned all about this. he told me they spent quite a bit of time doing training to learn about the new network through telus corp programs. The thing is, i thought after maybe some of these uninformed reps are just fed BS by telus, and are told to confuse customers, or try not to let them go to another carrier.. but the manner in which he told me about telus & 2100, and the hero only having 2100 was incredible, i'm sure by the way he looked at me he thought i was crazy and throwing $500 down the drain for a phone that wont work... i just couldnt believe that he was so wrong yet so sure what he was saying was right I really wonder if he could just be confused himself? Or could telus really be teaching that type of stuff to the reps for training info on the new network? I almost feel bad, for him as a telus sales rep for being so poorly uninformed, and also for customers who are making purchases based on what a rep tells them. Maybe I should head back one day to show him the Hero unlocked with a rogers sim in it.. or even my tytn or iphone with a telus sim in it..</Content>
