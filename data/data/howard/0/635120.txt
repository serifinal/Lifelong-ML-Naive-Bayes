		<Content>When I was on Rogers, I had a code on my account that would allow me to switch between my Iphone and a Blackberry - just swap the SIM. Can this be done with Bell's new network? Can I swap the SIM between devices and use the full fictionally of both devices? I.E. BIS on the Blackberry? Cheers</Content>
