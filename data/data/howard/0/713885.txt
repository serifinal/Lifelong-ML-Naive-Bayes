		<Content>Use this thread to post questions, answers, and tips about using the Motorola Droid. Such as "How do I Sync contacts" or "Here's a suggestion..." ----------------- Updated: Going into the programming menu: Dial ##PROGRAM, send, enter 000000, Verify 1-For pictures, they'd go best in the DCIM folder. Inside that you can keep your images organized however you want and they'll retain that organization in your "Gallery" folder. 2-For music, you can put them wherever you want (I made a "music" folder). 3-To set any audio file as a ringtone, open it in the "Music" player and push the menu button. You'll have an option to set it as a ringtone. 4-If you want custom "notifications" (for MMS/SMS/E-Mail) you'll need to create a "notifications" folder and drop the audio files in there. They'll then show up on the list in your settings. -------------------- Home Screen icons Press and hold on screen to add icons, shortcuts, widgets or to remove them b dragging to trash at the bottom.

I could receive but not send. I called VZW tech support and ended up figuring out the problem for him...LOL. For some reason I was able to send him a MMS but none of my contacts. That was the connection. My contacts as exported through Gmail from Windows mobile had a number format like 1(123) 123-1234. They worked fine for calling and text messaging so you'd think they'd work for MMS too Right? Nope. I picked up on this because I put in the verizon tech support guys number like 1231231234. After deleting one of my contacts and entering the number in like this.....it still didn't work....for some reason the phone remembered that it HAD been a contact. After clearing the message thread and restarting the phone IT WORKED. So to get your MMS working, give this a try. 1. Delete any saved message thread, including SMS ones, for the contatct you would like to try to MMS. 2. Then go to edit your contacts phonenumber. Just enter the 10 digit number whout a leading 1 and without any parenthesis....let the phone put the dashes in for you. 3. (if you didn't have to delete a previous thread skip this step) restart your phone. 4. Try MMS. It worked for me and now I'm going back through all my contacts to fix the number format on all of them. ------------------ Here is what worked for me, but we are a small business with an Exchange 2003 server: Domain\Username: abc-corp\jsmith (server domain plus my server username) Password: ******* (server password) Exchange Server: mail.abc-corp.com (after trying a few things that didn't work I gave up and simply directed it to mail at our domain and then the emails started rolling in) It was seriously so easy that it only took me a couple of hours to realize it with the help of this thread. I was unable to get in contact with our outside IT people today and the new phone-itis was driving me crazy. Hopefully, you will find your work around soon.</Content>
