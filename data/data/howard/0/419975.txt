		<Content>Hey all. I have a 9.9/10 condition white iPhone 3gs locked to Fido for trade or sale. All accessories are included and phone is at os 3.1.3. For trades, same phone in either black or white for Rogers, Nokia n97 plus cash or any other smartphone that is interesting. Pricewise, I'm looking for $560obo GTA deals only. No shipping. Thanks.
