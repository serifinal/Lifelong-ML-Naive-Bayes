		<Content>This will probably be the last N97 megathread with Symbian^3 coming soon. (#2342) V30 firmware is coming soon Last poll results: Code: Do you have an N97? Yup 172 68.25% Nope 23 9.13% Never 57 22.62% Here's some tips:How to Reset: press shift + backspace + spacebar and power up your phone to reset it if it gets locked. You will lose all your settings if you do this. Some apps, like the Guitar Hero game, are unrecoverable. Beware! Alternatively, you can dial *#7370# to easily reset your N97 You can save space on C: by doing a reset You can save more space by uninstalling Facebook, AP News, Accuweather and other apps you can find in the Ovi Store. Reinstall them to the E: drive. There's a lot of freeware here http://symbianworld.org/s60-5th-edit...okia-5800-n97/ If google maps doesn't work, check your connections and make sure your home wifi is not the default connection There are some N97 exclusive apps at Nokia Beta Labs such as Ovi Maps 3.03, Ovi Lifecasting and Ovi Social Messaging V20 thread: http://www.howardforums.com/showthre...rmware-Edition Plug: http://www.n97fanatics.com/</Content>
