		<Content>The Wireless Wave store I deal with in Vancouver says that the iPhone 3GS is on an "exclusive" deal right now and cannot tell me a date as to when it will be available to their dealers (ie. Wireless Wave). Can someone confirm this as well as maybe give a date as to when they might be available to all of Bell's dealers. Thanks in advance!</Content>
