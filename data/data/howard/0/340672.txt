		<Content>I have an unlocked T-mobile Samsung Gravity I (T-459). How to find a way of changing its GRPS/WAP/data settings? Is there some hidden menu or something? More generally, how to (completely) un-brand the phone, remove T-zones, T-mobile Mobile Backup, etc? If it matters, my Gravity was unlocked using an unlock code provided by T-mobile Customer Service.</Content>
