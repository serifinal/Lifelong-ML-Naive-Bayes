		<Content>Sorry if this is in the wrong place. I couldn't find a modem section. When I go into the configuration of the modem it says the maximum speed is set to 230400. I am able to change that to a higher number of either 460800 or 921600. My question is: why is it set so much lower than it could go? And what happens if I set it higher? Would the modem over-heat?</Content>
