		<Content>I don't think multitasking is worthless. It serves a purpose, and it may be nice to have, but I don't think it's a killer feature, especially with push notifications that can serve more purpose. Some things do genuinely need multitasking though, but those are limited cases. http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/26/e...mostly-a-myth/ Here's Engadget's point of view. Now, remember they are Apple fanbois, but try to think objectively for a minute. What they have been saying makes good sense. The Android users here and everywhere might understand well. One of the first few apps we get is a Task Killer. Sometimes apps go rogue and go mad. Speedtest.net once tried to keep getting a GPS signal in my building to figure out what server you use. With no exit button it kept going. Had to kill it to prevent my battery from dying. And maybe rarely (since Android tries to manage memory quite well), you might need to free up memory. For those of you complaining about programs randomly being in memory, there's a DIFFERENCE between a program running in the background and one that's loaded into memory. Talk to a Linux dev and you might understand a little better, but this is typically how things work there. Anyway, the Pause/Resume tactic of Windows Mobile 7 isn't that bad to me. It makes sense. You don't have a 24" widescreen monitor with your phone. You don't really need 10 apps running at a time. What for? If you can save state, that's all you really need. The exception as Engadget points out might be streaming radio... or maybe turn by turn GPS. That's pretty much IT. You want to browse and chat? You can't do both in the same window. You need 2 apps. Whats' wrong with saving your browser state, closing it, and then going to MSN and then relaunching the browser? With phones like the N1 and iPhone 3GS that do it all so seamlessly, it's the same as if you had the programs open all the way. They're fast ENOUGH. Of course I find many S60 users here crying about it all the time, but there's really only a few instances where you SHOULD need it like streaming radio. Now I hope Apple really does up their game and fix this. A lot of their games too have a pause and resume feature. You can exit Flight Control and come back and it'll have a Resume button. What's it to you if the program never exited and kept running in the background? It's the same to you. Another thing I've noticed on Android is that people WANT push notifications. We don't really WANT Facebook and Twitter running in the background. We want background notifications like the iPhone. One thing we lack right now is IM that has push, and there's been a lot of talk about it for Meebo. It's a lot better than having an app open just for the sake of being able to IM. Why waste your battery? I find it funny people want multitasking so they can chat and surf at the same time (what many people mentioned on this S60 board before), yet its ironic that push notifications will do the trick and save battery (not to mention your best IM app on S60 is still trash compared to the worst IM app on Android/iPhone). So I feel unless you can have 2 apps side by side, it's quite pointless to scream about multitasking. I think we need it to some degree, and maybe future OSes will provide a better balance. Windows Mobile 7 is certainly going in a better direction than iPhone 3.0 right now.... but we'll see. Bottom line is I think Multitasking is something NICE to have. It can be useful at times, but a lot of cries about it here are more often attempts to bash the hell out of Apple when in reality, you can get by just fine on the iPhone as it is.</Content>
