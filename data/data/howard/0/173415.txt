		<Content>Is it possible to do a number swap with Fido from line A to a prepaid and get a new number on the line A? Or do I have to wait 90 days to for the number to be released back into the pool? I called them and they said that this is not possible. I do it everyday for customers at Telus, it's called triangular swap or premium swap. Fido says this doesn't exist!</Content>
