		<Content>I have two phones available for sale: Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 White Colour. Purchased on May 27 2010. Invoice Available upon purchase. 1 year International SE Warranty. Factory Unlocked (never locked) and No Carrier logos/branding. Link to the Specs for Sony Ericsson X10i Notes: This phone will NOT support Rogers/Fido/Bell/Telus in 3G data mode. It will only work on 2G for these providers. Voice calls, texts, etc will be fine on these providers. However, this phone WILL work on Wind & Mobilicity in Canada and T-Mobile in the States. There are not a lot of White X10i available in Canada, infact there is no android phone currently available from Wind, so this is going to be a good option if you want android on Wind/Mobilicity. Condition: 10/10 LNIB. Available with box and everything that came in it. Accessories are still sealed, the only thing used from the box is the phone and battery. BONUS: Screen Protector already installed. PRICE: CDN $450 or willing to trade for Nexus One that will work on Rogers 3G.
