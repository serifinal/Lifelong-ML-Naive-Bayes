		<Content>Im transferring my Rogers plan to another person, but I also want to transfer/keep my current cell phone number and transfer it to Fido. Is this possible? When I called Rogers, they said its not possible cuz when they port my number, it cancels my service completely. Does anyone know a way to keep my number? I'd hate to have a new number after having my current number for more than 4 years.</Content>
