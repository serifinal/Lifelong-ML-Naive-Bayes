		<Content>Ok, basically the difference in features is 8mp vs 7mp, and 6x vs 4x. I would like to know (from someone who has had experience with both cameras): Comparatively, which has 1 - better overall (indoor/outdoor) picture quality 2 - Better battery performance 3 - Faster (Shutter lag/shot to shot/flash recycle) operation 4 - Less red-eye problems Thank you!</Content>
