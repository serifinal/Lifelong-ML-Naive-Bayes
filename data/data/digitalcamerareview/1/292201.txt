		<Content>Hi, After researching for the last several days, I finally decided to get the Canon Powershot A590 IS. I think it's a good camera from what I've been reading, but I'm starting to wonder if I made a mistake. I'd really prefer an ultra compact, and Newegg has a good price right now on the Canon Powershot SD1100. I'm going on a trip overseas soon and I'd really prefer something I can just fit in my pocket, but I will only be taking snapshots of my trip and friends. I could really use some advice please. What do you think?</Content>
