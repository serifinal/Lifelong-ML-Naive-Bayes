		<Content>Hi, I'm completely new to these forums and I did search a little before posting. Here is my question, here in Canada I can get this : EOS 30D body + case + Canon EF-S 18-55mm Lens + ProTama 58mm UV Filter + 512MB CF Card + card reader USB + extra batteries + 1 year Canon warranty for a grand total of 929$ with free shipping. So basically, is this a good deal or normal price or a rip-off ? I can get my hand on a EOS 40D but I'm not sure if the price difference (+ 600$) is worth it. Thanks for any inputs.</Content>
