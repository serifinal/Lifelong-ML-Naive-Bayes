		<Content>Just purchased a 30D body(my first digital) and now i need a lens for it. Not sure exactly what type of pictures i will be taking so just looking for a good all around prime or decent zoom. My budget would be under $500. Would appreciate any suggestions as there are a lot of options out there. thanks shawn</Content>
