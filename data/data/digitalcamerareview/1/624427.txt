		<Content>Hi. I have an S2 IS Canon Powershot. I love this camera but I am wanting to get some different lenses and filters for it. However, I am not really certain as to what I should get. Do I HAVE to look for one that says specifically for the S2 IS or can I just look for one that is a Canon? I am lost on this. I dont know what to look for or what all I need. Please help? I am wanting to get a wide angle, a telephoto and also some filters. I look forward to some advice.</Content>
