		<Content>I just bought a Canon S5 IS and then bought DigiPower 2700 mAH NiMH rechargables and they lasted like 40 shots while I was playing with my new camera (charger gave me a green light that they were done). VERY DISAPPOINTED! What's the best brand of batteries in your opinions for this camera. What is the best charger to use?</Content>
