		<Content>Hi, I have a Canon SD1000 and I recently lost my battery and charger. I was looking to replace them both with factory canon products, however I was curious if anyone has purchased the "no-name" products and are pleased with them. I don't mind buying the canon brand however I am looking to save as much money as possible. If there are some recommendations of where to buy from it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
