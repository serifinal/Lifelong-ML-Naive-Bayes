		<Content>I'm looking at getting a new camera and came across these two, the Canon Ixus 860 (Powershot SD870) and the Ixus 870 (Powershot SD880) (why can't they keep the same numbering system?). When I googled them the following links to the Canon Australia website came up. http://www.canon.com.au/products/cam...ixus860is.aspx http://www.canon.com.au/products/cam...ixus870is.aspx The main camera menu on the Canon website doesn't show these cameras, however, and I can't find many places that sell them (only online stores). Are these discontinued models in Australia as it appears that they are still being sold overseas. Thanks</Content>
