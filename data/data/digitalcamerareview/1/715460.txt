		<Content>All right so im stuck between buying a Canon Rebel XSI or a Nikon D3000. The Canon comes with a bag, 4 gb memory card, and all the other stuff in the kit along with a 18-55mm lens and a 55-250mm lens all together for $759.00 + tax. The Nikon, on the other hand, is only $500 but it just comes with the kit and an 18-55 mm lens. This is my first DSLR camera, and im torn between these two. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!</Content>
