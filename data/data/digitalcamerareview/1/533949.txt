		<Content>Hello everyone, I am looking for a good quality compact for my friend.... now he does not want the G11 series because it "does not look sexy" So I have been looking around and found the Canon S95 I tried it out but the flash seems very weak... Is it possible to adjust the power of the flash on this camera like the G series? I couldn't really play around in that detail at the time so I couldn't see for myself... Thanks</Content>
