		<Content>Hi guys, I'm wondering not what the size of the actual LCD screen is (I know its 2.5") but if there is any extra border around the actual LCD. Could someone who owns a Canon SD1000 camera, take out a ruler and give me accurate measurements of the screen. The reason I ask this, is because I'm getting this camera for Christmas and would like to buy a screen protector a head of time. And some people were saying that for some camera's that advertise a 2.5" LCD you should really buy a 2.6 or 2.7" screen protector for the camera. Thanks a lot!</Content>
