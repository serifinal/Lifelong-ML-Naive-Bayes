		<Content>Alright i am going to get the 40D i think.. I am new to SLR, but i really like this model. Now on the main site it states its $1,400. I have found package deals off of other various websites having the price around $600-900... Do you think those warehouse like places selling cameras and other accessories is/are shady or fake?</Content>
