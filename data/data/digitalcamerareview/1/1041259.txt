		<Content>The following message came in via e-mail: I am strongly considering buying the digital Rebel XT. I have had two professional photographers tell me not to buy it because Canon will be replacing the Rebel in September. I know its not likely considering both models of the Rebel have been great sellers. Any truth to this rumor?</Content>
