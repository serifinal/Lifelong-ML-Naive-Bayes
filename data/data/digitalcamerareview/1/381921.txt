		<Content>I have a 2 year old, out of warranty, Canon SD1000. It needs to be repaired. The cost is $100. In addition, I have lost the battery charger. That will cost me extra as well to replace. Should I repair the camera or replace it? I would be out $100 PLUS the cost of replacing the battery charger. I looked at the SD1200is. I assume that is the current generation release of the SD1000 line. It is available for about $165 (and that includes a battery charger!). Thanks.</Content>
