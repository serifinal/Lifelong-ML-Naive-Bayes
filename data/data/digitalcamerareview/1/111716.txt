		<Content>hello, i'm a newby here on the camera forums. Can someone give me an idea of what would be a good choice of lens/lenses for outdoor motorsports pics {moto x}. I have a Canon Rebel T1i and want to take pics of some motox friends. Any suggestions will really be helpful starting out. Thank you.</Content>
