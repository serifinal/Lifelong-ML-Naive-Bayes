		<Content>I wonder when there'll be a price drop for the SD870IS Currently, best buy and future shop are still selling it at $399.99 CAD with an OCCASIONAL sale at $379.99 When is it ever going to drop thru the $300 point >_< I was hoping that newer models would be announced; therefore dropping the price...but doesn't seem like there're much new P&S models out from Canon</Content>
