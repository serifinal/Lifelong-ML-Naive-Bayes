		<Content>Hi there! My Powershot A630 was just dropped by my 4 year old and I've spent about 30 hours over the last 3 days researching for a replacement. Between subjective user reviews and technical pro reviews, I have a major headache tonight and was hoping you or someone could help me out a little. I loved my A630, and would find it helpful to use that as a comparison model with the new models. I'll start by sharing what I'm looking for, then the models I've considered. First, it would be awesome to know what cameras would do best under the following conditions. #1...christmas morning, three kids frantically tearing through presents, hardly any natural light and poor lamp lighting. My A630 took decent pictures, but I'd get some blurring. It would be nice to find a model that improved on the lower light and child movements, but I don't need something to shoot moving hockey pucks. #2...Bright outdoors. Loved that my A630 had a viewfinder and tilt screen. No such thing now. I hate when you can't see what you're shooting. What model will allow me to see the LCD screen well? #3...Zoom. I don't need to see miles across Wyoming. But I do want to see my kids across the playground. #4...Is there such a thing as a P&S camera that can capture my kids on a stage from half way back a dark auditorium? A tall order I know, but the A630 wasn't great on that, so will one of the following models improve on that? Good video would be nice, but not worth a huge price increase (maybe $50 more). Extra features would not likely be used. I'm not technical and would likely stay in auto mode most of the time, with the exception of experimenting on night shots of kids watching fireworks or toasting smores, etc. Picture quality is much more important to me than panoramic, fish eye, and all that stuff I'll never use. Battery life...my A630 took AA batteries and I felt I got acceptable use, so anything that would be equivalent would be great. It seems to me that these new models are worse in battery life. Do some have less expensive replacement batteries to use as back ups? So here's the models that caught my eye. The A95 seems awesome, but pricey. I'd rather stay $200-$300 unless nothing else will do. The Elph 300 and 500 look good. I don't see where the 500 would add much more for my purposes, am I wrong? The 4000 or 4500IS look good, can't tell if the newer version offers me more than what I need. The SX210 looks good, but seems that a lot of reviewers don't like some aspects. Which of these, or will another model or brand, suit my purposes without giving me stuff I don't need? I would be so grateful if you could tell me how their picture quality compares with each other, and which would suit my above needs the best. Thanks so much.</Content>
