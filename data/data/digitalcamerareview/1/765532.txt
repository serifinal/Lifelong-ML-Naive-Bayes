		<Content>Okay so I have a sd200 and Im going to upgrade bc my screen is cracked. I dont know which camera I should get. Which is better? I assumed that the higher numbers were better, more recent versions, but the numbering here threw me off. I also noticed that the sd1000 is cheaper so Im leaning towards it. Is there a big difference between the cameras?</Content>
