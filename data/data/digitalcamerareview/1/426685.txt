		<Content>Hello! This is my first post, so I apologize if I'm doing something wrong... I'm need to buy a new camera. My original camera was a power-shot A95. My current one is an sd1000, purchased in approx 12/07. I used to love it, except that I've always found indoor pictures (beyond flash range) VERY grainy, and when using the flash, it can easily take 5-8 seconds for the picture to take- very embarrassing when we're lined up for family portraits and everyone has the frozen smile while waiting for the photo to snap. I recently tried the S95 for a few days, and fell in love with it. Unfortunately, I can't afford the $400 price tag. I looked into 2 other canon's - the 100 HS and the 300 HS, and on paper, they seem very similar. The difference I see is the focal length, but I'm not quite sure what I need. What I'm looking for is: *Small enough to fit in purse/ jeans. *Able to take clear fast pictures (anything better than my current camera will work just fine). *Around $200 (I know the 300 HS is $250, but if it's worth the difference...) *Has a few easy to use picture settings for indoors/ kids/ etc (I know the S95 auto-selects, my current one has a menu) *Shoots decent video *MUST TAKE FAST NON-GRAINY PICTURES INDOORS (OR IN LOW-LIGHT) *Able to switch from Auto and Manual flash as necessary I don't know how aperture with affect me. I don't need a beautiful screen. I don't plan on turning photos into murals, and don't have to zoom in on a plane flying 500 ft away. All I want it something that takes good pictures of family and makes for decent sightseeing memories. Any suggestions (even if it's something other than Canon), would be great. Thanks in advance.
