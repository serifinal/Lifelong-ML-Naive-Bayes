		<Content>I got a canon S500 back around 4/05 and am trying to decide if I should upgrade soon... My main complaints are blurry images without flash in indoor lighting. The image quality when I can get a sharp shot is fine, no complaints with that really, but the frequent blurry images are what gets me. How do the newer cameras compare?</Content>
