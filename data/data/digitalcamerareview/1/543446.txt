		<Content>I search for threads concerning replacement batteries...but saw none. My little Canon SX 200 IS uses the NB-5L battery, and I'm searching for a backup. There are many aftermarket batteries available, but the reviews are spotty. Does anyone have a recommendation for a backup battery? TIA; Dave</Content>
