		<Content>I am looking for a reasonably priced (under $300) zoom lens for a Canon Rebel XT EOS 350D. I need something in the range of 70-300MM that can shoot clear actions shots at distance. An example would be rodeo action in daylight. I want to shoot in continuous shot mode without a tripod. Please advise. Robert Krogle aprilanbbob@verizon.net</Content>
