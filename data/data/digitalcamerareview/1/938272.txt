		<Content>Hi all. I was using a Powershot G9 until recently I lost it/it got stolen. I'm looking to replace it. Im currently in Japan and I found a used G9 at sofmap for ~19800Yen, but the SX130 is on sale everywhere for 16800Yen. I know the G9 is fairly dated at this point, and that maybe the SX130 would be a better replacement for it. Please post your comments/thoughts/concerns. Thanks.</Content>
