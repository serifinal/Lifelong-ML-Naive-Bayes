		<Content>Sandisk Announces 4 GB SDHC Memory Card Sandisk has joined the ranks of companies offering SDHC memory cards. The SDHC media is the same size as a standard SD (Secure Digital) card, but will not work in devices that don't support SDHC media. The SDHC cards adhere to an SD 2.00 standard and will get up to capacities of 32GB. The Sandisk SDHC card is rated for Class 2 speed which guarantees a minimum sustained transfer rate of 2MB/sec. Sandisk's SDHC card will be bundled with MicroMate USB 2.0 reader that can read either SD or SDHC media. The media will be labeled with the SDHC logo and will be available in July for a retail price of $199 for the card and bundled reader.

The camera takes pictures at VGA (640x480) resolution and is powered by a single AAA battery. It's also waterproof to 30 feet in a shock resistant polycarbonate housing. The 32MB of internal memory can store 260 images. Ten second video clips can also be captured at a resolution of 320x240 pixels. The neoprene wrist strap is wide and comfortable and allows the camera to lay flat against your arm or pivot up to vertical for a better picture taking position.
