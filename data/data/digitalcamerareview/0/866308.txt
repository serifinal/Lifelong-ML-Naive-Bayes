		<Content>Hi, just purchased the above, and found that there is a rattle, like something loose inside if I rock the camera gently backwards and forwards. Apart from being exceptionally annoying, the camera seems to work ok. Should I be worried, and is this typical? Just makes the build feel cheap.</Content>
