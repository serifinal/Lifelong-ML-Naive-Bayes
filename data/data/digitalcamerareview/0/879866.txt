		<Content>We did some resolution measurements on a Canon SD850 IS (SD850 for short) camera using wedge test patterns. With any digital camera or digital picture, expressing resolution in "lines" or requires multiplying by a de-rating factor called the Kell Factor. This is a subjective number, and generally 0.7 is used. So, given the 3264x2448 pixel format, the theoretical resolution in lines for the SD850 would be expected to be 2448 x 0.7 or about 1715 lines or dots across the shorter picture dimension (the picture height). (All resolution measurements must state a reference distance. One line pair equals one black line and the white space next to it; one television line is either one black line or one white space.) The first diagram is a composite made from a test shot taken at widest angle. Sure enough, the softening in the corners as reported by other Canon SD850 reviewers is evident. In the middle, the resolution appears to exceed the number (1715 lines per picture height) we stated above, so perhaps our choice of Kell factor is not entirely accurate. Or perhaps where on the test pattern prior to extinction (blur out) the measurement should be made is also open to debate. In the little wedges, tick marks (not uniformly spaced) can be seen. Halfway between the third and fourth tick marks from the narrow end represents about 1750 lines of resolution. The fourth tick mark represents a little over 1500 lines. Halfway between the fourth and fifth tick marks represents about 1300 lines. The fifth tick mark represents about 1150 lines. The entire diagram should occupy 900x900 pixels which will require scrolling on most monitors. The test field of view itself was 12 by 8 feet. I should mention that the shooting distance was about 14 feet and there may be camera performance differences (which we did not measure yet) compared with shooting (distant) landscapes. Test pattern wedges were placed near the corners, about two and a half feet in from the corners (two feet from the side and 18 inches up or down), and at the center. To reduce file size, the overall diagrams were made by cutting and pasting and are not to scale. We took several pictures with varying zoom amounts between 1x and 2x. Given the somewhat arbitrary position of the test patterns, we can consider the middle portion, slightly less than 50% of the picture area, defined by cropping the upper 1/6 and lower 1/6 and cropping the left 1/6 and right 1/6. Almost all of the time, the resolution in this middle portion, we felt, was better than 1600 lines. And most of the time we judged over 1700 lines.</Content>
