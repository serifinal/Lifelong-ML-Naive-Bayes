		<Content>Hitting us today with a quartet of new cameras, Canon is adding a new camera to their G lineup and three new cameras to the Digital ELPH line. The Canon Powershot G7 is an advanced 10 megapixel camera with a 6x stabilized optical zoom and 2.5 inch LCD. The Canon Powershot SD800 IS is a successor to the popular SD700 IS with a 7.1 megapixel sensor, wide angle lens (28mm), 3.8x stabilized optical zoom, and 2.5 inch LCD. The new top of the line Canon Powershot SD900 features 10 megapixels, a titanium body, 3x optical zoom, and 2.5 inch LCD. The Canon Powershot SD40 is a followup to the SD30, and comes in four colors. All of these new cameras include a new processor from Canon, aptly named the DIGIC III processor. The DIGIC III processor is supposed to speed up startup, autofocus, and shutter response as well as better image quality and power management. Also, all four of the new cameras feature a new Face Detection system from Canon. Their system can detect up to 9 faces in a frame and adjust the camera settings accordingly. Canon Powershot G7 It's been a while since we've seen a new model in Canon's G line. The G7 is targeted at someone looking for SLR performance in a non-SLR camera and at $599, it's about the same price as well. The G7 shoots at up to 10 megapixels of resolution. The 6x optical zoom lens (equivalent to 35-210mm) has Canon's lens shift image stabilization system. To review your images, you can use the 2.5 inch, 207K pixel LCD. (view large image) The new DIGIC III processor provides better noise reduction, allowing the camera to shoot at sensitivities up to ISO 1600. You can control the ISO range (from 80-1600) using a dial on the top of the camera. A new face detection system can detect and focus on up to 9 faces in your pictures. A full complement of manual modes and scene modes provide plenty of shooting options. Canon has also added the My Colors features that have been showing up on their other cameras. The Canon Powershot G7 will be available in October 2006 for $599. Additonal features: 1 cm macro Record movies at 1024 x 768 (15 fps) or 640 x 480 (30 fps) until 4GB file size or 1 hour time limit is reached Hot shoe for external flash Compatible with SD/SDHC/MMC memory media Uses lithium-ion battery pack, good for 220 shots For more details, see: http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=144&modelid=14321 Canon Powershot SD800 IS The SD800 IS is the first followup to the SD700 IS which was the first SD model with image stabilization. With a slightly different lens on the SD800 IS, the camera has a 35mm equivalent wide angle of 28mm. The lens has a total of a 3.8x optical zoom. That whole 28mm-with-image-stabilization thing may look familiar as we've seen it before on the Panasonic FX line of compact digital cameras. (view large image) The SD800 IS sensor can capture 7.1 megapixels. The stainless steel body also houses the 2.5 inch, 207K pixel LCD. The SD800 also gets the new Face Detection system (and DIGIC III processor). The lithium-ion battery is good for 270 shots and images can be stored on SD and SDHC memory media. The SD800 IS will be available in October for $399.

The lens provides a 3x optical zoom (equivalent to 37-111mm) and the camera has a 2.5 inch, 207K pixel LCD. The major upgrades to previous non-IS SD models would be the sensor resolution, new processor, and some new shooting features.

The SD40 is an upgrade to last year's SD30. The SD40 also has the new processor and Face Detection system that we've seen on the other new models. It's also available in four colors: Twilight Sepia, Precious Rose, Noble Blue, and Olive Grey.
