		<Content>I've recently purchased my new digital camera, and I'm still trying to learn all I can about it. Yesterday I set up some lights to try out some portait-style photographs, using 3 point lighting. After I snapped a few photos of my daughter, I shot some video, and went through each of my ISO settings because I wanted to study the results of each ISO setting in that particular lighting. When I was done with all that, I got the idea to shut off my Key light and Fill light, and leave just the back-light on my daughter, to try out that back-lit look you see on TV when somebody is sharing information but doesn't want to be identified (usually they'll alter the sound of the person's voice too). The problem I wound up having, was that the camera was automatically adjusting to the darkness, and I could never quite achieve the look I was going for (even after multiple changes to the position of the back light, which I did many times trying to get the lighting just right)... I only realized that the camera was adjusting this automatically, this morning, when I reviewed the video I had shot yesterday. Everytime I walked around to shut off lights and adjust the back light, the camera adjusted to the lighting levels and by the time I got back to look at the display screen, my daughters face was still clearly visible... I have been goingthrough my owner's manual to try to figure out how I can control this function, however... I don't know what this problem I'm having, is called. I am more than willing to spend my time learning how to fix the problem, if I can just figure out what the issue is called.</Content>
