		<Content>In a press release today, Canon announced the launch of a new consumer-level DSLR, the Digital Rebel XSi (a.k.a. EOS 450D). The new offering features a 12.2 megapixel CMOS sensor at its core, supported by Canon's DIGIC III processing. In terms of shooting speed, the new Rebel is capable to 3.5 frames per second for 53 full-res JPEGS (or 6 RAW images), and a 9-point wide-area AF system promises to speed things up as well. In other news, the new camera features a 3-inch LCD with live view functionality &ndash; a first for Canon's consumer-level DSLR lineup. A 30 fps feed onto the screen, combined with a display that promises to be 50 percent brighter than the one seen on the Digital Rebel XTi, should provide a sufficiently pleasant on-screen shooting experience. Canon is getting into the dynamic range adjustment/expansion game as well, with the announcement of an Auto Lighting Optimizer designed to correct highlight and contrast issues during in-camera image processing.Similarly, Canon has finally opted to get on board with the dominance of SD/SDHC in comsumer digital cameras, with the new Rebel supporting these formats rather than the CF cards seen in previous Digital Rebel models. Announced pricing is $799 for the camera body only, or $899 for a kit including Canon's new 18-55mm image stabilized zoom. Look for the new Rebel in stores come April.Canon Digital Rebel XSi (EOS 450D) specifications:Sensor12.2 megapixel, 22.2x14.8mm CMOSZoomN/ALCD/Viewfinder3.0", 230K-pixel TFT LCD with live view; Pentamirror optical viewfinder with diopter adjustment SensitivityISO 100-1600Shutter Speed30-1/4000 secondsShooting ModesAuto, Program, Program, Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority, Scene, Manual Scene PresetsPortrait, Landscape, Close-Up, Sports, Night Portrait, Flash OffWhite Balance SettingsAuto, Daylight, Shade, Cloudy, Tungsten, Fluorescent, Flash, CustomMetering ModesEvaluative, Partial, Center-Weighted, SpotFocus ModesAI Focus, AI Servo, One Shot, ManualDrive ModesSingle, Continuous, Self Timer, Self Timer ContinuousFlash ModesAuto, Forced On, Force Off, Red-Eye Reduction Self Timer Settings10 seconds, 2 seconds, Off Memory FormatsSD, SDHC Internal Memory None File FormatsJPEG, RAWMax.
