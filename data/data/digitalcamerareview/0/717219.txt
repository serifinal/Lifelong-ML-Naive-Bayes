		<Content>Recently I have encountered short battery life with my Canon A590 Powershot. By short life I mean 20 or less pix with newly charged NiMH batteries: Duracell 2650 mAh & Harbor Freight 2000 & 2200 mAh batt. Actually the HF batt give me a little more pix. All batt have been charged less than 100 times. All batt work fine in other applications, BUT NOT THE A590. However if I use Energizer Ultimate Lithium I get a lot more pix. They don't drain as the NiMH batt seem to do. I have 2 chargers & have eliminated them as a source of trouble. Any I ideas on what is causing this premature drain? Thanks,</Content>
