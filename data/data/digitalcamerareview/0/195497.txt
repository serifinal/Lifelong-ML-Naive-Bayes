		<Content>Hi, Ive had Canon Powershot SX20 IS for nearly six months. Im quite happy with it. But today I noticed that some pictures show a notable red dot in the exact same place. Depending on light or sth else, the red dot is more visible. On other pictures I cant find it. On some I can. The place never changes. So, Id like to know if that is the so-called matrix fault? A warranty job? Or its just something that I shouldnt care about?</Content>
