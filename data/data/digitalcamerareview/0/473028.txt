		<Content>I'm currently working through a review of the Olympus Stylus 750. This camera was one of four new cameras added to Olympus' weatherproof Stylus line back in August (the others were the 730, 740, and 1000). All of the new Stylus' have their own "slot" in the marketplace, but the thing that sets the 750 apart from the rest is that it's the first Stylus to include an optical image stabilization mechanism. Olympus uses a CCD-shifting mechanism to reduce blur when shooting at slower shutter speeds.(view large image)The Olympus Stylus 750 has a 7.1 megapixel capture resolution, a 5x optical zoom, and a 2.5 inch LCD. The camera is sealed against weather and dust. While this model is not "waterproof", it can handle a rain shower.(view large image)Since we'll be publishing a full review soon, I wanted to give my first thoughts about the camera. The styling and design is pretty much exactly the same as the previously generation of Stylus cameras, with a silver, scratch-resistant finish and slim, tapered design. The Stylus cameras are sturdy and well built.I'm very happy to see some sort of optical image stabilization in the compact Olympus cameras. While the image stabilization system doesn't have as many options as other cameras, it still does its job. For example, you can't "preview" the image stabilization - the IS only activates when you press the shutter button all the way down.Having a slightly longer zoom (5x optical) is also a nice feature of this camera. So far, the battery life seems good and camera performance is average to good.Stay tuned for our full review which we'll have for you soon. If you have any questions about this model, use the "Discuss" link at the top or bottom to post your question and we'll try to address it in our full review.</Content>
