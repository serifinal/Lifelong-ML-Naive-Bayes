		<Content>I am having a hard time finding the a620 from a reputable retailer and I was told that it has been discontinued. Newegg and Buy.com both list it as on back order. Is there a good reason Canon stopped making it, especially since the A700 is not a perfect replacement (i.e. no articulating LCD)?</Content>
