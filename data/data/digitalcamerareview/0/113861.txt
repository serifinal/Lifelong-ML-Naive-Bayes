		<Content>Any ideas on cleaning your camera? I've noticed dark areas on pictures that have to be dust somewhere in my camera. I clean my lenses all the time so I don't think the dust is there. If there is a thread pertaining to this topic I'm sorry, please direct me to it. If not, I'd love some ideas before I dive in with a lens cloth wiping stuff that should not be wiped. Thanks, Andrew</Content>
