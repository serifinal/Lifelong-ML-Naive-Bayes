		<Content>I had a Canon G10 and now I have a G12 Power Shot. With both cameras I have the same problem, using the internal flash, in low light conditions peoples faces are washed out, definitions are flat even at 8ft. I ma using Auto settings and 4:3x10M size pictures. Am I asking for too much, or having the wrong settings? External SPEEDLITE 270EX or-so solved the problem.</Content>
