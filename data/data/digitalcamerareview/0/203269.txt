		<Content>I'm a new SLR user - purchased my S2 IS a couple of years ago and have spotty results (am sure it is user error not the camera ..). Many pics are blurry - camera doesn't seem to react to slight movements with subjects. Any tips on what settings I should check/alter would be appreciated! I'm almost at the point to going back to a point and shoot model as I think I'm over my head with this SLR</Content>
