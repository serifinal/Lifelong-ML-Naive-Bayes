		<Content>Hi, Has somebody this problem? I am using Canon S5 IS to take time series pictures. The camera takes and corrects images every 10 seconds in 24 hours. After 5 days the camera turned off itself. What 's happened? Is there the problem with ccd sensor or another problem? Thanks for your answer.</Content>
