		<Content>Hi there, Can you explain me something for this green dot on the image. The green dot appears only when I focus directly to the sun or some strong reflection of the sun . Look at the image >>> http://img182.imageshack.us/img182/9818/img2031.jpg . Is it any problem with my Canon PowerShot SX100 IS or no? I hope you'll help me ________________ http://zoriv.blog.com.mk/</Content>
