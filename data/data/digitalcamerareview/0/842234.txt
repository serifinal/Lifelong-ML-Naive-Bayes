		<Content>Am I the only 1 was this problem? I cannot see the LCD screen out of doors. I have tried brightening the screen and even using my hand to block the sunlight, but to no avail. Most of my photos are either off-center or are ruined. How do you guys use the screen? Indoors or on cloudy days, there's no problem. I am tired of getting home and having to delete most of my snapshots.</Content>
