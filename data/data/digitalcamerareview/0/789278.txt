		<Content>I am the proud owner of a Canon PowerShot S3 IS. I am not finding how to get the number of photos to display in the viewfinder. Also, I see where I can delete single photos from the camera. I would like to find where I can "delete all" after downloading to my computer. Your assistance is appreciated.</Content>
