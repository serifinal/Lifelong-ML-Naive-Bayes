		<Content>I recently purchased an SX30 as a second camera. Wow its one heck of a bang for the buck. But it has a strange problem..... When I review photos for longer than 60 seconds, and then press the key to go back to shooting mode the camera shuts off. If I review photos for 30 seconds this doesn't happen. Is this a design feature, a design flaw, or a problem with my camera? Thx</Content>
