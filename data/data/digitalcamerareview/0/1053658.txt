		<Content>When you buy an ultra compact digital camera, the last thing you want from a protective sleeve is bulk. At the same time though, you don't want to sacrifice protection either. The Lowepro Slider family of cases for digital cameras does a great job of protection in a slim profile, all at a reasonable price. Lowepro Slider Specs Three colors -- red, black, slate grey Three sizes: Slider 10 - 2.1" x .8" x 4" Slider 20 - 2.7" x .9" x 3.7" Slider 30 - 3" x 1" x 3.5" Water resistant outer shell Soft lined interior Stretch gusset with magnetic clip Removable belt clip [larger] Design and Usability Our review unit was a red Slider 20, designed to work with our Sony Cyber-shot T33 (among other cameras). The camera slipped in well, practically like the sleeve was designed for it. The gusset wraps over the top and secures via magnetic clip to keep the camera secure inside the sleeve. The sides and the bottom of the case stretch, but the stretch areas are recessed a little bit, which offers protection from direct impact. The case itself is very strong. While it's not rigid, is it very firm and will certainly protect well in the event of a drop or other impact. [larger] The back of the case has a metal belt clip. I don't happen to be a belt clip guy, but I actually use it to keep the camera in place in my backpack, where it spends most of its time. Lowepro wisely designed the clip to be removable, so with a little push it's easy to remove the clip for an even more slim profile. [larger] Conclusion I've spent over a week with the Slider 20 and don't see any reason to use anything else. It's a perfect fit for my needs, something that protects will, but doesn't take up excess space or add much weight. The soft interior lining will also protect the camera case and LCD from those inevitable nicks and scratches unprotected cameras will pick up. The Slider 20 retails for $20, a small price to pay to protect an investment of a few hundred dollars or more. Pros Three sizes for a great fit Well designed removable clip Excellent protection without bulk and weight Cons Limited fabric and color options Bottom LineIf you buy an ultra compact camera, you need a sleeve to protect it. The Lowepro Slider does a fantastic job and is well worth the purchase. Purchase InformationVisit the Lowepro site to find retailers in your area. All three sizes retail for around $20.</Content>
