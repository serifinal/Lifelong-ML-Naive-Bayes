		<Content>Hello, I have had my first digital camera (SD750) for about two weeks now and have read the manuals cover to cover numerous times and done lots of experimenting. I figured out that I don't have a lag taking the shot if I hold down my shutter to focus ... then compose & shoot. But it still takes what seems like FOREVER to take my next shot because the picture I have just take displays on the LCD screen forever! What setting have I overlooked that can be changed to shorten and/or eliminate the display of the photo just taken? Thank in advance.</Content>
