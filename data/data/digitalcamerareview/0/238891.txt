		<Content>I love my S3. It takes great shots with lots of light available. However, I need to shoot my sons in high school sports-football and track--at night, under stadium lights. The shots are blurry, and I've been told I need a Rebel XTI. Spending that kind of cash, and sitting in crowded bleachers is just not my idea of fun. any advice would be welcome. Maybe I am not using the settings correctly? Thanks!</Content>
