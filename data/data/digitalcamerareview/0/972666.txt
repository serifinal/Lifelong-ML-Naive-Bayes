		<Content>At this year's PhotoPlus Expo, Lowepro came prepared to satisfy the wishes of the professional photographer.&#160; Joining two smaller models, they added a new Slingshot 300 AW sling backpack to accomodate larger professional camera bodies with an attached long zoom lens.&#160;(view large image)At last year's show, Lowepro introduced the Slingshot 100 AW and 200 AW.&#160; With a highly functional sling design, photographers can move quickly from &#8220;carry&#8221; to &#8220;shoot&#8221;.&#160; However, the first two bags weren&#8217;t quite large enough for professionals with larger bodies and a larger stable of lenses.&#160; The bags also included a weatherproof cover that stows away in a hidden pouch.Lowepro responded by introducing the Slingshot 300 AW, which is large enough to hold a &#8220;pro&#8221; camera body and five to six additional lenses, flash units, memory cards and personal accessories.&#160; To handle the larger weight, a waist strap was added.I stopped by Lowepro&#8217;s booth at the show to get a tour of the bag.&#160; While it&#8217;s &#8220;just&#8221; a larger version of the previously introduced bags, they didn&#8217;t just increase the dimensions of the bag.&#160; They paid attention to how the bag would change.&#160; It&#8217;s going to carry more, so they added a waist strap.&#160; Since a standard padded waist strap could get in the way in &#8220;shoot&#8221; mode, they added something as simple as a seam so that the strap would fold.&#160; A strap acts as a zipper stop so the main pouch doesn&#8217;t open accidentally to dump your stuff.&#160; So, overall, I was pretty impressed with the bag.The Slingshot 300 AW has an MSRP of $129 and will start to be available, in limited quantities at first, in about 3 weeks.(view large image)(view large image)(view large image)</Content>
