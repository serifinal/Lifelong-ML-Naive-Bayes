		<Content>Working in tandem with its new DSLR releases, Pentax has announced the addition of five new DA-series lenses to its lineup. New glass includes two additions to the DA* line of high-end lenses, a new limited macro lens, and an improved version of the company's 18-55mm kit lens. SMC Pentax DA* 200mm f/2.8 ED(IF) SDMPentax's DA* 200mm is one of two new DA* models expanding the firm's premium prime telephoto options. The new lens features a super-sonic SDM focusing motor for rapid, near-silent focusing, a maximum aperture of f/2.8, and CA-compensating ED glass elements. As with previous models in this series, the DA* 200mm is weather and dust resistant.SMC Pentax DA* 300mm f/4 ED(IF) SDMIf 200mm simply isn't enough range, Pentax is also rolling out a new 300mm, f/4 variant in the DA* series. As with the 200mm version, the lens features SDM drive, Quick Shift Focus System for rapidly changing between manual and auto focus, ED lens elements, and Pentax's protective SD coating. The nearly mandatory (we dare you to hand-hold this lens) tripod mount is included. SMC Pentax DA 35mm f/2.8 Macro LimitedThe latest offering in Pentax's Limited series of lenses, this 35mm macro unit provides range roughly equivalent to a 50mm version in the familiar 35mm format. Key features include high-grade aluminum construction, SP coating, and Quick Shift Focus System flexibility.SMC Pentax DA 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AL II The new kit lens, designed for Pentax's K20D, looks nearly identical to the original version, but has been optically redesigned to provide the kind of performance mandated by the K20D's 14.6 megapixel sensor As with its predecessor, the 18-55mm provides an ideal zoom range for everyday shooting situations, and the updated model includes spherical lens elements for distortion correction and SP coating for glass protection. SMC Pentax DA 55-300mm f/4-5.8 EDProviding a moderate to extreme telephoto complement to Pentax's kit lenses, this lens covers a range equivalent to roughly 80-450mm in traditional 35mm format. Pentax's SD coating protects the front and rear lens elements, and the lens supports instant-switch Quick Shift Focus technology.No official word from Pentax at press time on pricing or anticipated sales release dates for any of these models.</Content>
