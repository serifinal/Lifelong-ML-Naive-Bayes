		<Content>With the November buying season now behind us, a lot of affordable models either appeared (or reappeared) on our list. For example, the Sony T70, a cheaper alternative to the very popular T200, made it on the list. Also, cameras that had dropped off our list, like the Canon SD1000, had its popularity surge since there were some excellent sale prices around Thanksgiving. This list of cameras shows you what visitors of DigitalCameraReview.com looked at over the past month. The rankings are determined by the number of times a particular product page is viewed by our users.
