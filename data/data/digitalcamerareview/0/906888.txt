		<Content>My problem relates to my Power Shot SX130IS. When using outside in the sun I get a mirror reflection and can't see the subject. I just have to guess what I have focused on. The camera takes great pictures, but this is a real problem outdoors. Tried NuShield DayVue film, but that didn't help. Any suggestions would be appreciated.</Content>
