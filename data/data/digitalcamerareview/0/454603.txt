		<Content>Hi Guys Which Camera To Buy A canon Sx30 Is Or A nikon Coolpix P500 ? Either Goes For $350 ! Please Be Generous In Comparison ! For $350 I Would Like My Camera To Do Everything Nothing Less. I Might Be Sometimes Concerned In Baby Shooting ! They Always Unpredictably Moving Suddenly. Their Smily Faces Could Only Last A Second ! Thanks</Content>
