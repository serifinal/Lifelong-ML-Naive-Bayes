		<Content>I just purchased a cannon powers shot sd850 is, I love the camera but I am running into a lot of problems when I try to use the videos I took. The format MVI is not compatible with the windows movie maker or even windows media player. I spent several hours searching the web for converters but all they do is produce a video with a gray screen and the audio. Has anyone else run into this problem? I tried contacting customer support and all they said was search the web. I am becoming very frustrated. Any help would be much appreciated. Rainekbaker@hotmail.com</Content>
