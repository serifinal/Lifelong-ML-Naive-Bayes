		<Content>RE: Canon PowerShot SD1300 IS I take photos of diamonds using Macro Mode. The first pictures I took were perfect. Then I changed the factory settings. What are the factory settings for White balance, etc? The photo on the left was taken before I changed settings. The photo on the right was taken after I changed settings. I need to return to all the factory settings. Thanks,</Content>
