		<Content>I bought a canon rebel xt a few months ago. I enjoy using the camera...I was wondering if anybody knew if there is a black and white mode? I read in the manuel that there was that option under the menu...but when i go through my camera options, it doesn't appear. Is there something additional that i need to buy? THanks for any input.</Content>
