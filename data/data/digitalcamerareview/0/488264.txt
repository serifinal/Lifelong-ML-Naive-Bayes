		<Content>In the DigitalCameraReview.com forums last week, one of our members posted about stumbling upon a one-off Canon SD model on Target.com. As it turns out, the PowerShot SD1100 IS Digital ELPH that leaked out on the retailer's site was actually one of a batch of pre-PMA releases from Canon announced late this evening. Building on the SD1000, the SD1100 IS updates the "camera brick" styling of the earlier Digital ELPH slightly. The new ultra-compact is also expected to hit the market in four colors &ndash; yet another camera in the recent flurry of releases to offer more personalization than previous versions.Technologically, the 8 megapixel SD1100 features a familiar-looking 3x optical zoom and a 2.4-inch LCD. Optical image stabilization is showing up on nearly every new PowerShot models, and the SD1100 is no exception. Sensor sensitivity tops out at ISO 1600.Per Canon, expect to pay around $250 for the SD1100 when it goes up for sale in March.Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS specifications: Sensor8.0 megapixel, 1/2.5" CCDZoom3x (38-114mm) zoom, f/2.8-4.9LCD/Viewfinder2.5", 230K-pixel TFT LCDSensitivityISO 80-1600Shutter Speed15-1/1500 secondsShooting ModesAuto, Manual, Digital Macro, Landscape, Portrait, Night Snapshot, Color Accent, Color Swap, Stitch Assist, Movie Scene PresetsIndoor, Kids & Pets, Sunset, Foliage, Snow, Beach, Fireworks, Night Scene, Aquarium, UnderwaterWhite Balance SettingsAuto, Daylight, Cloudy, Tungsten, Fluorescent, Fluorescent H, CustomMetering ModesEvaluative, Center, SpotFocus Modes9-Point AF, Face Detection AF, Spot AF, Face Select and Track Drive ModesNormal Only Flash ModesAuto, Forced On, Slow Synchro, Forced Off, Red-Eye Reduction Self Timer Settings10 seconds, 2 seconds, Off Memory FormatsSD, SDHC Internal Memory None File FormatsJPEG, AVI, WAVMax.
