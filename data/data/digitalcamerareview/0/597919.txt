		<Content>I am trying to taking a shot with my a510, but am having trouble. The shot I want is of an object, but I want the background to be clear as well. Anyone got any tips on how to do this? Yeah I suppose I could look in the manual, but that seems like a lot of work. Any help appreciated. Thanks.</Content>
