		<Content>Who is looking to buy a camera as a semi proffessional camera mix of SLR and normal digital camera and easy to learn I advice to buy Canon SX1 IS as HD viedo, 2.8 LCD Rotate, 20X zoom and other great options, really a nice camera. I been used before Nikon P80 but when I bought Canon SX1 IS there is no compare between both, with different option's I prefer who is looking to buy a camera try with this.</Content>
