		<Content>I just bought this camera for $299 at Best Buy. I have a couple of issues. First, I took some video and transferred it to my computer. How do I view it? How do I save it? Can I put it on a DVD? Secondly, a lot of my general photos under auto are coming out blurry? Any ideas on the best setting for motion shots? Thanks I am a camera dummy</Content>
