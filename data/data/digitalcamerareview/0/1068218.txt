		<Content>Kodak is providing plenty of reasons for people to visit their booth at this year's CES. They've announced two new digital cameras - Easyshare V803 and Easyshare V1003 - and an entire line of digital photo frames. In addition to the "gadgets", they're also announcing additional services for storing, sharing and organizing your images - their kiosks will now write DVDs, they will have an image backup service via Kodak Gallery, and they're working on software that will be able to scan through your images to find similar faces. Their booth personnel will certainly be hopping with all of this to show off.(view large image)With their camera offerings, Kodak continues to appeal to the female buyer. Market research in the past has shown that female digital camera owners preferred the Kodak brand over any other brand. The digital cameras announced today are available in many colors and have a softer, rounded off design that may appeal to more women. Kodak is also announcing a new service through the online Kodak Gallery service. For a small fee, they will provide an image protection service that will essentially give you a backup of all of your images. If you lose the contents of a hard drive, this service will restore your backed up images.Kodak Easyshare V803(view large image)8 megpixels3x optical zoom2.5 inch LCDHigh ISO scene mode22 pre-programmed scene modesVGA (640x480) movie capture at 30 frames per second32MB internal memory and SD/MMC memory card slotLithium-ion batteryMultiple colors and available fashion accessoriesRetail for $199Kodak Easyshare V100310 megpixels3x optical zoom2.5 inch LCDHigh ISO scene mode (up to ISO 1600)22 pre-programmed scene modesVGA (640x480) movie capture at 30 frames per second32MB internal memory and SD/MMC memory card slotLithium-ion batteryMultiple colors and available fashion accessoriesRetail for $249Kodak Digital Photo FramesThe new digital photo frames from Kodak enforce Kodak's mantra of making it easy to share images.
