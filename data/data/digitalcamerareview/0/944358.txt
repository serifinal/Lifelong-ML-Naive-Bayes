		<Content>I am new at this but I do need help. A month ago I bought SX10IS. Upgrading I thought from a S2IS, but it is not working for me. I can not get macro - super macro to work - either it is focused but washed out too light or it is not focused but right colours - tried a lot of thing but not working- I am about to give up and go back to my old camera</Content>
