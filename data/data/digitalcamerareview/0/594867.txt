		<Content>Have jsut bought a canon 30d and there is a spot on my camera. The lenses are clean and even when I switch lenses the exactly same spot apears in the same place. The mirror is also clean. At a close focal length this is nearly exactly round and at a different focal lenght it apears as a very dark small blob? could this be the sensor? any ideas? any help? thanks</Content>
