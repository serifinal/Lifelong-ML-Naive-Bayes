		<Content>I have a Canon Digital Rebel XTI, I know there is a newer model out. Don't buy the kit lenses, if you get this camera. Instead, check a macro lens or my favourite low light lens, 50mm f/1.8, in Canada, it's about $130, in the US it's around $100. No flash needed, if you have more money, get a 50mm f/1.4.</Content>
