		<Content>Hello. I am a relative digital camera newbie and I just bought a Canon A620 and I can't seem to find any option to set the aspect ratio to 3:2 for taking pics that will be printed as 4x6's. My old Sony had the option (albeit at a lower resolution), which would change the framing window to a 4x6 area. Is the only way to get 4x6's from this camera to take regular shots, then crop to 4x6? This make composing pics difficult. Any tips? PK</Content>
