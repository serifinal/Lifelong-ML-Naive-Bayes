		<Content>The month of December saw a minor reshuffling of our Most Popular Digital Cameras list, with interest in budget models continuing to grow. The top three cameras held their spots from November, and Canon continues to dominate five of the ten spots. Interest in the Sony Cyber-shot T200 has remained strong since its release, and the slightly cheaper Sony T70 has continued to climb the list as well.This list of cameras shows you what visitors of DigitalCameraReview.com looked at over the past month. The rankings are determined by the number of times a particular product page is viewed by our users. The rankings below are from the entire month of December 2007.
