		<Content>Hi, I am a novice to digital cameras and have recently purchased a Canon SX 100 IS. However, I find the image quality blurring ( lack of focus) when I zoom a distant object in the Auto Mode. The focus has to be set by 1/2 clicking the button before taking a picture. I tried another such camera on display at Circuit city and found this issue was not existing there ( the camera was able to correctly focus on full zoom). Is there some setting which I am missing or is there some defect with my camera. Would appreciate an early reply. ~A</Content>
