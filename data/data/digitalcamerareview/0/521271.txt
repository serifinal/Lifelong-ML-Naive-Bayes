		<Content>FOZI credit-card tripod available from Timetable The smallest folding table-top tripods still too big for your taste? Wishing for something closer to credit-card size? The card-thin FOZI Portable Tripod doesn't offer a lot in the way of flexibility, but it's hard to find fault with its portability. The fascinatingly simple concept from Australian manufacturer Timetable uses a die-cut polypropelene card divided into three "naturally hinged" (read: lightly scored) sections. Stair-stepped cuts into each face allow a compact camera &ndash; DSLRs and ultra-zooms need not apply &ndash; to be angled up several degrees. For night or indoor shots or self-portraits, the tiny, super-cheap FOZI may just be as much tripod as some casual shooters need.The whole unit, which folds up to the size of a single credit card and the thickness of about three, is available directly from Timetable via mail-order. Choose one of five different colors for a delivered price of $8.95 AUD &ndash; around $8 in the US at the time of this writing.Firmware upgrade for Olympus 12-60mm lens releasedLast week, Olympus released a firmware upgrade for its Zuiko Digital ED 12-60mm f/2.8-4.0 Silent Wave Drive zoom lens.
