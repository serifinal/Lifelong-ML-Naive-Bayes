		<Content>1. There is a green focus box in auto mode, I can't control what it focuses on.. does that mean if it focuses on something to the right, it won't focus on what I'm point at in the center? 2. I thought this has face detection. I mean it does, but I don't know how to activate it.. it doesn't do the white/gray boxes over faces, how do i do that?</Content>
