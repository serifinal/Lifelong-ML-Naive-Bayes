		<Content>I got a Canon Powershot A95 a couple years ago, to take with me when I went studying abroad. In the beginning, the camera took reasonable quality photos - nothing spectacular - but since last year or so, the image quality has reduced drastically. I don't know much about digital cameras, since I am a film guy...any help on what to do would be great (or even just telling me to throw the piece of junk out). Thanks.</Content>
