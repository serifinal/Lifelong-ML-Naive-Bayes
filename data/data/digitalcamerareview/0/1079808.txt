		<Content>Fujifilm disclosed a new addition to its S series with the top-of-the-line FinePix S100FS (film simulation). Touted as Fuji's most advanced digital camera to date, the S100FS is an SLR-like shooting tool that brings manual controls and other advanced features to users looking for more functionality and flexibility. A thoroughly impressive 14.3x Fujinon zoom lens and an 11 megapixel Super CCD sensor are the cornerstone on which the rest of the camera builds. Fuji's advanced RPIII processor works in conjunction with the CCD to control noise, and we're anticipating that this combination should yield some of the best noise performance results we've seen.On the subject of ISO, the S100FS is able to shoot at ISO 6400 at 6 megapixels, or all the way up to ISO 10,000 at 3 megapixels. This is simply a staggering number, and if the results look anything like a discernible image, we'll be very impressed with the Fuji's performance.Borrowing many of its tech specs from the famed Fuji S5 Pro, the S100FS has three dynamic range settings, allegedly extending capture by up to 400 percent at the maximum selection. Given Fuji's strong history in film, it's not surprising that one of their flagship device would sport the company's Film Simulation technology, which faithfully reproduces the look of several classic films (like Velvia and Portra) according to Fuji.Dual Image Stabilization should make the far reaches of the S100FS's zoom more functional, and a face detection that handles faces shot at off-axis angles more confidently than many systems on the market is also a definitely plus in terms of usability.With a 2.5-inch tiltable LCD that adjusts to a variety of shooting positions and support for both xD-Picture Card and the more common SD and SDHC formats, the S100FS looks like a strong contender in the premium ultra-zoom market.Look for the camera in stores next month, with a price tag around $799.
