		<Content>Hi, I bought Canon powershot - G7 recently. The qulaity is superb but I have a small doubt. When the camera is on and ready to shoot..if I move/tilt it horizantally so that the lcd screen goes up and down I observe small crackling sound. The sound is something like hard disk operational sound. is it some kind of problem....thanks a lot in advance</Content>
