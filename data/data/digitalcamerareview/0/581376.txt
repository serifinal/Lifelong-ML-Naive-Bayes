		<Content>If you find yourself needing to replace or upgrade your camera, we like to profile the most popular cameras on our web site to give you a good idea of what people are considering. The rankings are determined by the number of times a particular product page is viewed by our users. The rankings below are from the entire month of September 2006. Between August and September, there are two new digital SLRs on the list (Nikon D80 and Canon Digital Rebel XTi) and one new point and shoot (Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX2). These three cameras replace the Canon Powershot A700, Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ1, and Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T30 on the list. For additional help while choosing a camera, you can register for our forums and ask as many questions as you want. If you're looking to buy, the best place to start is our Digital Camera Buying Suggestions forum. If you need help with your current camera, then we have forums for each brand that you can post in. 1. Canon Powershot SD600 (previously #1) - One of three new Digital ELPHs introduced last February, the SD600 features 6 megapixels, a 3x optical zoom, and a very nice 2.5 inch LCD. An MSRP of $349 makes this compact camera a pretty good buy. Canon Powershot SD600 Reviews | Canon Powershot SD600 User Opinions 2. Nikon D80 (first time on list) - The Nikon D80 is basically the upgrade to the D70s and occupies the pricking bracket right above the D50. It's one of those models that gets some of the features in its more expensive siblings, the D200 and D2Xs. The D80 can capture 10.2 megapixels, has a 2.5 inch, 230K pixel , LCD, 11 area auto focus system, and 3 frames per second shooting capability. Nikon D80 Reviews | Nikon D80 User Opinions 3. Canon Powershot S3 IS (previously #4) - Announced in February, the S3 IS is an update to the S2 IS. It features a 6 megapixel sensor, 2 inch flip out, rotating LCD, and a 12x stabilized optical zoom. Canon Powershot S3 IS Reviews | Canon Powershot S3 IS User Opinions 4. Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50 (previously #5) - If you've followed Panasonic cameras much, you'll know that their FZ30, predecessor to the FZ50, was very popular. It's no surprise then, that this higher-end ultrazoom has made the list. The FZ50 takes 10.1 megapixel pictures with a stabilized 12x optical zoom. Frame your images on a flip-out, 2 inch LCD. Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50 Reviews | Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50 User Opinions 5. Canon Powershot SD700 IS (previously #2) - The SD700 IS is the first camera in the Digital ELPH line (or SD line) that features Canon's image stabilization. The IS allows you to shoot at much slower shutter speeds to get good indoor pictures without a flash. The camera shoots at 6 megapixels, has a 2.5 inch LCD and a 3x optical zoom. Canon Powershot SD700 IS Reviews | Canon Powershot SD700 IS User Opinions 6. Canon Digital Rebel XT (previously #3) - This digital SLR is the most popular in its class and it's also a favorite among reviewers in its class (along with the Nikon D50). If you're looking to get away from the shutter lag of point and shoot cameras, or you have some Canon lenses that you're aching to use and you don't need a more expensive SLR, the Digital Rebel XT is a good way to go. Canon Digital Rebel XT Reviews | Canon Digital Rebel XT User Opinions 7. Canon Powershot A620 (previously #6) - One of the successors of the popular A95, the A620, with the DIGIC II processor and 2 inch flip out LCD is a fast camera with great image quality. This 7.1 megapixel camera uses 4 AA batteries for great life and stores images on an SD card. Use the 4x optical zoom to get close when you need it. Canon Powershot A620 Reviews | Canon Powershot A620 User Opinions 8. Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX2 (first time in top 10) - The LX2 has lots of fun features that make it attractive. As with all Panasonic cameras, it has the MEGA O.I.S. image stabilization system. The LX2 features a wide-format 10.2 megapixel sensor, a wide-screen 2.8 inch LCD, a 4x optical zoom lens with a wide angle equivalent of 28mm. Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX2 Reviews | Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX2 User Opinions 9. Sony Alpha DSLR-A100 (previously #7) - This first digital SLR from Sony is sure to keep owners of Minolta glass happy as it accepts most Minolta lenses already made. The A100 features a 10.2 megapixel CCD and 2.5 inch LCD with 230K pixels. Sony Alpha DSLR-A100 Reviews | Sony Alpha DSLR-A100 User Opinions 10. Canon Digital Rebel XTi (first time in top 10) - The XTi (also know as the EOS 400D) is Canon's replacement to the almost ubiquitous Canon Digital Rebel. The XTi features 10.1 megapixel resolution, a 2.5 inch, 230K pixel LCD, dust reduction system, and 9 point auto focus system. Also, a relief for some, the XTi still takes CompactFlash media. Canon Digital Rebel XTi Reviews | Canon Digital Rebel XTi User Opinions Falling out of the top 10 most popular cameras from the previous month are the: Canon Powershot A700 (previously #8) Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ1 (previously #9) Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T30 (previously #10) To see our last ranking, see Most Popular Digital Cameras of August 2006.
