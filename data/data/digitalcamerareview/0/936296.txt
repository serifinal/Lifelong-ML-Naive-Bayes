		<Content>I just bought the Rebel t3 bundle with 18x55 and 75x300 lenses. Is there a power zoom on this camera? I can zoom manually and take a picture but when I try to use the zoom buttons it takes the picture from the original view. I have checked the manual and google and I just can't figure it out.</Content>
