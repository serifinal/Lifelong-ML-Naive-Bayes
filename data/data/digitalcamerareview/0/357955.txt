		<Content>Hello, I upgraded from a Canon Power Shot A1100IS to a Canon Power Shot SX30 IS. Will installing the new software for the SX30 IS overwrite the software for the A1100 IS and if so, can I still upload photos from the A1100 IS. I would like to continue using this camera also but am concerned the new software wouldn't be compatible. Thank you.</Content>
