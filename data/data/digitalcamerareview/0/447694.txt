		<Content>When I put the S60 camera is "Auto" mode it displays the movie icon and when I press the shoot button it takes a video clip movie rather than a picture. I've tried re-setting everything to factory/default settings (by holding down the menu button) but it still won't take pictures (only video) in "Auto" mode. Does anyone know how to fix this? Thanks very much.</Content>
