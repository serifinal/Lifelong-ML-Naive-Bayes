		<Content>Leica will be showing off four new digital cameras (and a few lenses) at the Photokina trade show that starts in just a couple days. While three of the models are essentially the same as some Panasonic models, the fourth one, the Leica M8, is the first digital camera to use the Leica viewfinder system. As a side note for the folks in the US, Leica cameras are not widely distributed in North America, so you can mostly just drool. Some models are/will be available, but I don't have definite details about the new models. Leica M8 Features 10.3 megapixel 2.5 inch LCD with 230K pixels Accepts all Leica M lenses with a 1.33x crop factor ISO range of 160-2500 Shutter speed as fast as 1/8000 of a second Hot shoe for an external flash Full manual controls Uses SD/SDHC media Lithium-ion battery Leica DIGILUX 3 The Digilux 3 is essentially the same camera as the Panasonic DMC-L1 with some Leica changes to the image processing. Features 7.5 megapixels Accepts FourThirds lenses Optical image stabilization 2.5 inch, 207K pixel LCD Dust reduction ISO range: 100-1600 Leica V-LUX 1 The V-LUX 1 is essentially the same camera as the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50 with some Leica changes to the image processing. Features 10 megapixels 12x optical zoom, stabilized fixed lens tilting 2 inch, 207K pixel LCD electronic viewfinder hotshoe for external flash full manual modes Leica D-LUX 3 The V-LUX 1 is essentially the same camera as the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX2 with some Leica changes to the image processing.
