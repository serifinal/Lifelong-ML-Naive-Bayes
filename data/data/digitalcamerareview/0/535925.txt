		<Content>I bought my Canon Powershot SD1200IS in May '09. I purchased an Ativa 4GB memory card that was on sale at the same time to use with the camera. My pictures have always looked overexposed (Even when I am not pointing the camera at a light source). I often have to use photoshop to adjust the contrast and color, so that the pictures look decent. Is there a function that I need to adjust on the camera to correct this problem? Could the cheap memory card be the problem? Did I just get a faulty camera? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</Content>
