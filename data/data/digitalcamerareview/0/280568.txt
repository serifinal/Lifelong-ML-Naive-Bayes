		<Content>I recently downloaded Zoombrowser EX 6.5.1 for my Canon Powershot S30 camera. My computer is Windows XP Service Pack 3. When I connected my camera to download pics, it worked great. Now, when I want to view pics to print out or e-mail, the pics are grayed out and say "loading image," and that's it. Can you help me please? Thanks!!</Content>
