		<Content>Just purchased this camera. Do you think the battery will last a day or shooting pictures, say on vacation? Will I need to recharge every day? I had a Nikon a few years ago that ate batteries, it was horrible. I'm hoping this new Canon will be better. This may be a simple question, but not very camera savy here</Content>
