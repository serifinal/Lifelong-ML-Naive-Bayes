		<Content>i just got and started using this camera a few weeks ago. i feel like i had it set to have the flash off by default (though i could be misremembering), but now i can't get it to stay off - i have to manually set it to "off" every time i power the camera on. does anyone know if it's possible to have the default setting for the flash be off? thanks in advance</Content>
