		<Content>Hi - I've recently bought a 1000D (Rebel XS) and a Zeikos 680EX ETTL flash. The flash worked great the first time I put it on the camera. Now, it doesn't fire. The flash Ready light never comes on, the built-in works if I take the Zeikos off. Menu settings have external enabled and TTL mode set. I'm new to digital, but am an experienced 35mm guy. Please help. Thanks.</Content>
