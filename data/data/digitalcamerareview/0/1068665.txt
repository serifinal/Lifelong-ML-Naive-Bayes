		<Content>I bought a Canon SX110 a couple of weeks ago and i noticed that the first bunch of pictures i took had a .jpg file size of between 1.8MB to 2.5MB ..... and then after i fiddles with things a bit the file sizes are much larger now, bgetting up over 5MB. Is this normal? The sizes seem kinda large to me. Taking a variety of color and B&W fotos with different zooms. Will that make a difference in file size? Any other settings that i may have misconfigured? Thanks in advance for the advice! Hugh</Content>
