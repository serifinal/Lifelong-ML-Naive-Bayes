		<Content>My camera is several years old but still takes great photos. However, the only way to take a picture now is using the optical viewfinder as the view screen will not show a picture being taken, but will allow me to view a picture that has already been taken. Any ideas? I am wondering if I somehow changed a setting that I can correct, or is my camera just breaking? Thanks!</Content>
