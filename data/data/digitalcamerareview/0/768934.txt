		<Content>I have a Canon PowerShot SD870 IS. How do you turn the date stamp on? Mine is grayed out so I can't even select it. Also, have problems with memory card. After uploading all the images, I delete them off the memory card. When I insert the memory card back, it says FULL. Why, when I deleted all the images? Please help.</Content>
