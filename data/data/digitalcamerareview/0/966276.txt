		<Content>I have a Canon Rebel XS, and Lightroom 2 on a MacBook OS X 10.4. I would like to plug the camera in (USB) to download my pictures. Lightroom is unable to recognize the RAW files when i download direct from the camera. If I put the card in my card reader, they import fine. I have installed the Canon CD of drivers, etc. Does anyone else have this problem? Is there some setting I'm missing? Please help. Thanks, Evan</Content>
