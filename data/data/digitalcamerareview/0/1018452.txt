		<Content>Hi, I have Canon Power Shot SX110 IS. When I try to transfer images back to memory card I got message that "The image is a JPEG that cannot be displayed on the camera". I have the same message even when I tried to transfer images taken by this camera. Can please anyone advise how to fix this issue. Thanks</Content>
