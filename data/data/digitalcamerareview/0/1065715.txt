		<Content>I just came back from a trip and my photos turned out awesome. Two days later I used my Canon and all the photos turned out blurry. I put the settings back to default and the photos when I use zoom are still blurry. I have recharged my batteries and changed the memory card. Any other suggestions?</Content>
