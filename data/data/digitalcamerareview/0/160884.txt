		<Content>I just got my 800 IS from Beach. Wow.. I ordered it yesterday with free shipping and it was here by 1 PM. packaged beautifully. That is great service !! My question is I am wondering if I should install the software or just use my card reader to transfer pictures and videos? Thanks.</Content>
