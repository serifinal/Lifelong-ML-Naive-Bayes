		<Content>Hi everyone! I am new here. I purchased sx130is one week ago and it is a good point and shoot camera. I have an old film SLR camera with lot of filters. Skylight, Uv, Grey gradient and a very nice polarizer fader( Circular Polarizer). I don't bother about other filters except polarizer fader. Is there any way that i can use this filter with Sx130is? I know i sound like crazy but i sometimes shoot with holding the filter in hand and cloud effects are really nice. Is anyone know how i can use filter with sx130is?</Content>
