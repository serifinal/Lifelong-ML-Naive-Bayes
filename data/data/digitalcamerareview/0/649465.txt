		<Content>Canon Buyer's Guide Are you considering the purchase of a Canon camera? You've come to the right place. I've listed out the most popular and best entries from Canon. See which one fits you best. Prices quoted are street prices, not the expensive list prices that big-box retailers would charge. The Canon Powershot A610 gets a big thumbs up from me as being the most versatile, great value, general-purpose camera that Canon offers. About half of the users who come looking for a Canon camera end up buying an A95. __________________________________________ I want a compact camera for general use. I'd like some manual controls.
