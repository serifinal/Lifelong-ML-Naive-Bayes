		<Content>Two new models in Olympus's Stylus SW series of shockproof/waterproof cameras continue the company's tradition of building devices that can stand up to the elements.The Olympus Stylus 850 SW and Stylus 1030 SW promise to be shockproof, waterproof, freezeproof, and dustproof, providing a high level of protection for outdoor shooting in extreme conditions. Additionally, the 1030 SW is touted as crushproof up to 220 pounds per square foot, and is able to survive drops of up to 6.6 feet. The sealed-body cameras are both capable of being fully submerged &ndash; to depths of 10 feet for the 850 SW, and 33 feet for the 1030 SW. While they may not be ready for photographing your next scuba expedition without a waterproof housing, both should provide adequate protection for snorkeling in most cases. Both cameras are also fully functional down to 14 degrees Fahrenheit, and the sealed bodies eliminate concerns about shooting in sandy or dusty environments as well.Both cameras offer the range of new features seen in the rest of the updated Stylus family, including face detection, digital image stabilization, in-camera panorama, and dynamic range optimizing Shadow Adjustment Technology. The Stylus 1030 SW also features Olympus's TruePic III image processor, and a 2.7-inch, second-generation HyperCrystal LCD with a contrast ratio of more than 180 percent and improved color reproduction. The 8.0 megapixel 850 SW has an internally contained 3x zoom, while the 10.1 megapixel 1030 SW is fitted with a similar 3.6x unit with wide-angle flexibility. The Stylus 850 SW will be available this month, priced around $299.99. Expect the Stylus 1030 SW in March, hitting stores with a retail price around $399.99.
