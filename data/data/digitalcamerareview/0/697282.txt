		<Content>Just bought a Canon SD1400. When getting ready to take a photo, the camera is trying to focus and keeps making a 'ticking' noise. It seems like this is taking way too long. I am pressing down half way as instructed on all these p & s cameras. Is this normal for the SD1400...anyone have one and know this??</Content>
