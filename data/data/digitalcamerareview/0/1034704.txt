With features like manual modes, RAW capture capability, the SP cameras offer plenty of creative control. They are also built to accept lens accessories that can be screwed onto the threaded barrel. The UZ cameras offer the longer zoom ranges that aren't available on the other SP models. Besides increasing the capture resolution in the SP-510, Olympus has also improved the auto focus speed (30% faster) and improved battery performance to over 500 shots.
