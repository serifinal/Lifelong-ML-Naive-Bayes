		<Content>Pentax made official what many have suspected for several months today, with the release of its new K20D and K200D digital SLRs.14.6 megapixel K20D finally officialThe heavily rumored K20D (which was all but confirmed when what was believed to be its technology-sharing Samsung counterpart appeared briefly by mistake on a Norwegian website earlier this month) brings the impressive specs many were hoping for. Pentax's collaboration with Samsung infuses the camera with a 14.6 megapixel CMOS sensor &ndash; the highest resolution yet seen on a Pentax K digital. Other key features and specs include a 2.7-inch display and a live view system, allowing shooters to compose their images on-screen rather than through the viewfinder only. Six user-customizable image style modes provide greater flexibility in adjusting image look and feel in camera.Pentax also claims to have improved their PRIME image processor and in-body Shake Reduction image stabilization system. Likewise, an expanded dynamic range function improves the camera's overall capture ability in high-contrast lighting situations. Coming in as the highest-resolution semi-pro camera yet seen, the K20D promises to provide almost everything Pentax shooters had asked for in improving on the venerable K10D. Still, we can't help but be a little disappointed that maximum continuous shooting speed still lags behind the class leaders, at 3 fps.The K20D should hit markets in April for $1299.95 in kit form only, with an optically redesigned Pentax 18-55mm lens.K10D remade in smaller K200D formTaking its compact shape and size from its K100D predecessor, and most of its technical specs from the semi-pro K10D, the K200D looks to provide significant power in a compact DSLR. The 10.2 megapixel camera uses the K10D's sensor setup. As with some previous models, the K200D is also weather-sealed and dustproof. Six custom image functions provide presets for image look and feel, with further adjustments for saturation, sharpness, and contrast available. As with the K20D, the K200D offers an expanded dynamic range function as well. As with the K100D, the K200D will retain AA battery power. The addition of an accessory battery grip option combined with the use of lithium cells, however, promises an impressive 1100 shots from the new entry-level Pentax.Variants, expected for sale by March, include the $799.95 kit with Pentax's new 18-55mm lens, and the $719.95 body-only version.Pentax K20D specifications:Sensor14.6 megapixel, 23.4x15.6mm CMOS ZoomN/ALCD/Viewfinder2.7", 230K-pixel TFT LCD with Live View; Pentaprism optical viewfinder with diopter adjustment SensitivityISO 100-6400Shutter Speed30-1/4000 secondsShooting ModesGreen, Program, Sensitivity Priority, Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority, Shutter and Aperture Priority, Metered Manual, X Speed, Bulb, UserScene PresetsN/AWhite Balance SettingsAuto, Daylight, Shade, Cloudy, Tungsten, Fluorescent W, Fluorescent D, Fluorescent N, Flash, Color Temperature, Manual Metering ModesMulti, Center-Weighted, SpotFocus ModesAF Single, AF Continuous, Manual; Auto, User-Selected Point, Center Drive ModesSingle, Continuous High, Continuous Low, Burst, Remote, Remote Continuous, Auto Bracket, Extended Bracket, Multi-Exposure, IntervalFlash ModesOn, Red-Eye, Slow Sync, Slow Sync + Red-Eye, Trailing Curtain Sync, Wireless Self Timer Settings10 seconds, 2 seconds, Off Memory Formats SD, SDHC Internal Memory None File FormatsJPEG, RAW (PEF/DNG)Max.
