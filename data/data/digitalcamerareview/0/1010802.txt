		<Content>Hi again....Is there a way to load photos on CD from different dates. At the moment on Zoombrowser EX I can only load one set of photos (from a download) but cant figure out how to add a previous set downloaded on a different date. I tried holding the Ctrl button to pick up a previous shoot but it doesn't work. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance.</Content>
