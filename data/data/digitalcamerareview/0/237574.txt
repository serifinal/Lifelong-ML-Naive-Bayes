		<Content>I have a Canon camcorder (iVIS HF R10). I have no problem taking videos with it but I am really disappointed at how the pictures come out using this camera. Especially when the room is dark. The camera has no flash. I of course change the mode so that it takes brighter pictures in the dark but the photo looks bad. Please help!</Content>
