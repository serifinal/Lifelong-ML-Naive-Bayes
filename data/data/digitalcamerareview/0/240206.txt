		<Content>Panasonic has jumped the gun on even the pre-PMA announcement field with the release of a new basic compact: the Lumix LS80S.The release of this super-simple, user-friendly 8.1 megapixel compact hit the web today with about as much fanfare as could be expected for an entry level camera. The features set covers the basics: 1/2.5-inch CCD, ISO from 100 to 1600, 3x zoom, and 2.5-inch screen. The AA-powered digicam offers a limited range of user controls, focusing heavily on its scene and Intelligent Auto modes.The device is capable of capturing 16:9 (848x480) video clips at 30 fps as well. The addition of Panasonic's MEGA O.I.S. optical image stabilization system is a plus, potentially previewing just how far down into many manufacturer's lineups such technology may extended this release season. No word on pricing or expected shelf release dates, but the LS80S is already showing up on Panasonic's website. Assuming the price comes in where we think it will, the LS80S, with its IS system, could offer some serious competition to perennial low-budget thumpers like Nikon's L series.
