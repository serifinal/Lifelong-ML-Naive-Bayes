		<Content>Just bought a used Canon Powershot S2 off E-bay. I'm trying to format the memory card. When I scroll through to select the "format" mode, it is blacked out and I can't select it. I've tried two different cards, one a universal and one a Canon (from previous camera) and neither will work. Did I just get screwed or am I missing something?</Content>
