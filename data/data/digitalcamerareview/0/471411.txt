		<Content>Most of Canon top models are long in tooth and need to have better specs. S5IS- i think should have a 12X Zoom starting from 28mm eq. A series Powershots need to start from 28 or 30mm eq. and i think canon must move all compact digital ELPH,s to 28-140mm a la W-150, W-170 from Sony. 35mm is just not wide enough wide and 28mm is almost a must. Lots of Canon clients will migrate to Panasonic and Sony- who have proven themselves more fleet footed!</Content>
