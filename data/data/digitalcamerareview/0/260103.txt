		<Content>I have a EOS Digital Rebel that is about 2 years old. I always set my camera image quality to Large/Fine which saves images at 300dpi. For some reason my images are now saving at 180dpi - but the setting is still Large/Fine. Has anyone had a similiar problem? How can I get back to a high resolution image?</Content>
