		<Content>Hello people, My SD700 IS - is giving me some hard time lately. The screen goes black when I turn it on, menu and all button appear to be there, but its as if the shutter is closed. Sometimes it help when I turn it off and on again. But lately I haven't been able to take any shots or videos at all.... I'm thinking maybe its some kind of a computer problem, maybe a new firmware or a hard reset will help. Any suggestions? any ideas where I can get the firmware? I tried canon website but with no luck. Thanks ahead,</Content>
