		<Content>I bought Powershot G7 Digital Camera for just $419.00 from Planetonline. It is for serious photography enthusiasts who have a lot to be excited about. It includes 10 megapixel resolution and a powerful 6x optical zoom and also includes an Optical Image Stabilizer for clear shots throughout the zoom range.</Content>
