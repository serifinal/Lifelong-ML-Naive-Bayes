		<Content>I was looking for an HD camcorder, read about the Nikon D90, was stunned by the Canon 5D Mark II. I had to know more. The SX1 records HD at 40-45Mb/sec, 5-5.6 MB/s, which is why it needs a Class 6 memory for video. That is the same as the 5DM2 and 60% to double other camcorders and cameras including the Panasonic GH-1. It uses the very effective AVCHD protocol, were the Nikon and older cameras used MJPEG, an MPEG2 protocol similar to HDV. Why are all the cameras peaking in the 17-25Mb/s range? Because the 1990s DV tape protocol was 25Mb/s, a physical limit of the tape drives. HDV was designed to use the same tape drives, however interframe MPEG2 gave an advantage over intraframe DV. AVCHD was to allow recording to hard disk drives and solid state memory when a 10gb disk drive for the camera was big. HDV was matched or exceeded at 17Mb/s...really closer to 13Mb/s. Although DV cameras had sensors that fully sampled their 720x480/576 images, the HD cameras all undersampled. The small sensors and high resolutions usually meant that the lens was also a limiting factor. Fast forward to 2009. CMOS and some CCD sensors do a full sampling or over sampling of HD. Lenses able to fully sample HD are regularly available. And sensors have improved. To capture video at a high quality, people have taken HDMI output through a Blackmagic Design Intensity card to record at 100Mb/s or more. The Canons used AVCHD on steroids...40-45Mb/s and it shows. The reason the 5DM2 is good is not only the sensor and the lens...it is that the image is recorded in a way that the lens and sensor can do their stuff. Back to the SX1. It has the same recording bandwidth, but a much smaller sensor and a, well, lens appropriate for a US$600 camera. In the US, the 5DM2 kit lens is US$1000. However the lens and sensor are comparable to HD camcorders costing up to US$1500. Sound on all camcorders regardless of price is awful. Unfortunately, there is no microphone input on the SX1. However a Zoom H2 or H4 can be purchased inexpensively so that is no really an issue. The lens and sensor, like all low end pieces, work fine if their is enough light. The biggest problem is chromatic aberration from the clips that I saw. In low light, it behaves like a small sensor camera. It does allow an AE lock. The 5DM2 doesn't...causing a ruckus among its owners. But the SX1 has problems. First, how stable is the AE lock. Second, how easy is it to focus...HD requires an accurate focus. Third and most important, how do you mount a filter? Video requires filters to look right. Outside, a circular polarizer is essential. Neutral density filters help deal with bright days...the small sensor limits you to an F8, and you really need to stay under F5.6 (this deals with how the lens handles contrast at different spacial frequencies, and a function of the small sensor). The only way are the neutal density (ND) filters. Because the cameras have limited dynamic range (would love a Fuji EXP HD camera) an Ultra Contrast filter is useful. And a small black diffusion (I use .5) works wonders indoors. So...my questions: 1) How do you mount a filter? 2) How easy is it to achieve and maintain the focus? 3) Does the AE lock work?</Content>
