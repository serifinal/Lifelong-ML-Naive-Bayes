The firmware upgrade adds some additional user controls: Shading Compensation Control - The original default setting for shading was always "on" with the older version of the firmware. Version 1.2 allows the user to turn on or off this setting that assists with the even dispersion of light to the edges of a captured image. Anti-Shock Function - This new feature allows the user to lock the mirror into place when they are concerned about the vibration caused by the movement of the mirror prior to exposure. Focus/Shutter Release Priority Menu selection for both Single Auto Focus Mode and Continuous-AF mode - This selectable option will allow users to control the shutter so that shots can be taken without waiting for the camera to confirm focus for faster shooting. The firmware update is easily accessible from the Help menu of the Olympus Master Software that ships with the camera. Hardware Calibration Device Overview The folks at Digital Outback photo have posted a nice overview of several hardware calibration devices. These devices are used to calibrate the color settings of CRT and LCD computer monitors for more accurated representation of colors in images. Read more here.</Content>
