		<Content>So yesterday I noticed a black spot in my pictures. I removed my filter...the lense...etc...and didn't find anything that would cause such a prominent black spot on all pictures. It gets more transparent when not focused on a subject, but I just can't figure it out. I'm new to this and don't want to risk taking my camera apart too much. I cleaned everything and still...it's there. any ideas as to what it could be? Here are some examples: http://www.dropbox.com/gallery/48738916/1/spot?h=74835b</Content>
