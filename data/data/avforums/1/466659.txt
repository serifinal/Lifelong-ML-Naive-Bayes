		<Content>Hi guys, Having had great exeprience with my 37" Panasonic plasma, i'm very tempted to go Panasonic again, with the 50" 1080P model. I can get this for around £550, which seems an awesome deal. However, i'm also intrigued by the equivalent LG model, which is available around £465, again, a ridiculous deal it seems. Question is, how do the two brands generally compare? For the sake of an extra £85 odd for the Panasonic it seems daft not to. What do you think?</Content>
