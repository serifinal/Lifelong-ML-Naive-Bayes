		<Content>Hi guys, this is probably a long shot, but has anyone got a spare tuner/media box for a Hitachi 42PD3000 plasma tv? it dates back to 2002 so i'm sure there should be a few knocking around by now. it is quite urgent, as i sold the tv and it bounced back a month later with the tuner box gone faulty beyond repair as far as i can tell. so i need to buy another box before having to hand back Â£200 to my customer as a refund.</Content>
