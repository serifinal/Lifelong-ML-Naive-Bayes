		<Content>We have a 42" Panasonic PE50, about 6yrs old, we want to get a 50" with HD. We watch with a V+ box, but so far not able to watch any HD as TV is too old. I am looking at either the Panasonic TX-P50C3B which is HD ready or the TX-50u30b which is full HD. We need to be able to connect the V+ bos and our old dvd recorder which is the Panasonic DMR-ES20. WE have been very pleased with the tv we have, would just like a bit bigger now. Any suggestions very welcome. many Thanks</Content>
