		<Content>Hello everyone, I've had my TX-P50G20 for about 2yrs now. What a fantastic TV. Without needing to add to the already glowing reviews, I can say it's one of the best buys I've made, and I still continue to marvel at the fabulous picture. Now, in my region here in Norfolk, they've finally switched over to Freeview HD, which means I can now receive BBC HD, ITV HD, C4 HD channels using the built-in Freeview HD receiver. Picture is indeed great, but the audio is strangely poor on the 4 HD channels. Upon checking my Amp (Denon 2311), it is not receiving 5.1 signal, only the L & R (2.0). I've gone through all the settings in my Amp and TV, and simply can't get 5.1 it to work. I've tried switching between ARC and SPDIF digital outputs too, but again no difference. The TV channel guide information does not register that the programs are broadcasting in 5.1 - since the manual says "MultiChannel" should be displayed - but it isn't. Now, upon searching this forum, I've found a post which say the TV is not able to decode Freeview HD Multi-Channel audio. If that's correct, that's surely unbelievable! If that's correct I'm going to need to get a new TV. Surely if a TV is sold as High Definition, that includes Audio and Video (ok, I'm being rather hopeful here I know!). Freeview HD - 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround? Is my TV flawed? Have I really bought a Panasonic HD TV with built-in Freeview HD, which does not allow me to use the Freeview HD channels because it can't decode Multi-Channel 5.1 surround? Must I stick to watching the SD channels because the audio is better? Help!</Content>
