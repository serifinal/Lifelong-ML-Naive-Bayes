		<Content>I have been using this plasma for years now in a second room. We are now making some changes and it will go yet to another room. However, there is a space limitation and I want to move the plasma speakers from the sides and attach them at the bottom of the display. I have the supplied brackets for installing them like this, but I have discarded the longer support colums required for the PDK-TS04 table top stand that will allow for this speaker position. Has anyone who has/had a 434 plasma still have this longer support column and who does not need them? If needed I can pay something towards them. Thanks in advance.</Content>
