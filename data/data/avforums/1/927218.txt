		<Content>I'm in the market for a new TV and have more or less decided on a Panasonic 42" plasma. Not being very flush with cash, I'm looking at low end models and will probably go for a U30 or S30. But now I see an S31 model appearing. Does anyone know the difference between the S30 and S31?</Content>
