		<Content>Hi there, looking for a bit of confirmation really... I have struck a deal with my local Panasonic store for £980 to include the TX-P42GT30 the DMP-BD110 BD player(worth between £150-£180 after searches) and 4 3D blurays including Avatar (which i understand is worth about £60-£80 on it's own) Good deal????? Considering the TX-P42G30 is now only £686.90 on amazon?</Content>
