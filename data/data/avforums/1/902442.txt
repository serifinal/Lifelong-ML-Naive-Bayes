		<Content>Hello, I'm thinking of buying a new tv, and I would need some advices. I want a Panasonic plasma (I own one) and I want 42'. Problem is - which model to chose ? In my country, Romania, I found it 5 models that look good - and I dont know what to choose. so, if you own one of these models or know a lot about tvs, your oppinion could really help me. The models I found: - TX-P42G10 - TX-P42S20 - TX-P42GT20 - TX-P42U30 - TX-P42S30 I want the tv for gaming (xbox 360 & ps3) and movies (blue rays and dvs). I own many dvds, so I want a tv that display the SD material at least decently. Now my problem is that every model comes with pros and cons. I will tell you also the prices - for comparisson - the prices are in romanian coin (ron) - G10: 2400 ron. The oldest, but when it came out, I read a lot of great reviews (including on cnet). My concerns with it: 1. it is said that during time, the black gets deeper ? or deteriorates ?(I heard something like that on cnet). 2. I read on televisioninfo that G10 dose not handle the motion very well (they say that a lot of artifacts appears). Is it true ? - S20: 2300 ron. - Gt20: 3200 ron. The most expensive, but it has 3D. But I would like to know about the image quality (2D) - is there a significant difference in comparisson with the other models in order to justify the 50% price up ? I mean, it looks the most well rounded tv when it comes to image quality, but does this translate into a significant image difference ? (or is just on paper) - U30: 2200 ron. The least expensive. It's a new model, but an entry one too - isn't it a little too cheap ? -how is the image quality ? On specifications says that in motion has only 900 lines (unlike S20 -1080 lines) - does this affect the quality ? is it a cheaper processor ? - S30: 2650/2850 ron. Another new entry. I haven't found reviews for it so I don't know much. I would like your oppinion regarding which model has the best image quality - BUT - take into the consideration the price too. the GT20 might be better than U30, but does this justiy the 50% price up ? (if the image quality is only a little better - you might not notice in practice, so it's not worthy.) Thank you. PS: sorry for my english, I am not an english speaker.</Content>
