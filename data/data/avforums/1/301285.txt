		<Content>Hi guys, about 7 or so years ago I bought a Panny Viera 42" and have been very happy with it, but its now time to replace it with a HD TV. When I installed it all those years back I wall mounted it and fed a number of cables, 3 meters behind the plasterboard an through a couple of holes drilled through a wall (as the sources are in an alcove, silly house design) - 2 x scart leads, 1 set of RGB Components, I set of Phono audio (that feeds audio from the tv to the amp) and an Aerial lead, it was hard work and I know I need HDMI leads but want to make it as easy as possible. I am looking to get a 50" Panny VT30, as I have almost convinced myself that Â£800 more for the 55" is just too much extra for 5 inches. I will probably purchased the TV from Jonh Lewis, Richer Sounds or TPS. Will also be getting a Blu ray player to replace my DVD player. I have read through the VT30 owners thread and some/most of the VT30 calibration thread, but seem to have confused myself and now have more questions than answers. So I would like to ask the following: 1. After delivery of the TV should I check for the Green Blob issues and dead pixels straight away or wait until its run in? 2. If I find any green blob issues or dead pixels should I send the TV back or run it in and then check for them? 3. If I do return the TV for a replacement or refund due to the green blob etc, do I have to pay for carrige or the retailer and how long do they take to replace the TV? 4. What is the best way to run in the TV? 5. Will I ever need 2 x scarts ever again, should I remove one or both from my wall, same goes for the RGB and the Audio? 6. How many HDMI should I fit into the wall and is there other cables I should fit whilst I am at it? Have a wireless router so dont need network cable. 7. Are there any issues with HDMI cables fitting into the Panny and are angled connectors ok to use (to help hide the cables) I think thats all the questions I have (at the moment anyway) Many Thanks</Content>
