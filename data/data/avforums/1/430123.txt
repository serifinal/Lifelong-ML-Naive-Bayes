		<Content>After ploughing through many threads and review,it has came down to a straight choice for me between Pansonic TX-P42S30B And Samsung PS-43D450 Both have good review despite being at the bottom end of the range,especially the samsung despite only being 780,I'm not a gamer and not a big film fan,so it would just be everyday virgin hd use What would the buffs opt for,I'm upgrading from an old CRT lump btw</Content>
