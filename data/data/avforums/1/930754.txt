		<Content>I am one of those people who care hear the tv emit a high pitch when the tv is turned on. I currently bought a Panasonic Plasma tv and it is making my ears ring. Can anyone recommend a 50 inch HDTV that does not have this high pitch that is currently available? LCD, Plasma, LED. Looking for around $1000. Thanks.</Content>
