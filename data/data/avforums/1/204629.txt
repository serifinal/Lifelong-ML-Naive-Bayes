		<Content>Hi, I am gonna buy a new TV and the viewing distance is about 5 m (= 17 feet). I am considering a 64" Plasma, Samsung PS64D8005. I have two questions. 1. Is a 64" TV suitable for this distance? 2. The TV will be used a lot for playing Wii. Will the picture be totally unviewable with a TV at this size? The Wii doesn't support HD. Thanks! And a happy new year!</Content>
