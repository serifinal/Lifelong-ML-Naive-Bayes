		<Content>Hi, as header, my mother has asked me for advice on which 40" (ish) new tv to buy, and as i asked for advice here a couple of years ago when my girlfriend was wanting a new set i thought i'd try here again, as the LG i was recommended was a belter, cant remember the model but it was the only 32" plasma on the market at the time .. .. Budget £500.00 to £700.00 What do you guys reckon ? Thanks in advance !!</Content>
