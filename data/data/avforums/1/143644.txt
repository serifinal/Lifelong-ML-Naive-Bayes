		<Content>Richer sounds are selling the VT20 at £800.The GT30 can be found for £850 so nothing in it. which is the best option for 2D TV and DVD. I have a projector in a different room for BR. So mostly for terretrial and DVD's when I want to watch an old films and not be reminded of low resolution on a 134" screen. This will be stand alone in terms of sound. Any thoughts on the extra £500 on the VT30</Content>
