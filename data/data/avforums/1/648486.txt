		<Content>Hi i currently have a 42 panasonic viera 42" bought in june 2008 and i am looking at upgrading to a 60" plasma. At the moment i am swaying towards LG 60PZ250T which is £1350 from amazon, . Samsung have a 59" 3D model also which is £1250 i think. I dont know which has the edge LG or samsung for plasma. My current panasonic 42" does not have great Standard def terestrial picture upscaling so i am looking for a TV with improved Standard Def picture quality. Plus of course the LG comes with a FREEVIEW HD tuner. Any one got any advice ot experience?.</Content>
