		<Content>Hi All, Sorry this has been asked before and I have trawled back, however there are a couple of questions I have that were not asked about comparisons in other threads I found. I'm treating myself to a PS3 and an HD TV. It's been long enough now and it is time I got involved. I'd ideally like to do this to the cheaper end of things (initial thoughts were 200-250 for the TV, but I'm now thinking it may be worth spending up a little higher?). I am flexible as I inevitably get tempted and I don't mind paying extra if there is genuine value in doing so. I'll be looking to hold on to the TV for quite a few years anyway. The first TV that I thought looked alright was this one: Toshiba 32BV801B 32in Full-HD 1080p Freeview HD LCD TV | Ebuyer.com Mainly due to being full HD and having a freeview HD tuner. I do have a socket from the virgin/internal aerial in my room, but the virgin has been terminated and the aerial on the roof is rubbish.....so whether or not I would be able to adequately pick up the hd channels or not anyway I do not know. I then continued looking and saw the Sony had received great reviews http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/tvs/1...ia-kdl-32cx523 So that is also tempting. Again, the LAN isnt in my room so whether or not I'd use the internet TV is open to debate. The cost of the Sony dongle is enormous. I do have a pc with a semi decent monitor anyway and was considering of mounting the TV nearby anyway, which I presume would then make it just as easy to stream the pc through the tv....Truth be told there's a strong chance it never gets mounted though. It would make for the best viewing but would look a little odd hanging over the desk. Finally, some others recommended this Panasonic. PANASONIC Viera TX-L32U3B 32" Full HD LCD TV buy online | Currys Could someone point me in the right direction please? Even if just to rubbish the current three outlined and start me afresh elsewhere. Ideally around the 250 mark but can squeeze to 300ish if it is truly worthwhile. Alternatively, is there any value in going to a shop to try and negotiate a tv and PS3 bundle? Sorry, this post is convoluted and confusing....indicative of how I am finding this technology hunt.</Content>
