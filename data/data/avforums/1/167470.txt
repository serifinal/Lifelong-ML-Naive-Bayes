		<Content>Hi all, I've currently got a year old : Panasonic TXP50S20B which I am very happy with, but after seeing my daughters : Panasonic TXL32DT30B I now fancy 3D!!! I've been looking at this on JL's website which is priced less than my current TV cost me: TX-P50ST30 Can anyone please tell me if this is a better set than my current one (exception of 3D and smart features of course!). My major concern in PQ through Sky primarily. Many thanks in advance</Content>
