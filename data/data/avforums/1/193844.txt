		<Content>Hi All Has anyone had any experiences with the two TV sets mentioned above? 3D performance is not really a big issue. I had the 50" Panny V20 before this, which I have now sold. I would like to buy something smaller and have narrowed it down to these two - effectively the best plasma set and LED set available at the moment. Your opinions would be very much appreciated. Thanks in advance!</Content>
