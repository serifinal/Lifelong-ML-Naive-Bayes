		<Content>Hello. The wife and I are looking to buy a blue-ray player. We have come accros a nive bargain for the Panasonic DMP-BD110EB 3D Blue-Ray player. Our telly is 6 months old and is a Panasonic Viera PX-T42G20B which is not 3D. However, is it possible to view 3D movies on this tely through the blue-ray player? Any comments well appreciated. Cheers.</Content>
