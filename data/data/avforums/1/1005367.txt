		<Content>I am looking to buy a Panasonic 50vt30 soon but have a question... I currently have a high quality HDMI cable installed into the wall to my av amplifier....its only 1.3 Will this work at all if supplying the tv with full 1080p 3D? or will I need to replace the cable for it to work? Thanks</Content>
