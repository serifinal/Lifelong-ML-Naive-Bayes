		<Content>Hi, I am trying to decide if the extra 8'' are worth or not the Â£450 price difference. Are there any differences between the two in terms of picture quality besides the size? I have seen the 59'' model which was just stunning, is the 51'' basically the same but in a smaller package? Thanks in advance</Content>
