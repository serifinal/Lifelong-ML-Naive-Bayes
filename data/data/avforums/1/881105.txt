		<Content>Hey all I'm on the look out for a new 50" Panasonic Plasma TV (As I'm always blown away by the quality of images on the the screens). About a year ago I had a 50" Panasonic Plasma TX-P50G20Bbut the buzz (when there were bright white images on the screen) was just unbearable, so it had to go back to Amazon. I was wondering whats around today that might suit me that doesnt have this awful problem? Thanks</Content>
