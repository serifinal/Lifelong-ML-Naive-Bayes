		<Content>Right guys, I need to decide between the Panasonic 50VT30 and the Samsung 51D8000. I could probably go up in size to the 64D8000 but 55" Panasonic would be a push because of my retailer not stocking it and I don't wont/can't go elsewhere at the moment. What are the pros and cons of the two sets? I am hearing good experiences on both and the VT30</Content>
