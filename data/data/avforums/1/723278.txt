		<Content>Hi all! I have recently returned my samsung ps63c7000 for a refund due to blinking and sync issues and at the moment putting up with a 40" led which is quite a shock in size! so the dilema- do i go for the ps64d8000 or maybe the ps59d6900 or wait to see if the new models have moved on? Not sure what the difference is betwen the 64d8000 and 59d6900 apart from size and finish? Would appreciate help as just not sure what to do!Cheers</Content>
