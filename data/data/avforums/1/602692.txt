		<Content>I'm considering getting one of these TVs. I note that the resolution is only 1024x768 though? I watch mainly sports and normal programmes. I sit around 3m away from the tv. I'm considering a 1080p 40" LCD tv as well that's the same price. I know little about TVs so any help would be appreciated! Thanks</Content>
