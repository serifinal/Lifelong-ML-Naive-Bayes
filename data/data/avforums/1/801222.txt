		<Content>I'm returning my 50" GT30 to Dixons for green splotches and decided to pay a little extra for a 5 year warranty so I've reserved one at Richer Sounds, but before I actually go and buy it I need some help with this decision. All my research lead me to the conclusion that next to the VT30, the GT30 is this years best plasma and 50" is the perfect size for my viewing distance (7-8') but nothing prepared me for the amount of dithering noise. I'm sure I can get used to it when I've got everything set up properly to minimise it, but I find it's heavily detrimental to the picture quality when I do notice it. (In all fairness, it's usually only in downloaded rips where it combines forces with compression artifacts.) Would I be much better off with a 46" version? Other than being smaller and losing motion resolution in 1080p 3D are there any other differences? I plan make to make heavy use of 3D for gaming, so the Panasonics seem to be my only real choice. Since we can't get 1080p60 3D the loss of resolution is moot for gaming, but is it even that big a deal for films? Does anyone know how the PS51D6900 compares with respect to dithering? It's slightly bigger so I'm assuming it's worse. Reviews tend to gloss over the whole issue and are no help to me whatsoever. The idea is for whatever I buy to last me several years and I really don't want to spend more on an inferior LCD, so my only other option is to just get something cheap to tide me over and see what happens over the next year or two. At the moment I'm leaning heavily towards sticking with 50" G30.</Content>
