		<Content>Been looking on the web, ebay etc and can't seem to find any second hand ones for sale at much below price of a new TV Maybe just a lack of availibility. So would anyone have an approx idea of how much they'd think is an OK price to pay for a second hand TX-P42G10B As far as I know the one I can have if I want it is in good/very good condition & is around 12-18 months old.</Content>
