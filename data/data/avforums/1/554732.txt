		<Content>I have a P42G20B panasonic TV. I'm currently using SKY, but will want to switch to the tv's own freesat when i cancel SKY. Unfortunately the centre speaker of my 5.1 system sits infront of the TV, making it impossible to control the TV. I was wondering if its possible to attach an external infrared module to the tv? Couldnt seem to find anything on google. I'm looking at spending Â£20-30 (no more, as i could put that towards a freesat box) Thanks</Content>
