		<Content>The above package is retailing for around £670+. Does anyone know where I can buy it for under £600? I know there is only £70 in it but I started out my search looking for a blu ray only and have since moved up to a TV also and now onto complete packages. After much deliberation and researching I have found the 32" version for around £480. My current Sony Bravia is 32" and I would like to upgrade to the 37" if possible but I don't want to break the bank either Many thanks</Content>
