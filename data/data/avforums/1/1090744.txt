		<Content>Does anyone have any recommendations? I was looking around at the Samsung PS43D450A2W and its 3D counterpart for a while and it seemed to have something called "Clear Image Panel" but from reviews/opinions it doesn't seem to cut reflections and such down. To make matters worse I went on the Samsung US site for this same TV and it says it has Filterbright technology but clearly the UK version does not. At the moment I have just recieved an LG 42PT353K and I simply cannot stand the reflections. Can anyone help me with a finding a decent priced Plasma with decent antio-reflective please? (And yes, I know, get decent curtains and light shade.)</Content>
