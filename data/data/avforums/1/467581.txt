		<Content>Evening everyone. I'm on a mission to find myself a 3D TV. I've heard great things about the ST and GT 30 models. Now, on Amazon the ST30 is £650 and the GT30 is £850. What's the difference between the two models and is the GT30 worth £200 more? PS my primary use for the TV will be gaming and watching Blu-rays, both in 2D and 3D. PSS could anyone post some pics if you own one of the TVs please? Thanks in advance</Content>
