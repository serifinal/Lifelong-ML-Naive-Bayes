		<Content>I'am looking into buying a new tv I have a 40in lcd samsung some people say the newer samsungs led picture looks like your there is this true with the panasonic st30 and seems leds or better picture? 42in plasmas? I was looking at bestbuy and theres tons of lcds and led and only a few plasma tvs so I couldn't get to view very many plasmas because they were all huge and I'am looking for something smaller or the bigger plasmas that much of a difference between say 60in and 42in I cant go bigger then 42in tv so should I lean more towards led? only way to test plasma is to bring it home thanks</Content>
