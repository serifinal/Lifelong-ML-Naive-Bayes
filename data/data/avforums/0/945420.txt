		<Content>Hi guys. I got this tv last week and never having had a plasma tv before i'm really struggling to get a decent picture from it. Is setting up a plasma so different from an LCD? I've had 3 LG LCD's and never had much problems re picture settings. I can't find any threads about this tv anywhere. Does anyone have any suggestions. Many Thanks</Content>
