		<Content>My LG plasma TV is not powering on via the original remote control or the cable remote control, however when i touch the power button at the base of the TV, it responds and turns on, but now when i turn off the tv by hitting the power button on either remote, it turns off and not on. This is an urgent situation and I cannot figure out what is wrong. If anyone can assist i would greatly appreciate it.</Content>
