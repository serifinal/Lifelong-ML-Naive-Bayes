		<Content>Hi guys I have sky linked thru my onkyo r608 and then from onkyo into my 50vt30. Whenever I turn my tv on it says no channels found which doesn't bother me because I just use sky thru hdmi. However I wouldn't mind setting up freesat hd and freeview hd how do I go about setting it up. What cables need to go where. Thanks</Content>
