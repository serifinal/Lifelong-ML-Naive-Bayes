		<Content>For a little while I noticed my Panasonic Plasma 42 flickered whilst on the PS3 (input via HDMi), but never off the Panny DVD player or sky (input by Scart). Therefore wasn?t sure if it was the PS3 doing it, or the HDMi ports in the TV. Well, last night enough was enough because the flickering went from one each hour to happening every minute, sometimes twice a minute. I originally thought its maybe the TV being the cause, as often when it jumps, it doesn?t just judder the picture but it also forces an Aspect Ratio change. I have my TV set to 16:9 (not wide or auto). But the problem occurs often whereby it changes the aspect by its self; going from 16:9 to Wide (possibly caused by bad information sent by ps3?). In doing so, it takes about 1.5 seconds, and gives me a blank black screen; so obviously impossible to game or watch Bluray-DVD's. But coincidently I noticed my dad?s brand new panny 46? (400hz S10) also jumps about aspect ratio when playing DVD?s that income from HDMi via an Arcam amp (but only does so very rarely); so maybe it is the TV. My TV is less than 1 year old. On the title screen of the PS3 ? a static image ? I can see lines of snowing or breaking up intermittently; but this does not occur on the AV1 AV2 etc channels, just the HDMi. Leave it a while and the screen begins to jump about. This happens on all 3 of the HDMi in ports on the TV. So I?m inclined to think it?s the source that maybe the problem, not the TV. So tried a spare HDMi cable; that too is problematic; so maybe its the actual source, the PS3? Unfortunately I have no other HDMi source boxes; no spare PS3 or anything. Without that test I can?t tell if it?s the PS3; I was thinking of finding someone with a HDMi tv and plugging MY ps3 into it. Before doing so: Has anyone else had an issue with their TV picture jumping about when plugged into a PS3?</Content>
