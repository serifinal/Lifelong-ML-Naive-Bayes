		<Content>Whilst watching HD Freeview on my LG 50'' every 15-60 seconds I get a very brief black screen, similar to the shutter on a SLR camera, or the blink of an eye. It doesnt happen on blu ray, or my PS3 games. I have retuned, checked settings, reset tv to factory settings, no cure yet. Any ideas?</Content>
