		<Content>I had 42lg5000 for 3 years. Yesterday i bought 50pz250 and it's not so bright like 42lg5000 maybe 1/3 42lg5000 of brightness. I tryed picture settings... set to bright ... and it's not so bright like i want. How can i downgrade firmware to 03.13.33 from 03.42.13.11, may by problem is in firmware. The default firmware when i bought were 03.42.13.11...</Content>
