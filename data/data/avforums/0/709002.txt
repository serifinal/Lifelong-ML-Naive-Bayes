		<Content>I realise that the "sound but no picture" question must have been asked countless times...so I apologise for starting another thread. I've had a search through different threads but need some specific info please. First of all...I have no experience in fixing TV's but am hoping to save my mother a few quid as it's her TV. It's a Tevion 42" plasma which is basically a Samsung on the inside. I removed the back cover and noticed a burning smell which I thought was coming from the 'Y MAIN' and so I replaced that part however it made no difference. I found the cause of the smell to be the 'Y BUFFER (UP)' and the far right-hand chip seems to be the culprit as the gold pins have a burnt/brown patch. I then removed the 'Y BUFFER (UP)' and powered the set up (not attached to any input). This time the bottom half of the screen had multiple random coloured flashing pixels. I've found a replacement 'Y BUFFER (UP)' but before ordering it I thought I'd get some advice: A. From the fault I've described does anyone know if a new 'Y BUFFER (UP)' is likely to rectify the problem? B. I've heard that a faulty BUFFER could damage the MAIN...is this true? As mentioned above I powered up the set briefly with the faulty BUFFER attached to the new MAIN so I'm hoping I haven't damaged that. There also appears to be a fast clicking noise coming from the set but I don't know if this is normal as it's very faint and you have to put your ear really close to hear it. There are no flashing LED's etc that give a fault code. The power light goes from amber (standby) to green (on) as normal.</Content>
