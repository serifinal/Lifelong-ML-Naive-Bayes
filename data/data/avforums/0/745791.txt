		<Content>I have acquired a Panasonic TH42PZ81 and am quite pleased with it but one small gremlin in the works is bugging me. The TV is plugged into a Sony RHT-G900 [all in one stand/sound system] which has a PS3 and Xbox 360 plugged into it & everything is connected via HDMI. Occasionally when I switch to HDMI1 which is the channel the stand is on & power on the PS3 or Xbox the colours of red and blue are swapped. Simply turning either console off then on again solves it but I was wondering if anyone has ever come across this and knows of a solution ?</Content>
