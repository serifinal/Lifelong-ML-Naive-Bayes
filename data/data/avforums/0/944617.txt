		<Content>Ive made this thread to be a central hub for all FBr talks. I will try and keep this first post updated with the names of those effected by FBr's, if they got fixed by a FW update issued by Panasonic (please no unofficial FW posts it will add to the confusion) or if your set doesnt have any at all without updates. Please post your model number and screen size. Eg 55" VT30, and the production date normally found at the back of the tv on the right hand side in one of the vent holes. Will try and post pictures for the VT30 later as to where this is. Also the firmware version of the set. I'll kick it off UK 2011 Panasonics TX-P65VT30- with FBr's AndyVT30-Production date Unknown, Firmware version 1.520 (updated from 1.518) Smudge Mouse-Production date Unknown, Firmware version 1.518 TX-P55VT30B- with FBr's [/U][/B]Insanity202-Production date April 2011, Firmware version 1.520 (updated from 1.518) gaz2810i-Production date March 2011, Firmware version 1.518 (updated from 1.516) gaz2810i-Production date May 2011, Firmware version 1.518 pre-installed martpu-Production date March 2011, Firmware version 1.518 pre-installed martpu-Production date April 2011, Firmware version 1.518 pre-installed Rotor1999-Production date Unknown, Firmware version 1.518 pre-installed Rotor1999-Production date Unknown, Firmware version 1.518 pre-installed TX-P50VT30B- with FBr's Rotor1999-Production date Unknown, Firmware version 1.520 pre-installed TX-P50GT30B- with FBr's Tele1962-Production date Unknown, Firmware version 1.213 (updated from 1.206) TX-P46GT30- with FBr's Andi C- Production date Unknown, Firmware version 1.213 (original firmware 1.206) madmonk3y- Production date Unknown, Firmware version 1.213 (original firmware 1.206) Theory information What is Fbr ? (symptoms) The patent and schematics The ramp (small descending steps) of the patent doesn't work on all parts of the picture, for some there is a delayed direct jump from level A to level B. The Eprom update/board replacement in US fixes it and introduces also some tweaks at 0-40 IRE levels affecting slighly white balance and gamma. What about EU/UK ? No official word yet but there is some hope. Massive thanks to Orso for the information UPDATE Link to latest FW from Panny site http://panasonicuk.epticahosting.com...te.do?id=49297 Make sure you read it all etc etc. If you still have issues with FBr's please post back here. Like wise if they go please let us know. Must also point out this from the linky Quote:</Content>
