		<Content>I was watching TV and my Vizio VP50 shut off. No lights on or any indication of power. I unplugged it and plugged back in. Any ideas where I can research and see if a component can be replaced? Perhaps it's a component for the power that needs replaced. TV is 3 years old and out of warranty. Paul Parker, CO</Content>
