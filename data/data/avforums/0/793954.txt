		<Content>Hi Just before Christmas our samsung lcd tv started playing up, luckily we were still in warranty by about month, so we were able to pick another tv to a certain value. We have now gone for a 50" Panasonic Plasma tv. I'm not sure however if we have a faulty set. Is it normal for a plasma to have colour/picture distortion on fast moving images?? Its quite hard to explain what I mean, all i can compare it to is you know when you press your finger on a calculator screen it goes funny, well its similiar to that As I have never had or watched a plasma tv I have no idea whether this is normal. Sorry to sound so vague! Thanks</Content>
