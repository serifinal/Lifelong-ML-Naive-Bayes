		<Content>Hi all, I have recently bought a Panasonic TX-P42S30B and currently have it wired to my BT homehub. I can access the onboard internet features fine, but can't seem to make any media servers appear on the TV - I have tried twonky and wild media - both can detect the TV, but the TV never seems to show any sign of recognising the presence of a media server?? Any suggestions for will it work/how can i get it to work?? I'm truly stumped...</Content>
