		<Content>My new Panasonic gt30 arrives tomorrow, this will be my first plasma as only ever had LCD displays before. I am intending to build a false wall to accommodate my new purchase and have the whole house to decorate in the coming weeks, this probably sounds a silly question but will it be ok to use the plasma for the next few weeks for the break in period then box it up when my diy project begins or is it best to leave it until I'm ready to hang it in it's permanent position??</Content>
