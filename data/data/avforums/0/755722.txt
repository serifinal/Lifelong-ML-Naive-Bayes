		<Content>Hello, I have a Panasonic G20. After watching movies on a TV channel for an entire afternoon, the logo now appears almost permanently ? it?s especially visible with gray gradients. In order to get rid of it, I played the Toy Story Blu-ray more than twenty times. I also ran the famous white scrolling bar for more than twenty hours. Unfortunately, the channel logo is still there ? actually, I haven?t noticed any difference between before and after my attempts. Is there anything I can do? Thanks!</Content>
