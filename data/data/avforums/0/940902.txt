		<Content>Over the last few days I have been trying to calibrate my C680 with little success. Currently running: Movie 18 Cell light 85 Contrast 60 Brightness 45 Sharpness 50 Colour Black tone OFF Dynamic contrast OFF Gamma 0 Colour space AUTO White balance: 28, 25, 26, 10, 25, 26 Colour tone WARM 1 everything else either off or at defaults This is used on hdmi 2 for all sources; being Xbox 360, bluray and tv. Calibrated using THX DVD, commander shep's settings and Xbox 360 (FIFA 11 / assassins creed brotherhood and matrix reloaded bluray. Basically I'm finding that dynamic gives a much more punchy picture, with my movie settings giving a "misty" (for want of a better word) picture. Also, even at only warm 1, the picture (especially whites) appear to have an unnatural orange tinge. This only appears to be relieved by setting dynamic contrast to medium/high, which I was under the impression was a bad thing? Using th THX disc, brightness seems to be perfect at 60, but contrast seemingly has no effect on the THX contrast test? I'm not entirely sure if 90 is an ok setting...? If cell light is set any lower, the picture appears too dark and some detail is lost. Sharpness needs to be around 45 as otherwise detail is lost on textures etc in games. Black tone and dynamic contrast seem to greatly improve the clarity of the picture and removes the grey/misty film which is quite apparent.... Does nobody else with movie mode see this? So far, movie mode seems to be worse than dynamic as no matter what is changed, the same punchy colour and depth to the picture cantle obtained? It always looks "less clear"... Also, 3d mode suffers even further unless dynamic contrast and colour tone and gamma are adjusted to make the picture more like the standard setting. Cell also needs to be at 20 to compensate for lack of brightness! 3d mode highlights an awful amount of dithering (red and green sparkling dots when viewed from 4/5 feet), is there no way to remove this? Isn't a big deal but lcd's don't do it so why does a plasma? Another problem is that I have noticed that the tv appears to adjust brightness between some scenes in films (very slightly and infrequently, but I have noticed it the last few nights...) movie mode is set and dynamic contrast turned off so I thought it shouldn't be doing this?? Finally, the buzzing varies from scene to scene and it's volume and pitch also change depending on how high the cell light is... Can anyone truthfully claim any different? Thanks all!</Content>
