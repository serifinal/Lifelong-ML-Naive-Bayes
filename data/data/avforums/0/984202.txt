		<Content>Splashed out £3200 3 years ago on an LX5090, been mildly impressed with picture quality during that time. My father in law has purchased a £600 Samsung and the PQ is a million times better than mine - it's awesome, super sharp. Seriously ****** off man, what the hell is all that about?? Some of you will no doubt say that it's imperative to get it ISF'd but, WHY? As if paying out over £3k on a tv is not enough, I have to spend a further £300 on making it look as good as a £600 set. Not happy man. Waste of money, case in point. Rant over.</Content>
