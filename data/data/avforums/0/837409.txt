		<Content>Hi All Is it ok to turn the switch off at the wall every night for my Samsung PS42B430 Plasma? I turn the TV off via the touch button on the front, but the red power light stays on, there is no on/off physical switch, and so I have been turning the switch off as well.. Whats your thoughts? Cheers Steve</Content>
