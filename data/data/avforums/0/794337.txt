		<Content>Recently my Panasonic TH42PZ70b TV has developed an issue with small green lines appearing when light coloured screens are displayed, but it seems fine on darker colours. I don&#8217;t know what the issue is so haven&#8217;t had much luck on Google. Picture attached&#8230;&#8230;let me know if you know what it might be. Note its not the darker green bar across the top, I think that was normal.</Content>
