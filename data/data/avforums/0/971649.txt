		<Content>Hi I have just bought a Netgear wireless adaptor to connect my viera tv to viera connect. I have tried both wired and wireless connections and in each case I get an error saying "cannot connect etc (005)" I have had a look at my router settings (a BT open hub) and all looks ok in terms of network I have run the connection tests and all tests are passed Is the sever down? is this a regular issue people have seen? Cheers for all your help</Content>
