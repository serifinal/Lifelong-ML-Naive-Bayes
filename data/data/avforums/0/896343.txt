		<Content>Hi Guys.. I have a Samsung PS42Q7HD PLASMA television making clicking noise and won't power on. The screen lights up for half a second and then goes off. It just does this continually. Everything that I read about Samsung televisions indicate tht it is soe capacitors that are faulty. I have taken out the power supply an all capacitors seem to be OK with a visual check. I have checked the 5 vold line and that is quite stable. I think that it must be the relay that is kicking in abd then out again. Has anybody got any idea how to cure this problem ??? Thanks, John C</Content>
