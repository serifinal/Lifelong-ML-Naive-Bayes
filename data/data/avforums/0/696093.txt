		<Content>I just purchased this TV today and I was happy with it until you go to a black screen (PS3,TV,XboX,anything) you can see what i'd almost call snow from a regular old set however it is grey,red and sometimes green dots. Is this a new plasma problem that resolves itself over time or what? I'm pretty worried so any help will be very much appreciated!!!!!</Content>
