		<Content>I just purchased a Yamaha 671 AV receiver. I have connected that to my TV but am struggling with the HDMI management. The instructions booklet of the Yamaha says that I should connect to the TV using different method depending on whether the TV is equipped with ARC (Audio Return Channel) or HDMI control... How can I tell if my TV is equipped with either of these? The TV is a Panasonic TH-46PZ80 Thanks</Content>
